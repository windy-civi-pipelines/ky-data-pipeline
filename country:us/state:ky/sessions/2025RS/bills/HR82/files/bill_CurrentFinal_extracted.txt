UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 2006
2 Degeneration Awareness Week.
3 WHEREAS, frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) is an incurable and terminal
4 neurodegenerative disease that affects the frontal and temporal lobes, causing
5 impairments to speech, personality, behavior, and motor skills; and
6 WHEREAS, more than 60,000 Americans are estimated to be affected by FTD; and
7 WHEREAS, though the disease may strike individuals between the age of 21 and
8 80, the highest percentage of those afflicted are between the age of 45 and 64; and
9 WHEREAS, FTD is the most common form of dementia affecting individuals
10 younger than 60 years of age; and
11 WHEREAS, although FTD is now better diagnosed, those afflicted with FTD may
12 still wait well over three years from the onset of symptoms to receive a definitive
13 diagnosis by a specialized physician; and
14 WHEREAS, FTD has often previously been misdiagnosed as a psychiatric disorder
15 or neurodegenerative disease because FTD's wide range of cognitive and behavioral
16 symptoms manifest themselves at a fairly young age; and
17 WHEREAS, in the behavioral variant of FTD, a person’s sense of social graces and
18 appropriate behavior can be lost, and their personality may be significantly changed; and
19 WHEREAS, in the language variant of FTD, primary progressive aphasia, a person
20 may have trouble producing speech and understanding grammar, lose the meaning of
21 words, or become hesitant in their speech, and may eventually become mute; and
22 WHEREAS, in the movement variant of FTD, a person may experience muscle
23 weakness, falling, loss of balance, difficulty making speech, difficulty swallowing, or
24 choking; and
25 WHEREAS, FTD affects a person's ability to express emotion, show affection,
26 speak, maintain muscle strength, and swallow and, in sum, has a devastating impact on
27 the entire personality, rendering individuals in the prime of life unable to live a normal

1 life or maintain a livelihood; and
2 WHEREAS, the economic burden of FTD is estimated to be twice that required for
3 individuals with the better-known Alzheimer's Disease; and
4 WHEREAS, the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration is the leading
5 association advocating for increased awareness of the nature and effects of FTD and is
6 exclusively focused on the spectrum of FTD disorders with a mission to improve the
7 quality of life of people affected by FTD and drive research to a cure; and
8 WHEREAS, Frontotemporal Degeneration Awareness Week provides an
9 opportunity for all Kentuckians to learn more about this singular form of dementia,
10 support research into treatments and a cure, and offer comfort to those who have been
11 affected by the disease; and
12 WHEREAS, it is imperative that there be greater awareness of this serious disease,
13 and more must be done to increase education and research at the local, state, and national
14 levels;
15 NOW, THEREFORE,
16 Be it resolved by the House of Representatives of the General Assembly of the
