UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1281
2 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
3 Section 1. KRS 157.360 is amended to read as follows:
4 (1) (a) In determining the cost of the program to support education excellence in
5 Kentucky, the statewide guaranteed base funding level, as defined in KRS
6 157.320, shall be computed by dividing the amount appropriated for this
7 purpose by the prior year's statewide average daily attendance.
8 (b) When determining the biennial appropriations for the program, the average
9 daily attendance for each fiscal year shall include an estimate of the number
10 of students graduating early under the provisions of KRS 158.142.
11 (2) Each district shall receive an amount equal to the base funding level for each pupil
12 in average daily attendance in the district in the previous year, except a district shall
13 receive an amount equal to one-half (1/2) of the state portion of the average
14 statewide per pupil guaranteed base funding level for each student who graduated
15 early under the provisions of KRS 158.142. Each district's base funding level shall
16 be adjusted by the following factors:
17 (a) The number of at-risk students in the district. At-risk students shall be
18 identified as those approved for the free lunch program under state and federal
19 guidelines. The number of at-risk students shall be multiplied by a factor to be
20 established by the General Assembly. Funds generated under this paragraph
21 may be used to pay for:
22 1. Alternative programs for students who are at risk of dropping out of
23 school before achieving a diploma; and
24 2. A hazardous duty pay supplement as determined by the local board of
25 education to the teachers who work in alternative programs with
26 students who are violent or assaultive;
27 (b) The number and types of exceptional children in the district as defined by
Page 1 of 16
XXXX 2/12/2025 1:31 PM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1281
1 KRS 157.200. Specific weights for each category of exceptionality shall be
2 used in the calculation of the add-on factor for exceptional children;[ and]
3 (c) Beginning with the 2026-2027 school year, the number of children
4 identified as English language learners in the district. The number of
5 English language learners shall be multiplied by a factor of twenty-four
6 one-hundredths (0.24); and
7 (d) Transportation costs. The per-pupil cost of transportation shall be calculated
8 as provided by KRS 157.370. Districts which contract to furnish
9 transportation to students attending nonpublic schools may adopt any payment
10 formula which ensures that no public school funds are used for the
11 transportation of nonpublic students.
12 (3) Beginning with the 2015-2016 school year and each year thereafter, the General
13 Assembly shall annually allocate funds equal to one-half (1/2) of the state portion
14 of the average statewide per pupil guaranteed base funding level for each student
15 who graduated early under the provisions of KRS 158.142 the previous school year
16 to the Kentucky Higher Education Assistance Authority for deposit in the early
17 graduation scholarship trust fund.
18 (4) The program to support education excellence in Kentucky shall be fully
19 implemented by the 1994-95 school year.
20 (5) (a) Except for those schools which have implemented school-based decision
21 making, the commissioner of education shall enforce maximum class sizes for
22 every academic course requirement in all grades except in vocal and
23 instrumental music, and physical education classes. Except as provided in
24 subsection (6) of this section, the maximum number of pupils enrolled in a
25 class shall be as follows:
26 1. Twenty-four (24) in primary grades (kindergarten through third grade);
27 2. Twenty-eight (28) in grade four (4);
Page 2 of 16
XXXX 2/12/2025 1:31 PM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1281
1 3. Twenty-nine (29) in grades five (5) and six (6);
2 4. Thirty-one (31) in grades seven (7) to twelve (12).
3 (b) Except for those schools which have implemented school-based decision
4 making, class size loads for middle and secondary school classroom teachers
5 shall not exceed the equivalent of one hundred fifty (150) pupil hours per day.
6 (c) The commissioner of education, upon approval of the Kentucky Board of
7 Education, shall adopt administrative regulations for enforcing this provision.
8 These administrative regulations shall include procedures for a superintendent
9 to request an exemption from the Kentucky Board of Education when unusual
10 circumstances warrant an increased class size for an individual class. A
11 request for an exemption shall include specific reasons for the increased class
12 size with a plan for reducing the class size prior to the beginning of the next
13 school year. A district shall not receive in any one (1) year exemptions for
14 more classes than enroll twenty percent (20%) of the pupils in the primary
15 grades and grades four (4) through eight (8).
16 (d) In all schools the commissioner of education shall enforce the special
17 education maximum class sizes set by administrative regulations adopted by
18 the Kentucky Board of Education. A superintendent may request an
19 exemption pursuant to paragraph (c) of this subsection. A local school council
20 may request a waiver pursuant to KRS 156.160(2). An exemption or waiver
21 shall not be granted if the increased class size will impede any exceptional
22 child from achieving his or her individual education program in the least
23 restrictive environment.
24 (6) In grades four (4) through six (6) with combined grades, the maximum class size
25 shall be the average daily attendance upon which funding is appropriated for the
26 lowest assigned grade in the class. There shall be no exceptions to the maximum
27 class size for combined classes. In combined classes other than the primary grades,
Page 3 of 16
XXXX 2/12/2025 1:31 PM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1281
1 no ungraded students shall be placed in a combined class with graded students. In
2 addition, there shall be no more than two (2) consecutive grade levels combined in
3 any one (1) class in grades four (4) through six (6). However, this shall not apply to
4 schools which have implemented school-based decision making.
5 (7) If a local school district, through its admission and release committee, determines
6 that an appropriate program in the least restrictive environment for a particular child
7 with a disability includes either part-time or full-time enrollment with a private
8 school or agency within the state or a public or private agency in another state, the
9 school district shall count as average daily attendance in a public school the time
10 that the child is in attendance at the school or agency, contingent upon approval by
11 the commissioner of education.
12 (8) Pupils attending a center for child learning and study established under an
13 agreement pursuant to KRS 65.210 to 65.300 shall, for the purpose of calculating
14 average daily attendance, be considered as in attendance in the school district in
15 which the child legally resides and which is party to the agreement. For purposes of
16 subsection (1) of this section, teachers who are actually employees of the joint or
17 cooperative action shall be considered as employees of each school district which is
18 a party to the agreement.
19 (9) Program funding shall be increased when the average daily attendance in any
20 district for the first two (2) months of the current school year is greater than the
21 average daily attendance of the district for the first two (2) months of the previous
22 school year. The program funds allotted the district shall be increased by the
23 percent of increase. The average daily attendance in kindergarten is the
24 kindergarten full-time equivalent pupils in average daily attendance.
25 (10) If the average daily attendance for the current school year in any district decreases
26 by ten percent (10%) or more than the average daily attendance for the previous
27 school year, the average daily attendance for purposes of calculating program
Page 4 of 16
XXXX 2/12/2025 1:31 PM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1281
1 funding for the next school year shall be increased by an amount equal to two-thirds
2 (2/3) of the decrease in average daily attendance. If the average daily attendance
3 remains the same or decreases in the succeeding school year, the average daily
4 attendance for purposes of calculating program funding for the following school
5 year shall be increased by an amount equal to one-third (1/3) of the decrease for the
6 first year of the decline.
7 (11) If the percentage of attendance of any school district shall have been reduced more
8 than two percent (2%) during the previous school year, the program funding
9 allotted the district for the current school year shall be increased by the difference in
10 the percentage of attendance for the two (2) years immediately prior to the current
11 school year less two percent (2%).
12 (12) (a) Instructional salaries for vocational agriculture classes shall be for twelve (12)
13 months per year. Vocational agriculture teachers shall be responsible for the
14 following program of instruction during the time period beyond the regular
15 school term established by the local board of education: supervision and
16 instruction of students in agriculture experience programs; group and
17 individual instruction of farmers and agribusinessmen; supervision of student
18 members of agricultural organizations who are involved in leadership training
19 or other activity required by state or federal law; or any program of vocational
20 agriculture established by the Department of Education. During extended
21 employment, no vocational agriculture teacher shall receive salary on a day
22 that the teacher is scheduled to attend an institution of higher education class
23 which could be credited toward meeting any certification requirement.
24 (b) Each teacher of agriculture employed shall submit an annual plan for summer
25 program to the local school superintendent for approval. The summer plan
26 shall include a list of tasks to be performed, purposes for each task, and time
27 to be spent on each task. Approval by the local school superintendent shall be

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1281
1 in compliance with the guidelines developed by the Department of Education.
2 The supervision and accountability of teachers of vocational agriculture's
3 summer programs shall be the responsibility of the local school
4 superintendent. The local school superintendent shall submit to the
5 commissioner of education a completed report of summer tasks for each
6 vocational agriculture teacher. Twenty percent (20%) of the approved
7 vocational agriculture programs shall be audited annually by the State
8 Department of Education to determine that the summer plan has been properly
9 executed.
10 (13) (a) In allotting program funds for home and hospital instruction, statewide
11 guaranteed base funding, excluding the capital outlay, shall be allotted for
12 each child in average daily attendance in the prior school year who has been
13 properly identified according to Kentucky Board of Education administrative
14 regulations. Attendance shall be calculated pursuant to KRS 157.270 and shall
15 be reported monthly on forms provided by the Department of Education; and
16 (b) Pursuant to administrative regulations of the Kentucky Board of Education,
17 local school districts shall be reimbursed for home and hospital instruction for
18 pupils unable to attend regular school sessions because of short-term health
19 impairments. A reimbursement formula shall be established by administrative
20 regulations to include such factors as a reasonable per hour, per child
21 allotment for teacher instructional time, with a maximum number of funded
22 hours per week, a reasonable allotment for teaching supplies and equipment,
23 and a reasonable allotment for travel expenses to and from instructional
24 assignments, but the formula shall not include an allotment for capital outlay.
25 Attendance shall be calculated pursuant to KRS 157.270 and shall be reported
26 annually on forms provided by the Department of Education.
27 (14) Except for those schools which have implemented school-based decision making
Page 6 of 16
XXXX 2/12/2025 1:31 PM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1281
1 and the school council has voted to waive this subsection, kindergarten aides shall
2 be provided for each twenty-four (24) full-time equivalent kindergarten students
3 enrolled.
4 (15) Effective July 1, 2001, there shall be no deduction applied against the base funding
5 level for any pupil in average daily attendance who spends a portion of his or her
6 school day in a program at a state-operated career and technical education or
7 vocational facility.
8 (16) During a fiscal year, a school district may request that the Department of Education
9 recalculate its funds allocated under this section if the current year average daily
10 attendance for the twenty (20) day school month as defined in KRS 158.060(1) that
11 contains the most days within the calendar month of January exceeds the prior year
12 adjusted average daily attendance plus growth by at least one percent (1%). Any
13 adjustments in the allotments approved under this subsection shall be proportional
14 to the remaining days in the school year and subject to available funds under the
15 program to support education excellence in Kentucky.
16 (17) To calculate the state portion of the program to support education excellence in
17 Kentucky for a school district, the Department of Education shall subtract the local
18 effort required under KRS 157.390(5) from the calculated base funding under the
19 program to support education excellence in Kentucky, as required by this section.
20 The value of the real estate used in this calculation shall be the lesser of the current
21 year assessment or the prior year assessment increased by four percent (4%) plus
22 the value of current year new property. The calculation under this subsection shall
23 be subject to available funds.
24 (18) Notwithstanding any other statute or budget of the Commonwealth language to the
25 contrary, time missed due to shortening days for emergencies may be made up by
26 lengthening school days in the school calendar without any loss of funds under the
27 program to support education excellence in Kentucky.

18 petition to Circuit Court of the county in which the public charter school is located
19 to prioritize the distribution of assets.
20 (16) The state board shall promulgate administrative regulations to:
21 (a) Establish the process to be used to evaluate the performance of a charter
22 school authorizer, based upon the requirements of KRS 160.1590 to 160.1599

1 AN ACT relating to English language learners.
2 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
3 Section 1. KRS 157.360 is amended to read as follows:
4 (1) (a) In determining the cost of the program to support education excellence in
5 Kentucky, the statewide guaranteed base funding level, as defined in KRS
6 157.320, shall be computed by dividing the amount appropriated for this
7 purpose by the prior year's statewide average daily attendance.
8 (b) When determining the biennial appropriations for the program, the average
9 daily attendance for each fiscal year shall include an estimate of the number
10 of students graduating early under the provisions of KRS 158.142.
11 (2) Each district shall receive an amount equal to the base funding level for each pupil
12 in average daily attendance in the district in the previous year, except a district shall
13 receive an amount equal to one-half (1/2) of the state portion of the average
14 statewide per pupil guaranteed base funding level for each student who graduated
15 early under the provisions of KRS 158.142. Each district's base funding level shall
16 be adjusted by the following factors:
17 (a) The number of at-risk students in the district. At-risk students shall be
18 identified as those approved for the free lunch program under state and federal
19 guidelines. The number of at-risk students shall be multiplied by a factor to be
20 established by the General Assembly. Funds generated under this paragraph
21 may be used to pay for:
22 1. Alternative programs for students who are at risk of dropping out of
23 school before achieving a diploma; and
24 2. A hazardous duty pay supplement as determined by the local board of
25 education to the teachers who work in alternative programs with
26 students who are violent or assaultive;
27 (b) The number and types of exceptional children in the district as defined by
Page 1 of 16
XXXX 2/12/2025 1:31 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1281
1 KRS 157.200. Specific weights for each category of exceptionality shall be
2 used in the calculation of the add-on factor for exceptional children;[ and]
3 (c) Beginning with the 2026-2027 school year, the number of children
4 identified as English language learners in the district. The number of
5 English language learners shall be multiplied by a factor of twenty-four
6 one-hundredths (0.24); and
7 (d) Transportation costs. The per-pupil cost of transportation shall be calculated
8 as provided by KRS 157.370. Districts which contract to furnish
9 transportation to students attending nonpublic schools may adopt any payment
10 formula which ensures that no public school funds are used for the
11 transportation of nonpublic students.
12 (3) Beginning with the 2015-2016 school year and each year thereafter, the General
13 Assembly shall annually allocate funds equal to one-half (1/2) of the state portion
14 of the average statewide per pupil guaranteed base funding level for each student
15 who graduated early under the provisions of KRS 158.142 the previous school year
16 to the Kentucky Higher Education Assistance Authority for deposit in the early
17 graduation scholarship trust fund.
18 (4) The program to support education excellence in Kentucky shall be fully
19 implemented by the 1994-95 school year.
20 (5) (a) Except for those schools which have implemented school-based decision
21 making, the commissioner of education shall enforce maximum class sizes for
22 every academic course requirement in all grades except in vocal and
23 instrumental music, and physical education classes. Except as provided in
24 subsection (6) of this section, the maximum number of pupils enrolled in a
25 class shall be as follows:
26 1. Twenty-four (24) in primary grades (kindergarten through third grade);
27 2. Twenty-eight (28) in grade four (4);
Page 2 of 16
XXXX 2/12/2025 1:31 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1281
1 3. Twenty-nine (29) in grades five (5) and six (6);
2 4. Thirty-one (31) in grades seven (7) to twelve (12).
3 (b) Except for those schools which have implemented school-based decision
4 making, class size loads for middle and secondary school classroom teachers
5 shall not exceed the equivalent of one hundred fifty (150) pupil hours per day.
6 (c) The commissioner of education, upon approval of the Kentucky Board of
7 Education, shall adopt administrative regulations for enforcing this provision.
8 These administrative regulations shall include procedures for a superintendent
9 to request an exemption from the Kentucky Board of Education when unusual
10 circumstances warrant an increased class size for an individual class. A
11 request for an exemption shall include specific reasons for the increased class
12 size with a plan for reducing the class size prior to the beginning of the next
13 school year. A district shall not receive in any one (1) year exemptions for
14 more classes than enroll twenty percent (20%) of the pupils in the primary
15 grades and grades four (4) through eight (8).
16 (d) In all schools the commissioner of education shall enforce the special
17 education maximum class sizes set by administrative regulations adopted by
18 the Kentucky Board of Education. A superintendent may request an
19 exemption pursuant to paragraph (c) of this subsection. A local school council
20 may request a waiver pursuant to KRS 156.160(2). An exemption or waiver
21 shall not be granted if the increased class size will impede any exceptional
22 child from achieving his or her individual education program in the least
23 restrictive environment.
24 (6) In grades four (4) through six (6) with combined grades, the maximum class size
25 shall be the average daily attendance upon which funding is appropriated for the
26 lowest assigned grade in the class. There shall be no exceptions to the maximum
27 class size for combined classes. In combined classes other than the primary grades,
Page 3 of 16
XXXX 2/12/2025 1:31 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1281
1 no ungraded students shall be placed in a combined class with graded students. In
2 addition, there shall be no more than two (2) consecutive grade levels combined in
3 any one (1) class in grades four (4) through six (6). However, this shall not apply to
4 schools which have implemented school-based decision making.
5 (7) If a local school district, through its admission and release committee, determines
6 that an appropriate program in the least restrictive environment for a particular child
7 with a disability includes either part-time or full-time enrollment with a private
8 school or agency within the state or a public or private agency in another state, the
9 school district shall count as average daily attendance in a public school the time
10 that the child is in attendance at the school or agency, contingent upon approval by
11 the commissioner of education.
12 (8) Pupils attending a center for child learning and study established under an
13 agreement pursuant to KRS 65.210 to 65.300 shall, for the purpose of calculating
14 average daily attendance, be considered as in attendance in the school district in
15 which the child legally resides and which is party to the agreement. For purposes of
16 subsection (1) of this section, teachers who are actually employees of the joint or
17 cooperative action shall be considered as employees of each school district which is
18 a party to the agreement.
19 (9) Program funding shall be increased when the average daily attendance in any
20 district for the first two (2) months of the current school year is greater than the
21 average daily attendance of the district for the first two (2) months of the previous
22 school year. The program funds allotted the district shall be increased by the
23 percent of increase. The average daily attendance in kindergarten is the
24 kindergarten full-time equivalent pupils in average daily attendance.
25 (10) If the average daily attendance for the current school year in any district decreases
26 by ten percent (10%) or more than the average daily attendance for the previous
27 school year, the average daily attendance for purposes of calculating program
Page 4 of 16
XXXX 2/12/2025 1:31 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1281
1 funding for the next school year shall be increased by an amount equal to two-thirds
2 (2/3) of the decrease in average daily attendance. If the average daily attendance
3 remains the same or decreases in the succeeding school year, the average daily
4 attendance for purposes of calculating program funding for the following school
5 year shall be increased by an amount equal to one-third (1/3) of the decrease for the
6 first year of the decline.
7 (11) If the percentage of attendance of any school district shall have been reduced more
8 than two percent (2%) during the previous school year, the program funding
9 allotted the district for the current school year shall be increased by the difference in
10 the percentage of attendance for the two (2) years immediately prior to the current
11 school year less two percent (2%).
12 (12) (a) Instructional salaries for vocational agriculture classes shall be for twelve (12)
13 months per year. Vocational agriculture teachers shall be responsible for the
14 following program of instruction during the time period beyond the regular
15 school term established by the local board of education: supervision and
16 instruction of students in agriculture experience programs; group and
17 individual instruction of farmers and agribusinessmen; supervision of student
18 members of agricultural organizations who are involved in leadership training
19 or other activity required by state or federal law; or any program of vocational
20 agriculture established by the Department of Education. During extended
21 employment, no vocational agriculture teacher shall receive salary on a day
22 that the teacher is scheduled to attend an institution of higher education class
23 which could be credited toward meeting any certification requirement.
24 (b) Each teacher of agriculture employed shall submit an annual plan for summer
25 program to the local school superintendent for approval. The summer plan
26 shall include a list of tasks to be performed, purposes for each task, and time
27 to be spent on each task. Approval by the local school superintendent shall be

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1281
1 in compliance with the guidelines developed by the Department of Education.
2 The supervision and accountability of teachers of vocational agriculture's
3 summer programs shall be the responsibility of the local school
4 superintendent. The local school superintendent shall submit to the
5 commissioner of education a completed report of summer tasks for each
6 vocational agriculture teacher. Twenty percent (20%) of the approved
7 vocational agriculture programs shall be audited annually by the State
8 Department of Education to determine that the summer plan has been properly
9 executed.
10 (13) (a) In allotting program funds for home and hospital instruction, statewide
11 guaranteed base funding, excluding the capital outlay, shall be allotted for
12 each child in average daily attendance in the prior school year who has been
13 properly identified according to Kentucky Board of Education administrative
14 regulations. Attendance shall be calculated pursuant to KRS 157.270 and shall
15 be reported monthly on forms provided by the Department of Education; and
16 (b) Pursuant to administrative regulations of the Kentucky Board of Education,
17 local school districts shall be reimbursed for home and hospital instruction for
18 pupils unable to attend regular school sessions because of short-term health
19 impairments. A reimbursement formula shall be established by administrative
20 regulations to include such factors as a reasonable per hour, per child
21 allotment for teacher instructional time, with a maximum number of funded
22 hours per week, a reasonable allotment for teaching supplies and equipment,
23 and a reasonable allotment for travel expenses to and from instructional
24 assignments, but the formula shall not include an allotment for capital outlay.
25 Attendance shall be calculated pursuant to KRS 157.270 and shall be reported
26 annually on forms provided by the Department of Education.
27 (14) Except for those schools which have implemented school-based decision making
Page 6 of 16
XXXX 2/12/2025 1:31 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1281
1 and the school council has voted to waive this subsection, kindergarten aides shall
2 be provided for each twenty-four (24) full-time equivalent kindergarten students
3 enrolled.
4 (15) Effective July 1, 2001, there shall be no deduction applied against the base funding
5 level for any pupil in average daily attendance who spends a portion of his or her
6 school day in a program at a state-operated career and technical education or
7 vocational facility.
8 (16) During a fiscal year, a school district may request that the Department of Education
9 recalculate its funds allocated under this section if the current year average daily
10 attendance for the twenty (20) day school month as defined in KRS 158.060(1) that
11 contains the most days within the calendar month of January exceeds the prior year
12 adjusted average daily attendance plus growth by at least one percent (1%). Any
13 adjustments in the allotments approved under this subsection shall be proportional
14 to the remaining days in the school year and subject to available funds under the
15 program to support education excellence in Kentucky.
16 (17) To calculate the state portion of the program to support education excellence in
17 Kentucky for a school district, the Department of Education shall subtract the local
18 effort required under KRS 157.390(5) from the calculated base funding under the
19 program to support education excellence in Kentucky, as required by this section.
20 The value of the real estate used in this calculation shall be the lesser of the current
21 year assessment or the prior year assessment increased by four percent (4%) plus
22 the value of current year new property. The calculation under this subsection shall
23 be subject to available funds.
24 (18) Notwithstanding any other statute or budget of the Commonwealth language to the
25 contrary, time missed due to shortening days for emergencies may be made up by
26 lengthening school days in the school calendar without any loss of funds under the
27 program to support education excellence in Kentucky.

10 2. The performance framework shall allow the inclusion of additional
11 rigorous, valid, and reliable indicators proposed by a public charter
12 school to augment external evaluations of its performance. The proposed
13 indicators shall be consistent with the purposes of KRS 160.1590 to
14 160.1599 and 161.141 and shall be negotiated with the authorizer.

25 (f) The charter contract shall be signed by the chair of the governing board of the
26 authorizer and the chair of the board of directors of the public charter school.
27 An approved charter application shall serve as a charter contract for the public

1 charter school.
2 (g) No public charter school may commence operations without a charter contract

4 governing board of the authorizer.
5 (2) Within five (5) days after entering into a charter contract, a copy of the executed
6 contract shall be submitted by the authorizer to the commissioner of education.
7 (3) For the purposes of local and state funding, a public charter school shall serve as a
8 school of the district of location.
9 (4) For the purposes of federal funding, a public charter school shall serve as a local
10 education agency.
11 (5) All students enrolled in a public charter school shall be included in the average
12 daily attendance calculation under KRS 157.360 and the aggregate and average
13 daily attendance of transported pupils calculation under KRS 157.370 of the district
14 of location in the same manner as any other public schools in the district and shall
15 be reported by the public charter schools to the school district and state Department
16 of Education for purposes of calculating the state and local share of funding for
17 each public charter school.
18 (6) Notwithstanding the formula for allocating district funds under KRS 160.345(8)
19 and any other statute governing a district's funding of schools, unless an authorizing
20 district agrees to provide a larger sum of funding in the charter contract, after local
21 capital outlay funds that are restricted in use pursuant to KRS 157.420(4) and funds
22 under KRS 157.440(1)(b) and 157.621 necessary to meet debt service obligations
23 on bonds or other financing mechanisms for new construction and renovation
24 projects for school facilities are excluded, and before any other funds are budgeted

1 public charter school's enrollment and demographics and the district's
2 overall enrollment and demographics.

17 required by KRS 160.1595.
18 (11) Funds identified for transfer by a district of location to a public charter school under
19 this section shall be transferred throughout the school year according to a schedule
20 determined by the state board. The scheduled dates shall be within thirty (30) days
21 of the dates of state disbursement of funds to school districts. Failure to transfer
22 required funds shall, for every five (5) days late, result in a fine to the violator of
23 not less than five percent (5%) of the total funds per funding period to be
24 transferred. Fines imposed shall be transferred to the public charter school affected
25 by the delay.
26 (12) A public charter school shall be eligible for federal and state competitive grants and

3 receive such aid.
4 (13) A public charter school shall receive a proportionate per pupil share of any state
5 moneys not otherwise identified in this section that is received by the school district

9 school that receives such aid shall comply with all requirements to receive such aid.
10 (14) The commissioner of education shall apply for all federal funding that supports
11 charter school initiatives for which a state must be the applicant and shall cooperate
12 with any public charter school in its efforts to seek federal funding.
13 (15) If a public charter school closes for any reason, the assets of the school shall be
14 distributed first to satisfy outstanding payroll obligations for employees of the
15 school, then to the creditors of the school, then to the district of location or
16 authorizing districts if authorized by a collaborative of local boards of education. If
17 the assets are insufficient to satisfy outstanding obligations, the authorizer shall
18 petition to Circuit Court of the county in which the public charter school is located
19 to prioritize the distribution of assets.
20 (16) The state board shall promulgate administrative regulations to:
21 (a) Establish the process to be used to evaluate the performance of a charter
22 school authorizer, based upon the requirements of KRS 160.1590 to 160.1599
23 and 161.141, and the actions to be taken in response to failures in
24 performance; and
25 (b) Govern the calculation and distribution of funds due to public charter schools
