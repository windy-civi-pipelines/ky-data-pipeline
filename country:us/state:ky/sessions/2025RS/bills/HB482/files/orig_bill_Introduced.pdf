1 (a) Increasing the retention and progression of students toward timely credential
2 or degree completion;
3 (b) Increasing the number and types of credentials and degrees earned by all types

1 Postsecondary Education. The funding model shall include a public university
2 sector formula and a KCTCS sector formula, and shall not include any race-based
3 metrics or targets in the formulas.
4 (5) The funding formula for the public university sector shall:
5 (a) Recognize differences in missions and cost structures between research
6 universities and comprehensive universities to ensure that neither are

10 success, course completion, and operational support components, regardless
11 of whether state funding for postsecondary institution operations increases,
12 decreases, or remains stable;
13 (c) Include an adjustment to minimize impact on smaller campuses as determined
14 by the council; and
15 (d) Be constructed to achieve equilibrium, at which point the funding formula
16 rewards rates of improvement above the sector average rate.
17 (6) Funding for the public university sector shall be distributed as follows:

5 division baccalaureate, master's, doctoral research, doctoral professional, and
6 nontraditional age students; and
7 (c) Thirty percent (30%) of total university allocable resources shall be
8 distributed in support of vital campus operations as follows:
9 1. Ten percent (10%) shall be distributed based on each university's share
10 of Category I and Category II square feet, net of research, nonclass

13 as determined by the council in collaboration with the working group
14 established in subsection (11) of this section;
15 2. Ten percent (10%) shall be distributed based on each university's share
16 of total instruction and student services spending, net of maintenance

6 be distributed based on each college's share of total student success outcomes

7 1. A hold-harmless provision for fiscal year 2018-2019 preventing a
8 reduction in an institution's funding amount based solely on the formula

20 funding to any institution to two percent (2%) of that institution's
21 formula base amount; and
22 5. A stop-loss provision for fiscal year 2021-2022, and every fiscal year
23 thereafter, limiting the reduction in funding to any institution to zero
24 percent (0%) of that institution's formula base amount.
25 (b) Paragraph (a) of this subsection shall not be construed to limit the level of a

1 5. The President of the Senate or designee.
2 (b) Beginning in fiscal year 2020-2021 and every three (3) fiscal years thereafter,
3 the postsecondary education working group shall convene to determine if the
4 comprehensive funding model is functioning as expected, identify any
5 unintended consequences of the model, and recommend any adjustments to
6 the model. The council may call the working group to convene prior to the
7 start of the required fiscal year to allow sufficient time for the group to
8 complete its work.
9 (c) The results of the review and recommendations of the working group shall be

17 postsecondary institutions and achievement of the Commonwealth's education
18 policy goals and workforce development priorities. General fund moneys may
19 be appropriated by the General Assembly to this fund for distribution to the
20 public postsecondary institutions in amounts determined through the
21 comprehensive funding model created in this section.
22 (b) Any balance in the performance fund at the close of any fiscal year shall not
23 lapse but shall be carried forward to the next fiscal year and be continuously
24 appropriated for the purposes specified in this section. A general statement
25 that all continuing appropriations are repealed, discontinued, or suspended
26 shall not operate to repeal, discontinue, or suspend this fund or to repeal this
27 action.
