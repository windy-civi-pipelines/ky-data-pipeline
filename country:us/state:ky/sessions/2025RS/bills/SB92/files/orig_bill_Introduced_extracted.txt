4 after notification or if he or she renounces his or her claim to the property, the
5 property shall be disposed of as provided in this section.
6 (c) It shall be the duty of all peace officers and other public officers or officials
7 having knowledge of the lawful owner or claimant of property subject to

1 record when the trial court elects to dispose of the property pursuant to
2 subsection (1)(b) of this section.
3 (5) For purposes of this section, "lawful claimant" means owner or lienholder of record.
4 (6) (a) Before property which has had its identity obscured in violation of KRS
5 514.120 may be sold or retained for official use as provided in this section, the
6 court shall cause a serial or other identifying number to be placed thereon, and
7 a record of the number assigned shall be placed in the court order authorizing

10 any other state or federal regulatory agency.
11 (b) The purchaser of the property shall be given a document stating that the
12 property had been forfeited pursuant to law and that a number, shown on the

14 owner with KRS 514.120. When property is returned to an owner pursuant to
15 this section and its identity has been obscured by another person in violation
16 of KRS 514.120, the court shall provide a document to the owner relieving
17 him or her of liability for its continued possession. This document shall serve

26 or is identifiable, the court shall notify the owner or claimant that the property
27 is being held and specify a reasonable period of time during which the claim

1 may be made or may, in lieu thereof, order the return of the property to the
2 lawful owner or claimant.
3 (b) If the lawful owner or claimant does not assert his or her claim to the property
4 after notification or if he or she renounces his or her claim to the property, the
5 property shall be disposed of as provided in this section.
6 (c) It shall be the duty of all peace officers and other public officers or officials
7 having knowledge of the lawful owner or claimant of property subject to
8 forfeiture to report the same to the trial court before the act of forfeiture
9 occurs.
