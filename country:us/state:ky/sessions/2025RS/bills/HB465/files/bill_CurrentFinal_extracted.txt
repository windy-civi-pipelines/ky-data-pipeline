Page 6 of 8
HB046510.100 - 1493 - XXXX 3/5/2025 4:32 PM GA
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS HB 465/GA
1 criminal use or to money forfeited under subsection (2) of this section.

4 section;
5 (b) Establishes his or her legal interest in the property; and
6 (c) Establishes that the unlawful use of the property was without his or her

13 cause a serial or other identifying number to be placed thereon, and a record of the
14 number assigned shall be placed in the court order authorizing the sale or retention
15 of the property. This number shall be assigned, whenever applicable, in consultation
16 with the Department of Kentucky State Police and any other state or federal
17 regulatory agency. The purchaser of the property shall be given a document stating
18 that the property had been forfeited pursuant to law and that a number, shown on
19 the document, has been assigned which shall be deemed as compliance of the owner
20 with KRS 514.120. When property is returned to an owner pursuant to this section
21 and its identity has been obscured by another person in violation of KRS 514.120,
22 the court shall provide a document to the owner relieving him or her of liability for
23 its continued possession. This document shall serve as evidence of compliance with
24 KRS 514.120 by the owner or any person to whom he or she lawfully disposes of
25 the property. This section shall not apply to any person after property has been sold
26 or returned in compliance with this section who violates the provisions of KRS

1 (7) Before forfeiture of any property under this section, it shall be the duty of the trial
2 court to determine if a lawful owner or claimant to the property has been identified
3 or is identifiable. If a lawful owner or claimant has been identified or is identifiable,
4 the court shall notify the owner or claimant that the property is being held and
5 specify a reasonable period of time during which the claim may be made or may, in
6 lieu thereof, order the return of the property to the lawful owner or claimant. If the
7 lawful owner or claimant does not assert his or her claim to the property after
8 notification or if he or she renounces his or her claim to the property, the property
9 shall be disposed of as provided in this section. It shall be the duty of all peace
10 officers and other public officers or officials having knowledge of the lawful owner
11 or claimant of property subject to forfeiture to report the same to the trial court
12 before the act of forfeiture occurs.

6 (d) If property which is forfeited under any section of this code is determined by
7 the trial court to be worthless, encumbered with liens in excess of its value, or
8 otherwise a burdensome asset, the court may abandon any interest in such
9 property. Property which is abandoned pursuant to this section shall be
10 returned to the lawful claimant upon payment of expenses for keeping the
11 property.

1 criminal use or to money forfeited under subsection (2) of this section.

3 (a) Asserts his or her claim before disposition of the property pursuant to this
4 section;
5 (b) Establishes his or her legal interest in the property; and
6 (c) Establishes that the unlawful use of the property was without his or her
7 knowledge and consent. This subsection shall not apply to a lienholder of
8 record when the trial court elects to dispose of the property pursuant to
9 subsection (1)(b) of this section.
10 (5) For purposes of this section, "lawful claimant" means owner or lienholder of record.
11 (6) Before property which has had its identity obscured in violation of KRS 514.120
12 may be sold or retained for official use as provided in this section, the court shall
13 cause a serial or other identifying number to be placed thereon, and a record of the
14 number assigned shall be placed in the court order authorizing the sale or retention
15 of the property. This number shall be assigned, whenever applicable, in consultation
16 with the Department of Kentucky State Police and any other state or federal
17 regulatory agency. The purchaser of the property shall be given a document stating
18 that the property had been forfeited pursuant to law and that a number, shown on
19 the document, has been assigned which shall be deemed as compliance of the owner
20 with KRS 514.120. When property is returned to an owner pursuant to this section
21 and its identity has been obscured by another person in violation of KRS 514.120,
22 the court shall provide a document to the owner relieving him or her of liability for
23 its continued possession. This document shall serve as evidence of compliance with
24 KRS 514.120 by the owner or any person to whom he or she lawfully disposes of
25 the property. This section shall not apply to any person after property has been sold
26 or returned in compliance with this section who violates the provisions of KRS
27 514.120 with respect to that property.

1 (7) Before forfeiture of any property under this section, it shall be the duty of the trial

4 the court shall notify the owner or claimant that the property is being held and
5 specify a reasonable period of time during which the claim may be made or may, in
6 lieu thereof, order the return of the property to the lawful owner or claimant. If the
7 lawful owner or claimant does not assert his or her claim to the property after
8 notification or if he or she renounces his or her claim to the property, the property
9 shall be disposed of as provided in this section. It shall be the duty of all peace
10 officers and other public officers or officials having knowledge of the lawful owner
11 or claimant of property subject to forfeiture to report the same to the trial court
12 before the act of forfeiture occurs.
