18 supplement to classroom instruction throughout the Commonwealth and for

20 initial term commencing with the date of the lease and ending with the next
21 ensuing June 30, which is the close of the then-current fiscal biennium of the
22 Commonwealth, with exclusive options in favor of the board to renew the
23 same for successive ensuing bienniums, July 1 in each even year to June 30 in
24 the next ensuing even year; and the rentals may be fixed at the sums in each
25 biennium, if renewed, sufficient to enable the State Property and Buildings
26 Commission to pay therefrom the maturing principal of and interest on, and

Page 7 of 10

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1012
1 Buildings Commission may determine to be necessary and sufficient, in
2 agreement with the board, to provide the cost of acquiring the television and
3 related facilities with appurtenances and costs as may be incident to the
4 issuance of the bonds.
5 (b) Each option of the Kentucky Board of Education to renew the lease for a
6 succeeding biennial term may be exercised at any time after the adjournment
7 of the session of the General Assembly at which appropriations shall have
8 been made for the operation of the state government for such succeeding
9 biennial term, by notifying the State Property and Buildings Commission in
10 writing, signed by the chief state school officer, and delivered to the secretary
11 of the Finance and Administration Cabinet as a member of the commission.
12 The option shall be deemed automatically exercised, and the lease
13 automatically renewed for the succeeding biennium, effective on the first day
14 thereof, unless a written notice of the board's election not to renew shall have
15 been delivered in the office of the secretary of the Finance and Administration
16 Cabinet before the close of business on the last working day in April
17 immediately preceding the beginning of the succeeding biennium.
18 (c) The Kentucky Board of Education shall not itself operate leased television
19 facilities, or undertake the preparation of the educational presentations or
20 films to be transmitted thereby, but may enter into one (1) or more contracts
21 to provide therefor, with any public agency and instrumentality of the
22 Commonwealth having, or able to provide, a staff with proper technical
23 qualifications, upon which agency and instrumentality the board, through the
24 chief state school officer and the Department of Education, is represented in
25 such manner as to coordinate matters of curriculum with the curricula
26 prescribed for the public schools of the Commonwealth. Any contract for the
27 operation of the leased television or related facilities may permit limited and
Page 8 of 10

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1012
1 special uses of the television or related facilities for other programs in the
2 public interest, subject to the reasonable terms and conditions as the board and
3 the operating agency and instrumentality may agree upon; but any contract
4 shall affirmatively forbid the use of the television or related facilities, at any
5 time or in any manner, in the dissemination of political propaganda or in
6 furtherance of the interest of any political party or candidate for public office,
7 or for commercial advertising. No lease between the board and the State
8 Property and Buildings Commission shall bind the board to pay rentals for
9 more than one (1) fiscal biennium at a time, subject to the aforesaid renewal
10 options. The board may receive and may apply to rental payments under any
11 lease and to the cost of providing for the operation of the television or related
12 facilities not only appropriations which may be made to it from state funds,
13 from time to time, but also contributions, gifts, matching funds, devises, and
14 bequests from any source, whether federal or state, and whether public or
15 private, so long as the same are not conditioned upon any improper use of the
16 television or related facilities in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of
17 this subsection.
18 (4) The state board may, on the recommendation and with the advice of the chief state
19 school officer, prescribe, print, publish, and distribute at public expense such
20 administrative regulations, courses of study, curriculums, bulletins, programs,
21 outlines, reports, and placards as each deems necessary for the efficient
22 management, control, and operation of the schools and programs under its
23 jurisdiction. All administrative regulations published or distributed by the board
24 shall be enclosed in a booklet or binder on which the words "informational copy"
25 shall be clearly stamped or printed.
26 (5) Upon the recommendation of the chief state school officer or his or her designee,
27 the state board shall establish policy or act on all matters relating to programs,

15 Property and Buildings Commission or others, whether public or private, any
16 lands, buildings, structures, installations, and facilities suitable for use in
17 establishing and furthering television and related facilities as an aid or
18 supplement to classroom instruction throughout the Commonwealth and for
19 incidental use in any other proper public functions. The lease may be for any
20 initial term commencing with the date of the lease and ending with the next
21 ensuing June 30, which is the close of the then-current fiscal biennium of the
22 Commonwealth, with exclusive options in favor of the board to renew the
23 same for successive ensuing bienniums, July 1 in each even year to June 30 in
24 the next ensuing even year; and the rentals may be fixed at the sums in each
25 biennium, if renewed, sufficient to enable the State Property and Buildings
26 Commission to pay therefrom the maturing principal of and interest on, and
27 provide reserves for, any revenue bonds which the State Property and
Page 7 of 10

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1012
1 Buildings Commission may determine to be necessary and sufficient, in
2 agreement with the board, to provide the cost of acquiring the television and
3 related facilities with appurtenances and costs as may be incident to the
4 issuance of the bonds.
5 (b) Each option of the Kentucky Board of Education to renew the lease for a
6 succeeding biennial term may be exercised at any time after the adjournment
7 of the session of the General Assembly at which appropriations shall have
8 been made for the operation of the state government for such succeeding
9 biennial term, by notifying the State Property and Buildings Commission in
10 writing, signed by the chief state school officer, and delivered to the secretary
11 of the Finance and Administration Cabinet as a member of the commission.
12 The option shall be deemed automatically exercised, and the lease
13 automatically renewed for the succeeding biennium, effective on the first day
14 thereof, unless a written notice of the board's election not to renew shall have
15 been delivered in the office of the secretary of the Finance and Administration
16 Cabinet before the close of business on the last working day in April
17 immediately preceding the beginning of the succeeding biennium.
18 (c) The Kentucky Board of Education shall not itself operate leased television
19 facilities, or undertake the preparation of the educational presentations or
20 films to be transmitted thereby, but may enter into one (1) or more contracts
21 to provide therefor, with any public agency and instrumentality of the
22 Commonwealth having, or able to provide, a staff with proper technical
23 qualifications, upon which agency and instrumentality the board, through the
24 chief state school officer and the Department of Education, is represented in
25 such manner as to coordinate matters of curriculum with the curricula
26 prescribed for the public schools of the Commonwealth. Any contract for the
27 operation of the leased television or related facilities may permit limited and
Page 8 of 10
XXXX 1/24/2025 2:52 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1012
1 special uses of the television or related facilities for other programs in the
2 public interest, subject to the reasonable terms and conditions as the board and
3 the operating agency and instrumentality may agree upon; but any contract
4 shall affirmatively forbid the use of the television or related facilities, at any
5 time or in any manner, in the dissemination of political propaganda or in
6 furtherance of the interest of any political party or candidate for public office,
7 or for commercial advertising. No lease between the board and the State
8 Property and Buildings Commission shall bind the board to pay rentals for
9 more than one (1) fiscal biennium at a time, subject to the aforesaid renewal
10 options. The board may receive and may apply to rental payments under any
11 lease and to the cost of providing for the operation of the television or related
12 facilities not only appropriations which may be made to it from state funds,
13 from time to time, but also contributions, gifts, matching funds, devises, and
14 bequests from any source, whether federal or state, and whether public or
15 private, so long as the same are not conditioned upon any improper use of the
16 television or related facilities in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of
17 this subsection.
18 (4) The state board may, on the recommendation and with the advice of the chief state
19 school officer, prescribe, print, publish, and distribute at public expense such
20 administrative regulations, courses of study, curriculums, bulletins, programs,
21 outlines, reports, and placards as each deems necessary for the efficient
22 management, control, and operation of the schools and programs under its
23 jurisdiction. All administrative regulations published or distributed by the board
24 shall be enclosed in a booklet or binder on which the words "informational copy"
25 shall be clearly stamped or printed.
26 (5) Upon the recommendation of the chief state school officer or his or her designee,
27 the state board shall establish policy or act on all matters relating to programs,
