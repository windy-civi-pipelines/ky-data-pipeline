2 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
3 Section 1. KRS 161.030 is amended to read as follows:
4 (1) Notwithstanding the age of the pupil, the certification of all teachers and other
5 school personnel, in public schools only, is vested in the Education Professional
6 Standards Board. When so certified, teachers and other school personnel shall not
7 be required to have licensure, certification, or other forms of approval from any
8 other state agency for the performance of their respective assignments within the
9 system of public schools, except as provided for by law. All certificates authorized
10 under KRS 161.010 to 161.126 shall be issued in accordance with the
11 administrative regulations of the Education Professional Standards Board.[ After
12 July 15, 1994,] All certificate applications and other data collection instruments of
13 the board shall include a request for voluntary information about the applicant's
14 ethnic background. This information shall be available to help local school districts
15 locate minority candidates. A person who holds a certificate prior to this
16 requirement may request that ethnic information be added to his or her file. Nothing
17 in this section shall preclude the right of an individual in a nonpublic school from
18 seeking voluntary certification by the Education Professional Standards Board.
19 (2) Certificates shall be issued upon written application and in accordance with statutes
20 and regulations in effect at the time of application to persons who have completed,
21 at colleges, universities, or local school district programs approved by the
22 Education Professional Standards Board for the preparation of teachers and other
23 school personnel, the curricula prescribed by the administrative regulations of the
24 Education Professional Standards Board.
25 (3) [(a) ]Certification of all new teachers and teachers seeking additional certification
26 shall require the successful completion of appropriate and approved teacher

1 selected by the Education Professional Standards Board and shall measure
2 knowledge in the specific teaching field of the applicant, including content of the
3 field and teaching of that content. The Education Professional Standards Board
4 shall determine the minimum acceptable level of achievement on each assessment.
5 The assessments shall measure those concepts, ideas, and facts which are being
6 taught in teacher education programs in Kentucky.] Upon successful completion of
7 an[the assessments and the] approved teacher preparation program, a professional
8 certificate valid for five (5) years shall be issued.
9 [(b) If an applicant for teacher certification has completed the approved teacher
10 preparation program and has taken but failed to successfully complete the
11 appropriate assessments selected by the Education Professional Standards
12 Board, a conditional certificate may be issued for a period not to exceed one
13 (1) year. The employing school district, in collaboration with the teacher
14 education institution, shall provide technical assistance and mentoring support
15 to the conditionally certified teacher. The teacher shall retake the assessments
16 during the validity period of the conditional certificate. The conditional
17 certificate shall not be reissued. Upon successful completion of the required
18 assessments, a professional certificate valid for five (5) years shall be issued.
19 The Education Professional Standards Board shall promulgate administrative
20 regulations to establish the standards and procedures for issuance of a
21 conditional certificate.

23 Kentucky after the deadline for taking the assessments, a temporary certificate
24 may be issued for a period up to six (6) months. The teacher shall take the
25 assessments during the period of the temporary certificate. If the teacher fails
26 the assessments, the temporary certificate shall be valid only for the current
27 semester. If the teacher passes the assessments, a professional certificate valid

1 for five (5) years shall be issued.
2 (4) A reasonable fee to be paid by the teacher and directly related to the actual cost of
3 the administration of the assessments shall be established by the Education
4 Professional Standards Board. Provisions shall be made for persons having less than
5 minimum levels of performance on any assessment to repeat that assessment, and
6 candidates shall be informed of their strengths and weaknesses in the specific
7 performance areas. The Education Professional Standards Board shall provide for
8 confidentiality of the individual assessment scores. Scores shall be available only to
9 the candidate and to the education officials who are responsible for determining
10 whether established certification standards have been met. Scores shall be used only
11 in the assessment for certification of new teachers and of out-of-state teachers with
12 less than two (2) years of teaching experience who are seeking initial certification
13 in Kentucky.]
14 (4)[(5)] If an applicant establishes eligibility for a five (5) year professional certificate
15 under[ the provisions of] subsection (3)[(3)(a)] of this section, the applicant shall

22 certificate corresponding to the curricula completed.
23 (7)[(8)] The issuance of any certificate, except emergency certificates issued pursuant

25 dependent upon an offer of employment. The certification process, except for
26 emergency certificates, is independent of any job prospects and certification shall
27 be awarded on the basis of completing a teacher preparation program or an
