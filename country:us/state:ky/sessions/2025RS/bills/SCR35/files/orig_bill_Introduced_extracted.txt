2 the United Nations Pact for the Future.
3 WHEREAS, in September 2024, the 79th session of the United Nations General
4 Assembly convened, featuring the Summit of the Future; and
5 WHEREAS, at the summit, member nations of the General Assembly, including the
6 United States, endorsed by consensus the Pact for the Future, which included a Global
7 Digital Compact and a Declaration on Future Generations; and
8 WHEREAS, the Pact was the culmination of a multiyear initiative, launched in
9 2021, combining over 11 different policy briefs; and
10 WHEREAS, though the Pact does not carry legal force, it provides a framework
11 that would severely impact the United States and its citizens, creating political pressures
12 on future presidential administrations; and
13 WHEREAS, the statements in the Pact serve as endorsements of agendas that
14 governments will be pressed to honor in the future. The Pact uses terms according
15 "affirm," "commit," "pledge," and "will," that are often used in binding treaties which, if
16 signed by the United States and ratified by the United States Congress, would carry the
17 force of law; and
18 WHEREAS, the proposals in the Pact would grant more power and authority to the
19 United Nations and the secretary-general and away from member nations, including the
20 United States, by establishing supranational rules and institutions; and
21 WHEREAS, the Pact would serve as a tool to undermine the United States when it
22 does not provide the financial resources demanded by developing countries or ratify
23 agreements; and
24 WHEREAS, one of the proposals would grant the United Nations secretary-general
25 the ability to convene and operate an emergency platform in the event of complex global
26 shocks and have standing authority to convene and operationalize the platform with little
27 or no consultation with governments; and

1 WHEREAS, the proposals presented in the Pact could threaten the right to free
2 speech, potentially granting the United Nations the ability to censor speech it labels as
3 "misinformation" or "disinformation"; and
4 WHEREAS, the definition of misinformation, disinformation, hate speech, and
5 harmful content are highly subjective and are frequently used for political purposes as
6 illustrated by the United Nations and individual governments during the COVID-19
7 pandemic; and
8 WHEREAS, Congress can protect national interests by declaring that the United
9 States is not obliged to honor nonbinding agreements like the Pact even if an
10 administration supports them, and that Congress is not bound by political statements
11 made by the president; and
12 WHEREAS, the Constitution of the United States grants Congress the power of the
13 purse, and it is within the authority of Congress to authorize and provide funding as it
14 deems appropriate and to restrict access to funds contingent on specified conditions
15 regardless of the commitments made by the president;
16 NOW, THEREFORE,
17 Be it resolved by the Senate of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of
18 Kentucky, the House of Representatives concurring therein:
19 Section 1. The United States Congress is respectfully urged to oppose the
20 United Nations Pact for the Future and employ any means within its constitutional power
21 to prevent any implementation of the Pact's proposals.
22 Section 2. The Clerk of the Senate is directed to transmit a copy of this
23 Resolution to the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, the Majority
24 Leader of the United States Senate, and each member of the Kentucky congressional
25 delegation.
