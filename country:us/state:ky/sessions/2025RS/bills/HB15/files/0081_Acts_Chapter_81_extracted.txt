have legal counsel.

within thirty (30) days to the Circuit Court of appropriate venue. A student who is being schooled at home
shall be considered to be enrolled in school.
(4) A student who has had his or her license revoked under[ the provisions of] this section may reapply for a[his
driver's] license as early as the end of the semester during which he or she enrolls in school and successfully
completes the educational requirements. A student may also reapply for a[his driver's] license at the end of a
summer school semester which results in the student having passed at least four (4) courses, or the equivalent
of four (4) courses, during the successive spring and summer semesters, and the courses meet the educational
requirements for graduation. The student[He] shall provide proof issued by the[his] school within the
preceding sixty (60) days that he or she is enrolled and is not academically deficient.
Section 6. Whereas there is a need to expand economic and cultural opportunities for the Commonwealth's
youth through increased transportation options, an emergency is declared to exist, and this Act takes effect upon its
passage and approval by the Governor or upon its otherwise becoming a law.
Signed by Governor March 25, 2025.

Section 5. KRS 159.051 is amended to read as follows:
(1) When a student who is at least fifteen (15) years of age but less than eighteen (18) years of age[age sixteen
(16) or seventeen (17)] drops out of school or is declared to be academically deficient, the school administrator
or his or her designee shall notify the superintendent of schools of the district in which the student is a resident
or is enrolled. The reports shall be made at the end of each semester but may be made earlier in the semester
for accumulated absences. A student shall be deemed to have dropped out of school when he or she has nine
(9) or more unexcused absences in the preceding semester. Any absences due to suspension shall be unexcused
absences. A student shall be deemed to be academically deficient when he or she has not received passing
grades in at least four (4) courses, or the equivalent of four (4) courses, in the preceding semester. The local
school board shall adopt a policy to reflect a similar standard for academic deficiency for students in
alternative, special education, or part-time programs.
(2) Within ten (10) days after receiving the notification, the superintendent shall report the student's name and
Social Security number to the Transportation Cabinet. As soon as possible thereafter, the cabinet shall notify
the student that his or her operator's license, intermediate license, permit, or privilege to operate a motor
vehicle has been revoked or denied and shall inform the student of his or her right to a hearing before the
District Court of appropriate venue to show cause as to the reasons the[his] license, permit, or privilege should
be reinstated. Within fifteen (15) days after this notice is sent, the custodial parent, legal guardian, or next
friend of the student may request an ex parte hearing before the District Court. The student shall not be
charged District Court filing fees. The notification shall inform the student that he or she is not required to
have legal counsel.
(3) In order for the student to have the[his] license reinstated, the court shall be satisfied that:
(a) The license is needed to meet family obligations or family economic considerations which, if
unsatisfied, would create an undue hardship; or
(b) The student is the only licensed driver in the household; or

CHAPTER 81 5
(c) The student is not considered a dropout or academically deficient pursuant to this section.
If the student satisfies the court, the court shall notify the cabinet to reinstate the student's license at no cost.
The student, if aggrieved by a decision of the court issued pursuant to this section, may appeal the decision
within thirty (30) days to the Circuit Court of appropriate venue. A student who is being schooled at home
shall be considered to be enrolled in school.
(4) A student who has had his or her license revoked under[ the provisions of] this section may reapply for a[his
driver's] license as early as the end of the semester during which he or she enrolls in school and successfully
completes the educational requirements. A student may also reapply for a[his driver's] license at the end of a
summer school semester which results in the student having passed at least four (4) courses, or the equivalent
of four (4) courses, during the successive spring and summer semesters, and the courses meet the educational
requirements for graduation. The student[He] shall provide proof issued by the[his] school within the
preceding sixty (60) days that he or she is enrolled and is not academically deficient.
Section 6. Whereas there is a need to expand economic and cultural opportunities for the Commonwealth's
youth through increased transportation options, an emergency is declared to exist, and this Act takes effect upon its
passage and approval by the Governor or upon its otherwise becoming a law.
Signed by Governor March 25, 2025.
