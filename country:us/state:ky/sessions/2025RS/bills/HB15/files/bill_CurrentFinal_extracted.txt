1 notify the superintendent of schools of the district in which the student is a resident

26 (b) The student is the only licensed driver in the household; or
27 (c) The student is not considered a dropout or academically deficient pursuant to

6 shall be considered to be enrolled in school.
7 (4) A student who has had his or her license revoked under[ the provisions of] this
8 section may reapply for a[his driver's] license as early as the end of the semester

11 summer school semester which results in the student having passed at least four (4)
12 courses, or the equivalent of four (4) courses, during the successive spring and
13 summer semesters, and the courses meet the educational requirements for
14 graduation. The student[He] shall provide proof issued by the[his] school within
15 the preceding sixty (60) days that he or she is enrolled and is not academically
16 deficient.
17 Section 6. Whereas there is a need to expand economic and cultural
18 opportunities for the Commonwealth's youth through increased transportation options, an
19 emergency is declared to exist, and this Act takes effect upon its passage and approval by
20 the Governor or upon its otherwise becoming a law.
