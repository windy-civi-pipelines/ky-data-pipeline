10 may be made or may, in lieu thereof, order the return of the property to the
11 lawful owner or claimant.
12 (b) If the lawful owner or claimant does not assert his or her claim to the property
13 after notification or if he or she renounces his or her claim to the property, the
14 property shall be disposed of as provided in this section.
15 (c) It shall be the duty of all peace officers and other public officers or officials
16 having knowledge of the lawful owner or claimant of property subject to

23 destroyed[sold] pursuant to KRS 16.220.

9 otherwise a burdensome asset, the court may abandon any interest in such
10 property. Property which is abandoned pursuant to this section shall be
11 returned to the lawful claimant upon payment of expenses for keeping the

7 identified or is identifiable. If a lawful owner or claimant has been identified
8 or is identifiable, the court shall notify the owner or claimant that the property
9 is being held and specify a reasonable period of time during which the claim
10 may be made or may, in lieu thereof, order the return of the property to the
11 lawful owner or claimant.
12 (b) If the lawful owner or claimant does not assert his or her claim to the property
13 after notification or if he or she renounces his or her claim to the property, the
14 property shall be disposed of as provided in this section.
15 (c) It shall be the duty of all peace officers and other public officers or officials
16 having knowledge of the lawful owner or claimant of property subject to
