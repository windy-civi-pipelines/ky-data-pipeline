4 WHEREAS, Lexington was filled with patriotic fervor during World War I, as
5 leaders organized the Hospital Corps of Good Samaritan Base Hospital No. 40, and

8 the war effort during World War II; and
9 WHEREAS, in the post-war years, Lexington soon became one of the fastest
10 growing cities in the country; and
11 WHEREAS, in the 1950s, out-of-state companies began to move to Lexington,

20 protecting the environment with up-to-date sewers, developing a modern transportation
21 system, protecting its neighborhoods, carrying out its rightful identity as the Horse
22 Capital of the World, becoming a leading economic engine for the entire Commonwealth,
23 keeping its cost of living low, engaging in smart, planned growth, keeping its downtown
24 vibrant, and investing in quality of life; and
25 WHEREAS, the need for continuing change and improvement drives Lexington-
