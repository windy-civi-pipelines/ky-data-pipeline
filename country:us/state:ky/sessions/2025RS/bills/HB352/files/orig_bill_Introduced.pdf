2 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
3 Section 1. KRS 164.020 is amended to read as follows:
4 The Council on Postsecondary Education in Kentucky shall:
5 (1) Develop and implement the strategic agenda with the advice and counsel of the

9 (2) Revise the strategic agenda and strategic implementation plan with the advice and
10 counsel of the committee as set forth in KRS 164.004;
11 (3) Develop a system of public accountability related to the strategic agenda by
12 evaluating the performance and effectiveness of the state's postsecondary system.
13 The council shall prepare a report in conjunction with the accountability reporting
14 described in KRS 164.095, which shall be submitted to the committee, the
15 Governor, and the General Assembly by December 1 annually. This report shall
16 include a description of contributions by postsecondary institutions to the quality of

1 (7) Develop plans that may be required by federal legislation. The council shall for all
2 purposes of federal legislation relating to planning be considered the "single state
3 agency" as that term may be used in federal legislation. When federal legislation
4 requires additional representation on any "single state agency," the Council on
5 Postsecondary Education shall establish advisory groups necessary to satisfy federal
6 legislative or regulatory guidelines;
7 (8) (a) Determine tuition and approve the minimum qualifications for admission to

11 and enters a Kentucky postsecondary education institution within two (2)
12 years of high school graduation and is not an alien illegally present in the
13 United States. In determining the tuition for non-Kentucky residents, the
14 council shall consider the fees required of Kentucky students by institutions in
15 adjoining states, the resident fees charged by other states, the total actual per
16 student cost of training in the institutions for which the fees are being
17 determined, and the ratios of Kentucky students to non-Kentucky students
18 comprising the enrollments of the respective institutions, and other factors the
19 council may in its sole discretion deem pertinent, except that the Kentucky
20 Community and Technical College System may assess a mandatory student
21 fee not to exceed eight dollars ($8) per credit hour to be used exclusively for
22 debt service on amounts not to exceed seventy-five percent (75%) of the total
23 projects cost of the Kentucky Community and Technical College System
24 agency bond projects included in 2014 Ky. Acts ch. 117, Part II, J., 11.
25 (b) The Kentucky Community and Technical College System mandatory fee
26 established in this subsection shall only be used for debt service on agency
27 bond projects.

1 (c) Any fee established as provided by this subsection shall cease to be assessed
2 upon the retirement of the project bonds for which it services debt.
3 (d) Prior to the issuance of any bonds, the Kentucky Community and Technical
4 College System shall certify in writing to the secretary of the Finance and
5 Administration Cabinet that sufficient funds have been raised to meet the
6 local match equivalent to twenty-five percent (25%) of the total project cost;
7 (9) Devise, establish, and periodically review and revise policies to be used in making
8 recommendations to the Governor for consideration in developing
9 recommendations to the General Assembly for appropriations to the universities,
10 the Kentucky Community and Technical College System, and to support strategies
11 for persons to maintain necessary levels of literacy throughout their lifetimes. The
12 council has sole discretion, with advice of the Strategic Committee on
13 Postsecondary Education and the executive officers of the postsecondary education
14 system, to devise policies that provide for allocation of funds among the
15 universities and the Kentucky Community and Technical College System;
16 (10) Lead and provide staff support for the biennial budget process as provided under
17 KRS Chapter 48, in cooperation with the committee;
18 (11) (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, review and approve all
19 capital construction projects covered by KRS 45.750(1)(f), including real
20 property acquisitions, and regardless of the source of funding for projects or
21 acquisitions. Approval of capital projects and real property acquisitions shall
22 be on a basis consistent with the strategic agenda and the mission of the
23 respective universities and the Kentucky Community and Technical College
24 System.
25 (b) The organized groups that are establishing community college satellites as
26 branches of existing community colleges in the counties of Laurel, Leslie, and

2 other than operating costs that shall be paid as part of the operating budget of
3 the main community college of which the satellite is a branch, are authorized
4 to begin construction of the satellite on or after January 1, 1998;
5 (12) Require reports from the executive officer of each institution it deems necessary for
6 the effectual performance of its duties;

8 services and programs provided by private postsecondary institutions and shall

10 postsecondary institutions. Receive and consider an annual report prepared by the
11 Association of Independent Kentucky Colleges and Universities stating the
12 condition of independent institutions, listing opportunities for more collaboration
13 between the state and independent institutions and other information as appropriate;
14 (14) Establish course credit, transfer, and degree components as required in KRS
15 164.2951;
16 (15) Define and approve the offering of all postsecondary education technical, associate,

18 in the public postsecondary education institutions. The council shall expedite
19 wherever possible the approval of requests from the Kentucky Community and
20 Technical College System board of regents relating to new certificate, diploma,
21 technical, or associate degree programs of a vocational-technical and occupational
22 nature. Without the consent of the General Assembly, the council shall not abolish
23 or limit the total enrollment of the general program offered at any community
24 college to meet the goal of reasonable access throughout the Commonwealth to a
25 two (2) year course of general studies designed for transfer to a baccalaureate
26 program. This does not restrict or limit the authority of the council, as set forth in
27 this section, to eliminate or make changes in individual programs within that

24 obtain a temporary waiver, if the institution has made substantial progress toward
25 meeting its equal educational opportunity goals;
26 (20) Ensure the coordination, transferability, and connectivity of technology among
