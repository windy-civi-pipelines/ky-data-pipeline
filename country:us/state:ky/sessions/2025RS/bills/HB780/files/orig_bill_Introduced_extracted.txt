2 capacities, it shall be presumed that the illegal, nonprescribed substance or

5 other liability of such employer to the employee, his legal representative, husband
6 or wife, parents, dependents, next of kin, and anyone otherwise entitled to recover
7 damages from such employer at law or in admiralty on account of such injury or
8 death. For purposes of this section, the term "employer" shall include a "contractor"
9 covered by [subsection (2) of ]KRS 342.610(2), whether or not the subcontractor
10 has in fact, secured the payment of compensation. The liability of an employer to

12 or death of an employee of such employer arising out of and in the course of
13 employment and caused by a breach of any duty or obligation owed by such
14 employer to such other shall be limited to the amount of compensation and other
15 benefits for which such employer is liable under this chapter on account of such
16 injury or death, unless such other and the employer by written contract have agreed
17 to share liability in a different manner. The exemption from liability given an
18 employer by this section shall also extend to such employer's carrier and to all
19 employees, officers or directors of such employer or carrier, provided the
20 exemption from liability given an employee, officer or director or an employer or
21 carrier shall not apply in any case where the injury or death is proximately caused
22 by the willful and unprovoked physical aggression of such employee, officer or
23 director.
24 (2) If an employer fails to secure payment of compensation as required by this chapter,
25 an injured employee, or his legal representative in case death results from the
26 injury, may claim compensation under this chapter and in addition may maintain an
27 action at law or in admiralty for damages on account of such injury or death,

1 provided that the amount of compensation shall be credited against the amount
2 received in such action, and provided that, if the amount of compensation is larger
3 than the amount of damages received, the amount of damages less the employee's
4 legal fees and expenses shall be credited against the amount of compensation. In
5 such action the defendant may not plead as a defense that the injury was caused by
6 the negligence of a fellow servant, that the employee assumed the risks of his
7 employment, or that the injury was due to the contributory negligence of the
8 employee.
9 (3) An employer shall retain all common law defenses against any action by an
10 employee who elects not to be covered, as provided under[ subsection (6) of] KRS
11 342.650(4).
12 (4) (a) Notwithstanding any voluntary agreement entered into between the United
13 States Department of Labor and a franchisee, neither a franchisee nor a
14 franchisee's employee shall be deemed to be an employee of the franchisor for
15 any purpose under this chapter.
16 (b) Notwithstanding any voluntary agreement entered into between the United
17 States Department of Labor and a franchisor, neither a franchisor nor a
18 franchisor's employee shall be deemed to be an employee of the franchisee for
19 any purpose under this chapter.
20 (c) For purposes of this subsection, "franchisee" and "franchisor" have the same
21 meanings as in 16 C.F.R. sec. 436.1.

5 other liability of such employer to the employee, his legal representative, husband
6 or wife, parents, dependents, next of kin, and anyone otherwise entitled to recover

8 death. For purposes of this section, the term "employer" shall include a "contractor"
9 covered by [subsection (2) of ]KRS 342.610(2), whether or not the subcontractor
10 has in fact, secured the payment of compensation. The liability of an employer to

12 or death of an employee of such employer arising out of and in the course of
13 employment and caused by a breach of any duty or obligation owed by such
14 employer to such other shall be limited to the amount of compensation and other
15 benefits for which such employer is liable under this chapter on account of such
16 injury or death, unless such other and the employer by written contract have agreed
17 to share liability in a different manner. The exemption from liability given an
18 employer by this section shall also extend to such employer's carrier and to all
19 employees, officers or directors of such employer or carrier, provided the
20 exemption from liability given an employee, officer or director or an employer or
21 carrier shall not apply in any case where the injury or death is proximately caused
22 by the willful and unprovoked physical aggression of such employee, officer or
23 director.
24 (2) If an employer fails to secure payment of compensation as required by this chapter,
25 an injured employee, or his legal representative in case death results from the
26 injury, may claim compensation under this chapter and in addition may maintain an
27 action at law or in admiralty for damages on account of such injury or death,

1 provided that the amount of compensation shall be credited against the amount
2 received in such action, and provided that, if the amount of compensation is larger
3 than the amount of damages received, the amount of damages less the employee's
4 legal fees and expenses shall be credited against the amount of compensation. In
5 such action the defendant may not plead as a defense that the injury was caused by
6 the negligence of a fellow servant, that the employee assumed the risks of his
7 employment, or that the injury was due to the contributory negligence of the
8 employee.
9 (3) An employer shall retain all common law defenses against any action by an
10 employee who elects not to be covered, as provided under[ subsection (6) of] KRS
11 342.650(4).
12 (4) (a) Notwithstanding any voluntary agreement entered into between the United

14 franchisee's employee shall be deemed to be an employee of the franchisor for
15 any purpose under this chapter.
16 (b) Notwithstanding any voluntary agreement entered into between the United
17 States Department of Labor and a franchisor, neither a franchisor nor a
18 franchisor's employee shall be deemed to be an employee of the franchisee for
19 any purpose under this chapter.
20 (c) For purposes of this subsection, "franchisee" and "franchisor" have the same
21 meanings as in 16 C.F.R. sec. 436.1.
