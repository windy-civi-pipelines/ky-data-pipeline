the protection of all members of the school council from liability arising in the course of pursuing their duties
as members of the council.
(5) All schools shall implement school-based decision making in accordance with this section and with the policy
adopted by the local board pursuant to this section. Upon favorable vote of a majority of the faculty at the
school and a majority of at least twenty-five (25) voting parents of students enrolled in the school, a school
meeting its goal as determined by the Department of Education pursuant to KRS 158.6455 may apply to the
Kentucky Board of Education for exemption from the requirement to implement school-based decision
making, and the state board shall grant the exemption. The voting by the parents on the matter of exemption
from implementing school-based decision making shall be in an election conducted by the parent and teacher
organization of the school or, if none exists, the largest organization of parents formed for this purpose.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, a local school district shall not be required to implement
school-based decision making if the local school district contains only one (1) school.
(6) The Department of Education shall provide professional development activities to assist schools in
implementing school-based decision making. School council members elected for the first time shall complete
a minimum of six (6) clock hours of training in the process of school-based decision making, no later than
thirty (30) days after the beginning of the service year for which they are elected to serve. School council
members who have served on a school council at least one (1) year shall complete a minimum of three (3)
clock hours of training in the process of school-based decision making no later than one hundred twenty (120)
days after the beginning of the service year for which they are elected to serve. Experienced members may
participate in the training for new members to fulfill their training requirement. School council training

CHAPTER 86 7
required under this subsection shall be conducted by trainers endorsed by the Department of Education. By
November 1 of each year, the principal through the local superintendent shall forward to the Department of
Education the names and addresses of each council member and verify that the required training has been
completed. School council members elected to fill a vacancy shall complete the applicable training within
thirty (30) days of their election.
(7) A school that chooses to have school-based decision making but would like to be exempt from the
administrative structure set forth by this section may develop a model for implementing school-based decision
making, including but not limited to a description of the membership, organization, duties, and responsibilities
of a school council. The school shall submit the model through the local board of education to the
commissioner of education and the Kentucky Board of Education, which shall have final authority for
approval. The application for approval of the model shall show evidence that it has been developed by
representatives of the parents, students, certified personnel, and the administrators of the school and that two-
thirds (2/3) of the faculty have agreed to the model.
(8) The Kentucky Board of Education, upon recommendation of the commissioner of education, shall adopt by
administrative regulation a formula by which school district funds shall be allocated to each school council.
Included in the school council formula shall be an allocation for professional development that is at least sixty-
five percent (65%) of the district's per pupil state allocation for professional development for each student in
average daily attendance in the school. The school council shall plan professional development in compliance
with requirements specified in KRS 156.095, except as provided in KRS 158.649. School councils of small
schools shall be encouraged to work with other school councils to maximize professional development
opportunities.
(9) (a) No board member, superintendent of schools, district employee, or member of a school council shall
intentionally engage in a pattern of practice which is detrimental to the successful implementation of or
circumvents the intent of school-based decision making to allow the professional staff members of a
school and parents to be involved in the decision making process in working toward meeting the
educational goals established in KRS 158.645 and 158.6451 or to make decisions in areas of policy
assigned to a school council pursuant to paragraph (i) of subsection (2) of this section.
(b) An affected party who believes a violation of this subsection has occurred may file a written complaint
with the Office of Education Accountability. The office shall investigate the complaint and resolve the
conflict, if possible, or forward the matter to the Kentucky Board of Education.
(c) The Kentucky Board of Education shall conduct a hearing in accordance with KRS Chapter 13B for
complaints referred by the Office of Education Accountability.
(d) If the state board determines a violation has occurred, the party shall be subject to reprimand. A second
violation of this subsection may be grounds for removing a superintendent or a member of a school
council from office or grounds for dismissal of an employee for misconduct in office or willful neglect
of duty.
(e) Notwithstanding paragraph (d) of this subsection and KRS 7.410(2)(c), if the state board determines a
violation of the nondisclosure agreement required by subsection (2)(h)2.b. of this section by a school
council member has occurred, the state board shall remove the member from the school council, and the
member shall be permanently prohibited from serving on any school council in the district.
(10) Notwithstanding subsections (1) to (9) of this section, a school's right to establish or maintain a school-based
decision making council and the powers, duties, and authority granted to a school council may be rescinded or
the school council's role may be advisory if the commissioner of education or the Kentucky Board of
Education takes action under KRS 160.346.
(11) Each school council of a school containing grades K-5 or any combination thereof, or if there is no school
council, the principal, shall develop and implement a wellness policy that includes moderate to vigorous
physical activity each day and encourages healthy choices among students. The policy may permit physical
activity to be considered part of the instructional day, not to exceed thirty (30) minutes per day, or one hundred
and fifty (150) minutes per week. Each school council, or if there is no school council, the principal, shall
