1 academic and workforce needs for a program, consideration of whether the program
2 can be effectively delivered through a collaborative effort with an existing program
3 at another public university within the Commonwealth, and the capacity of a
4 university to effectively offer the program. A university requesting approval of an
5 advanced practice doctoral program shall be required to provide assurance that
6 funding for the program will not impair funding of any existing program at any
7 other public university.
8 (4) The council shall promulgate administrative regulations setting forth the agreed-on
9 criteria and conditions identified under subsection (3) of this section.

14 doctor's degrees required for professional practice and licensure in medicine,

18 exempted from the requirements of this paragraph, and Kentucky State
19 University may offer a Doctor of Philosophy in Integrated Agroecology and
20 Sustainable Agriculture; or
21 (b) Describe itself in official publications or in marketing materials as a research
22 university or research institution. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed
23 as precluding a comprehensive university from conducting basic, applied, or
24 translational research.
