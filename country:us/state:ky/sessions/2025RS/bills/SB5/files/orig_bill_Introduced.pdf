2 school or program that is subject to the waiver, the academic achievement of the
3 students enrolled in the schools or program, comparisons of those students with
4 similar students across the state, and any other evidence of the waiver's benefit to
5 student academic achievement. If the state board finds that the waiver has had a
6 positive impact on the school's or program's operation or the academic
7 achievement of students, then the renewal request shall be approved. An
8 approved renewal request shall extend the waiver for an additional three (3)
9 school years.
10 (8) Any school that is subject to a waiver shall admit any and all children eligible to
11 attend the school subject to the local board's policies.

13 specific waiver previously granted has hindered school or program operations,
14 endangered students, impeded student academic achievement, or supported
15 financial malfeasance or criminal activity, then the waiver shall be rescinded.
16 The existence of a waiver shall not negate the legal duties or professional
17 responsibilities of a district employee.

10 classes of the respective county and independent school districts have completed
11 work for which the adopted book then in use was originally intended. Nothing in
12 this section shall apply to the supplementary books that are needed from time to

Page 20 of 55
XXXX 2/17/2025 9:02 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1425
1 157.320, shall be computed by dividing the amount appropriated for this
2 purpose by the prior year's statewide average daily attendance.
3 (b) When determining the biennial appropriations for the program, the average
4 daily attendance for each fiscal year shall include an estimate of the number
5 of students graduating early under the provisions of KRS 158.142.
6 (2) Each district shall receive an amount equal to the base funding level for each pupil
7 in average daily attendance in the district in the previous year, except a district shall
8 receive an amount equal to one-half (1/2) of the state portion of the average
9 statewide per pupil guaranteed base funding level for each student who graduated
10 early under the provisions of KRS 158.142. Each district's base funding level shall
11 be adjusted by the following factors:
12 (a) The number of at-risk students in the district. At-risk students shall be
13 identified as those approved for the free lunch program under state and federal
14 guidelines. The number of at-risk students shall be multiplied by a factor to be
15 established by the General Assembly. Funds generated under this paragraph
16 may be used to pay for:
17 1. Alternative programs for students who are at risk of dropping out of
18 school before achieving a diploma; and
19 2. A hazardous duty pay supplement as determined by the local board of
20 education to the teachers who work in alternative programs with
21 students who are violent or assaultive;
22 (b) The number and types of exceptional children in the district as defined by
23 KRS 157.200. Specific weights for each category of exceptionality shall be
24 used in the calculation of the add-on factor for exceptional children; and
25 (c) Transportation costs. The per-pupil cost of transportation shall be calculated
26 as provided by KRS 157.370. Districts which contract to furnish
27 transportation to students attending nonpublic schools may adopt any payment

1 formula which ensures that no public school funds are used for the
2 transportation of nonpublic students.
3 (3) Beginning with the 2015-2016 school year and each year thereafter, the General
4 Assembly shall annually allocate funds equal to one-half (1/2) of the state portion
5 of the average statewide per pupil guaranteed base funding level for each student
6 who graduated early under the provisions of KRS 158.142 the previous school year
7 to the Kentucky Higher Education Assistance Authority for deposit in the early
8 graduation scholarship trust fund.
9 (4) The program to support education excellence in Kentucky shall be fully
10 implemented by the 1994-95 school year.
11 (5) (a) Except for those schools which have implemented school-based decision
12 making, the commissioner of education shall enforce maximum class sizes for

20 4. Thirty-one (31) in grades seven (7) to twelve (12).
21 (b) Except for those schools which have implemented school-based decision
22 making, class size loads for middle and secondary school classroom teachers
23 shall not exceed the equivalent of one hundred fifty (150) pupil hours per day.
24 (c) The commissioner of education, upon approval of the Kentucky Board of
25 Education, shall adopt administrative regulations for enforcing this provision.
26 These administrative regulations shall include procedures for a superintendent
27 to request an exemption from the Kentucky Board of Education when unusual

1 circumstances warrant an increased class size for an individual class. A
2 request for an exemption shall include specific reasons for the increased class
3 size with a plan for reducing the class size prior to the beginning of the next
4 school year. A district shall not receive in any one (1) year exemptions for
5 more classes than enroll twenty percent (20%) of the pupils in the primary
6 grades and grades four (4) through eight (8).
7 (d) In all schools the commissioner of education shall enforce the special
8 education maximum class sizes set by administrative regulations adopted by
9 the Kentucky Board of Education. A superintendent may request an
10 exemption pursuant to paragraph (c) of this subsection. A local school council
11 may request a waiver relating to maximum class size pursuant to Section 3 of
12 this Act in the same manner as a local board of education[KRS 156.160(2)].
13 An exemption or waiver shall not be granted if the increased class size will
14 impede any exceptional child from achieving his or her individual education
15 program in the least restrictive environment.
16 (6) In grades four (4) through six (6) with combined grades, the maximum class size
17 shall be the average daily attendance upon which funding is appropriated for the
18 lowest assigned grade in the class. There shall be no exceptions to the maximum
19 class size for combined classes. In combined classes other than the primary grades,
20 no ungraded students shall be placed in a combined class with graded students. In
21 addition, there shall be no more than two (2) consecutive grade levels combined in
22 any one (1) class in grades four (4) through six (6). However, this shall not apply to
23 schools which have implemented school-based decision making.
24 (7) If a local school district, through its admission and release committee, determines
25 that an appropriate program in the least restrictive environment for a particular child
26 with a disability includes either part-time or full-time enrollment with a private
27 school or agency within the state or a public or private agency in another state, the
Page 23 of 55

2 that the child is in attendance at the school or agency, contingent upon approval by
3 the commissioner of education.
4 (8) Pupils attending a center for child learning and study established under an
5 agreement pursuant to KRS 65.210 to 65.300 shall, for the purpose of calculating
6 average daily attendance, be considered as in attendance in the school district in
7 which the child legally resides and which is party to the agreement. For purposes of
8 subsection (1) of this section, teachers who are actually employees of the joint or
9 cooperative action shall be considered as employees of each school district which is
10 a party to the agreement.
11 (9) Program funding shall be increased when the average daily attendance in any
12 district for the first two (2) months of the current school year is greater than the
13 average daily attendance of the district for the first two (2) months of the previous
14 school year. The program funds allotted the district shall be increased by the
15 percent of increase. The average daily attendance in kindergarten is the
16 kindergarten full-time equivalent pupils in average daily attendance.
17 (10) If the average daily attendance for the current school year in any district decreases
18 by ten percent (10%) or more than the average daily attendance for the previous
19 school year, the average daily attendance for purposes of calculating program
20 funding for the next school year shall be increased by an amount equal to two-thirds
21 (2/3) of the decrease in average daily attendance. If the average daily attendance
22 remains the same or decreases in the succeeding school year, the average daily
23 attendance for purposes of calculating program funding for the following school
24 year shall be increased by an amount equal to one-third (1/3) of the decrease for the
25 first year of the decline.
26 (11) If the percentage of attendance of any school district shall have been reduced more
27 than two percent (2%) during the previous school year, the program funding
Page 24 of 55
XXXX 2/17/2025 9:02 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1425
1 allotted the district for the current school year shall be increased by the difference in
2 the percentage of attendance for the two (2) years immediately prior to the current
3 school year less two percent (2%).
4 (12) (a) Instructional salaries for vocational agriculture classes shall be for twelve (12)
5 months per year. Vocational agriculture teachers shall be responsible for the
6 following program of instruction during the time period beyond the regular
7 school term established by the local board of education: supervision and
8 instruction of students in agriculture experience programs; group and
9 individual instruction of farmers and agribusinessmen; supervision of student
10 members of agricultural organizations who are involved in leadership training
11 or other activity required by state or federal law; or any program of vocational
12 agriculture established by the Department of Education. During extended
13 employment, no vocational agriculture teacher shall receive salary on a day
14 that the teacher is scheduled to attend an institution of higher education class
15 which could be credited toward meeting any certification requirement.
16 (b) Each teacher of agriculture employed shall submit an annual plan for summer
17 program to the local school superintendent for approval. The summer plan
18 shall include a list of tasks to be performed, purposes for each task, and time
19 to be spent on each task. Approval by the local school superintendent shall be
20 in compliance with the guidelines developed by the Department of Education.
21 The supervision and accountability of teachers of vocational agriculture's
22 summer programs shall be the responsibility of the local school
23 superintendent. The local school superintendent shall submit to the
24 commissioner of education a completed report of summer tasks for each
25 vocational agriculture teacher. Twenty percent (20%) of the approved
26 vocational agriculture programs shall be audited annually by the State
27 Department of Education to determine that the summer plan has been properly

5 properly identified according to Kentucky Board of Education administrative
6 regulations. Attendance shall be calculated pursuant to KRS 157.270 and shall
7 be reported monthly on forms provided by the Department of Education; and
8 (b) Pursuant to administrative regulations of the Kentucky Board of Education,
9 local school districts shall be reimbursed for home and hospital instruction for
10 pupils unable to attend regular school sessions because of short-term health
11 impairments. A reimbursement formula shall be established by administrative
12 regulations to include such factors as a reasonable per hour, per child
13 allotment for teacher instructional time, with a maximum number of funded
14 hours per week, a reasonable allotment for teaching supplies and equipment,
15 and a reasonable allotment for travel expenses to and from instructional
16 assignments, but the formula shall not include an allotment for capital outlay.
17 Attendance shall be calculated pursuant to KRS 157.270 and shall be reported

1 recalculate its funds allocated under this section if the current year average daily
2 attendance for the twenty (20) day school month as defined in KRS 158.060(1) that
3 contains the most days within the calendar month of January exceeds the prior year
4 adjusted average daily attendance plus growth by at least one percent (1%). Any
5 adjustments in the allotments approved under this subsection shall be proportional
6 to the remaining days in the school year and subject to available funds under the
7 program to support education excellence in Kentucky.
8 (17) To calculate the state portion of the program to support education excellence in
9 Kentucky for a school district, the Department of Education shall subtract the local
10 effort required under KRS 157.390(5) from the calculated base funding under the
11 program to support education excellence in Kentucky, as required by this section.
12 The value of the real estate used in this calculation shall be the lesser of the current
13 year assessment or the prior year assessment increased by four percent (4%) plus
14 the value of current year new property. The calculation under this subsection shall
15 be subject to available funds.
16 (18) Notwithstanding any other statute or budget of the Commonwealth language to the
17 contrary, time missed due to shortening days for emergencies may be made up by
