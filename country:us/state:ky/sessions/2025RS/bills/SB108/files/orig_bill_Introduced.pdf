19 of the water line extension or improvement project, increase rates to its
20 customers;
21 until that person has obtained from the Public Service Commission a
22 certificate that public convenience and necessity require the service or
23 construction.
24 (b) Upon the filing of an application for a certificate, and after any public hearing
25 which the commission may in its discretion conduct for all interested parties,
26 the commission may issue or refuse to issue the certificate, or issue it in part
27 and refuse it in part, except that the commission shall not refuse or modify an
Page 2 of 16

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1216
1 application submitted under KRS 278.023 without consent by the parties to
2 the agreement.
3 (c) The commission, when considering an application for a certificate to construct
4 a base load electric generating facility, may consider the policy of the General
5 Assembly to foster and encourage use of Kentucky coal by electric utilities
6 serving the Commonwealth.
7 (d) The commission, when considering an application for a certificate to construct
8 an electric transmission line, may consider the interstate benefits expected to
9 be achieved by the proposed construction or modification of electric
10 transmission facilities in the Commonwealth.
11 (e) Unless exercised within one (1) year from the grant thereof, exclusive of any
12 delay due to the order of any court or failure to obtain any necessary grant or
13 consent, the authority conferred by the issuance of the certificate of
14 convenience and necessity shall be void, but the beginning of any new
15 construction or facility in good faith within the time prescribed by the
16 commission and the prosecution thereof with reasonable diligence shall
17 constitute an exercise of authority under the certificate.
18 (2) For the purposes of this section, construction of any electric transmission line of
19 one hundred thirty-eight (138) kilovolts or more and of more than five thousand
20 two hundred eighty (5,280) feet in length shall not be considered an ordinary
21 extension of an existing system in the usual course of business and shall require a
22 certificate of public convenience and necessity. However, ordinary extensions of
23 existing systems in the usual course of business not requiring such a certificate shall
24 include:
25 (a) The replacement or upgrading of any existing electric transmission line; or
26 (b) The relocation of any existing electric transmission line to accommodate
27 construction or expansion of a roadway or other transportation infrastructure;

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1216
1 or
2 (c) An electric transmission line that is constructed solely to serve a single
3 customer and that will pass over no property other than that owned by the
4 customer to be served.
5 (3) Prior to granting a certificate of public convenience and necessity to construct
6 facilities to provide the services set forth in KRS 278.010(3)(f), the commission
7 shall require the applicant to provide a surety bond, or a reasonable guaranty that
8 the applicant shall operate the facilities in a reasonable and reliable manner for a
9 period of at least five (5) years. The surety bond or guaranty shall be in an amount
10 sufficient to ensure the full and faithful performance by the applicant or its
11 successors of the obligations and requirements of this chapter and of all applicable
12 federal and state environmental requirements. However, no surety bond or guaranty
13 shall be required for an applicant that is a water district or water association or for
14 an applicant that the commission finds has sufficient assets to ensure the continuity
15 of sewage service.
16 (4) No utility shall exercise any right or privilege under any franchise or permit, after
17 the exercise of that right or privilege has been voluntarily suspended or
18 discontinued for more than one (1) year, without first obtaining from the
19 commission, in the manner provided in subsection (1) of this section, a certificate of
20 convenience and necessity authorizing the exercise of that right or privilege.
21 (5) No utility shall apply for or obtain any franchise, license, or permit from any city or
22 other governmental agency until it has obtained from the commission, in the
23 manner provided in subsection (1) of this section, a certificate of convenience and
24 necessity showing that there is a demand and need for the service sought to be
25 rendered.
26 (6) No person shall acquire or transfer ownership of, or control, or the right to control,
27 any utility under the jurisdiction of the commission by sale of assets, transfer of
Page 4 of 16
XXXX 2/4/2025 2:40 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1216
1 stock, or otherwise, or abandon the same, without prior approval by the
2 commission. The commission shall grant its approval if the person acquiring the
3 utility has the financial, technical, and managerial abilities to provide reasonable
4 service.
5 (7) No individual, group, syndicate, general or limited partnership, association,
6 corporation, joint stock company, trust, or other entity (an "acquirer"), whether or
7 not organized under the laws of this state, shall acquire control, either directly or
8 indirectly, of any utility furnishing utility service in this state, without having first
9 obtained the approval of the commission. Any acquisition of control without prior
10 authorization shall be void and of no effect. As used in this subsection, the term
11 "control" means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or
12 cause the direction of the management and policies of a utility, whether through the
13 ownership of voting securities, by effecting a change in the composition of the
14 board of directors, by contract or otherwise. Control shall be presumed to exist if
15 any individual or entity, directly or indirectly, owns ten percent (10%) or more of
16 the voting securities of the utility. This presumption may be rebutted by a showing
17 that ownership does not in fact confer control. Application for any approval or
18 authorization shall be made to the commission in writing, verified by oath or
19 affirmation, and be in a form and contain the information as the commission
20 requires. The commission shall approve any proposed acquisition when it finds that
21 the same is to be made in accordance with law, for a proper purpose and is
22 consistent with the public interest. The commission may make investigation and
23 hold hearings in the matter as it deems necessary, and thereafter may grant any
24 application under this subsection in whole or in part and with modification and
25 upon terms and conditions as it deems necessary or appropriate. The commission
26 shall grant, modify, refuse, or prescribe appropriate terms and conditions with
27 respect to every such application within sixty (60) days after the filing of the
Page 5 of 16
XXXX 2/4/2025 2:40 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1216
1 application therefor, unless it is necessary, for good cause shown, to continue the
2 application for up to sixty (60) additional days. The order continuing the application
3 shall state fully the facts that make continuance necessary. In the absence of that
4 action within that period of time, any proposed acquisition shall be deemed to be
5 approved.
6 (8) Subsection (7) of this section shall not apply to any acquisition of control of any:
7 (a) Utility which derives a greater percentage of its gross revenue from business
8 in another jurisdiction than from business in this state if the commission
9 determines that the other jurisdiction has statutes or rules which are applicable
10 and are being applied and which afford protection to ratepayers in this state
11 substantially equal to that afforded such ratepayers by subsection (7) of this
12 section;
13 (b) Utility by an acquirer who directly, or indirectly through one (1) or more
14 intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with,
15 the utility, including any entity created at the direction of such utility for
16 purposes of corporate reorganization; or
17 (c) Utility pursuant to the terms of any indebtedness of the utility, provided the
18 issuance of indebtedness was approved by the commission.
19 (9) In a proceeding on an application filed pursuant to this section, any interested
20 person, including a person over whose property the proposed transmission line will
21 cross, may request intervention, and the commission shall, if requested, conduct a
22 public hearing in the county in which the transmission line is proposed to be
23 constructed, or, if the transmission line is proposed to be constructed in more than
24 one county, in one of those counties. The commission shall issue its decision no
25 later than ninety (90) days after the application is filed, unless the commission
26 extends this period, for good cause, to one hundred twenty (120) days. The
27 commission may utilize the provisions of KRS 278.255(3) if, in the exercise of its
Page 6 of 16
XXXX 2/4/2025 2:40 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1216
1 discretion, it deems it necessary to hire a competent, qualified and independent firm
2 to assist it in reaching its decision. The issuance by the commission of a certificate
3 that public convenience and necessity require the construction of an electric
4 transmission line shall be deemed to be a determination by the commission that, as
5 of the date of issuance, the construction of the line is a prudent investment.
6 (10) The commission shall not approve any application under subsection (6) or (7) of
7 this section for the transfer of control of a utility described in KRS 278.010(3)(f)
8 unless the commission finds, in addition to findings required by those subsections,
9 that the person acquiring the utility has provided evidence of financial integrity to
10 ensure the continuity of sewage service in the event that the acquirer cannot
11 continue to provide service.
12 (11) The commission shall not accept for filing an application requesting authority to
13 abandon facilities that provide services as set forth in KRS 278.010(3)(f) or to cease
14 providing services unless the applicant has provided written notice of the filing to
15 the following:
16 (a) Kentucky Division of Water;
17 (b) Office of the Attorney General; and
18 (c) The county judge/executive, mayor, health department, planning and zoning
19 commission, and public sewage service provider of each county and each city
20 in which the utility provides utility service.
21 (12) The commission may grant any application requesting authority to abandon
22 facilities that provide services as set forth in KRS 278.010(3)(f) or to cease
23 providing services upon terms and conditions as the commission deems necessary
24 or appropriate, but not before holding a hearing on the application and no earlier
25 than ninety (90) days from the date of the commission's acceptance of the
26 application for filing, unless the commission finds it necessary for good cause to act
27 upon the application earlier.
