law and used solely in transporting school children and school employees to and from school under the
supervision and control and at the direction of school authorities, and shall further include school bus
accessory equipment and supplies and replacement equipment considered to be reasonably adaptable
for purchase from price contract agreements.
(b) The standards and specifications for accessory equipment and supplies and replacement equipment
under paragraph (a) of this subsection shall be based on federal safety standards and shall not
discriminate among manufacturers unless the Kentucky Department of Education finds evidence that a
specific manufacturer's product is defective or dangerous to use.
(c) The Kentucky Department of Education shall provide the list of standards and specifications for
accessory equipment and supplies and replacement equipment to the Finance and Administration
Cabinet for the purposes of maintaining the price contract list required under KRS 45A.489.
(2) School buses shall be clearly marked as transporting students and shall undergo a safety inspection no less
than once every thirty (30) days.
(3) (a) Districts may also use vehicles owned, leased, or contracted by the district that were designed and built
by the manufacturer for passenger transportation of nine (9) or fewer passengers, including the driver,
for transporting students to and from school and approved school activities under an alternative
transportation plan approved by the Kentucky Department of Education.
(b) Non-school bus passenger vehicles used under this subsection shall be clearly marked as transporting
students and undergo a safety inspection no less than once every thirty (30) days. However, non-school
bus passenger vehicles that are not for daily use shall not be required to be inspected more frequently
than once every three (3) months.
(c) Non-school bus passenger vehicles used under this subsection shall be operated by an employee or
contractor of a local school district that has a valid Class D operator's license. An individual that
operates a non-school bus passenger vehicle to transport a student or students without a current valid
license required by this paragraph shall be subject to the penalties set forth in KRS 156.990(4).
(d) The Kentucky Board of Education shall promulgate administrative regulations in accordance with KRS
Chapter 13A to establish:
1. Minimum standards and specifications for non-school bus passenger vehicles used under this
subsection, including a standard for minimum insurance coverage;
2. Minimum route safety standards and pick-up and drop-off protocols for pupil transportation
using non-school bus passenger vehicles that prohibit non-school bus passenger vehicles from
depositing a student at a location that would require the student to cross a road or intersection to
reach the student's destination; and
3. Minimum qualifications, training, and drug testing requirements for an individual to be
authorized to transport any student to and from school using a non-school bus passenger vehicle.
The drug testing requirements shall require an individual to submit to drug testing consistent
with the requirements of 49 C.F.R. pt. 40 to be authorized to transport students to and from
school using a non-school bus passenger vehicle.
(4) As part of its regular procedure for establishing and updating standards and specifications for school buses and
non-school bus passenger vehicles, the Kentucky Department of Education shall consider allowing school
buses to operate using clean transportation fuels, as defined in KRS 186.750. If the department determines that
school buses or non-school bus passenger vehicles may operate using clean transportation fuels while
maintaining the same or a higher degree of safety as fuels currently allowed, it shall update its standards and
specifications to allow for such use.
Section 3. Whereas achieving efficiency in pupil transportation in the Commonwealth is of paramount
importance to schools, students, and parents, an emergency is declared to exist, and this Act takes effect upon its
passage and approval by the Governor or upon its otherwise becoming a law.
Signed by Governor April 1, 2025.
