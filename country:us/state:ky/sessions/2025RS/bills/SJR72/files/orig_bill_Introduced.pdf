1 A JOINT RESOLUTION directing the Kentucky Office of the Attorney General to
2 create the Threat Response and Accountability Task Force to determine the chain of
3 command and accountability matrix for a critical incident and declaring an emergency.
4 WHEREAS, while global tensions are high and terror attacks have impacted our
5 nation in recent months, we have seen a breakdown in command and accountability
6 within our law enforcement and public protection community; and
7 WHEREAS, the command structure and accountability matrix are vital in
8 protecting against and responding to terror threats and attacks; and
9 WHEREAS, the caliber of talent and resources within our Commonwealth are vast,
10 but without a clear chain of command or accountability, the citizens are less protected
11 and vital lessons cannot be learned for future events; and
12 WHEREAS, a threat exists with the influx of illegal immigrants across our borders,
13 several of whom are on the terror watchlist and whose ideology is antithetical to our
14 nation's foundational principals; and
15 WHEREAS, the safety of the Commonwealth and its citizens is of the utmost
16 importance;
17 NOW, THEREFORE,
18 Be it resolved by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
