1 (7) Develop plans that may be required by federal legislation. The council shall for all
2 purposes of federal legislation relating to planning be considered the "single state
3 agency" as that term may be used in federal legislation. When federal legislation

5 Postsecondary Education shall establish advisory groups necessary to satisfy federal
6 legislative or regulatory guidelines;
7 (8) (a) Determine tuition and approve the minimum qualifications for admission to
8 the state postsecondary educational system. In defining residency, the council

11 met the Kentucky residency requirements at the beginning of his or her last
12 year in high school and enters a Kentucky postsecondary education institution
13 within two (2) years of high school graduation. In determining the tuition for
14 non-Kentucky residents, the council shall consider the fees required of
15 Kentucky students by institutions in adjoining states, the resident fees charged
16 by other states, the total actual per student cost of training in the institutions
17 for which the fees are being determined, and the ratios of Kentucky students
18 to non-Kentucky students comprising the enrollments of the respective
19 institutions, and other factors the council may in its sole discretion deem
20 pertinent, except that the Kentucky Community and Technical College
21 System may assess a mandatory student fee not to exceed eight dollars ($8)
22 per credit hour to be used exclusively for debt service on amounts not to
23 exceed seventy-five percent (75%) of the total projects cost of the Kentucky
24 Community and Technical College System agency bond projects included in
25 2014 Ky. Acts ch. 117, Part II, J., 11.
26 (b) The Kentucky Community and Technical College System mandatory fee
27 established in this subsection shall only be used for debt service on agency

2 (c) Any fee established as provided by this subsection shall cease to be assessed
3 upon the retirement of the project bonds for which it services debt.
4 (d) Prior to the issuance of any bonds, the Kentucky Community and Technical
5 College System shall certify in writing to the secretary of the Finance and
6 Administration Cabinet that sufficient funds have been raised to meet the
7 local match equivalent to twenty-five percent (25%) of the total project cost;
8 (9) Devise, establish, and periodically review and revise policies to be used in making
9 recommendations to the Governor for consideration in developing
10 recommendations to the General Assembly for appropriations to the universities,
11 the Kentucky Community and Technical College System, and to support strategies
12 for persons to maintain necessary levels of literacy throughout their lifetimes. The
13 council has sole discretion, with advice of the Strategic Committee on
14 Postsecondary Education and the executive officers of the postsecondary education
15 system, to devise policies that provide for allocation of funds among the
16 universities and the Kentucky Community and Technical College System;
17 (10) Lead and provide staff support for the biennial budget process as provided under

23 be on a basis consistent with the strategic agenda and the mission of the
24 respective universities and the Kentucky Community and Technical College
25 System.

25 college to meet the goal of reasonable access throughout the Commonwealth to a
26 two (2) year course of general studies designed for transfer to a baccalaureate
