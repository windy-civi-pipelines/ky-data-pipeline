3 name any suits and other legal proceedings, in this state or elsewhere, and abandon
4 the prosecution of claims he or she deems unprofitable to pursue further. If the
5 insurer is dissolved under KRS 304.33-220, he or she may apply to any court in this
6 state or elsewhere for leave to substitute himself or herself for the insurer as
7 plaintiff;

18 (18) Assert all defenses available to the insurer as against third persons, including
19 statutes of limitations, statutes of frauds, and the defense of usury. A waiver of any
20 defense by the insurer after a petition for liquidation has been filed shall not bind
21 the liquidator;
22 (19) Exercise and enforce all the rights, remedies and powers of any creditor,
23 shareholder, policyholder, or member, including any power to avoid any transfer or

7 (23) The enumeration in this section of the powers and authority of the liquidator is not a

9 not herein specifically enumerated or otherwise provided for as are necessary or
10 expedient for the accomplishment of or in aid of the purpose of liquidation.
11 Section 7. KRS 304.33-260 is amended to read as follows:
12 (1) Written notice. Every person who receives notice in the form prescribed in KRS
13 304.33-250 that an insurer for which he or she has acted as agent is the subject of a
14 liquidation order shall as soon as practicable give notice of the liquidation order.
15 The notice shall be sent by first-class mail to the last address contained in the
16 agent's records to each policyholder or other person named in any policy issued
17 through the agent by the company, if he or she has a record of the address of the
18 policyholder or other person. A policy shall be deemed issued through an agent if
19 the agent has a property interest in the expiration of the policy; or if the agent has
20 had in his or her possession a copy of the declarations of the policy at any time
21 during the life of the policy, except where the ownership of the expiration of the
22 policy has been transferred to another. The written notice shall include the name
23 and address of the insurer, the name and address of the agent, identification of the
24 policy impaired, and the nature of the impairment under KRS 304.33-210. Notice
25 by a general agent shall satisfy the notice requirement for any agents under contract
26 to him or her.
27 (2) Oral notice. So far as practicable, every insurance agent subject to subsection (1) of
Page 17 of 27
HB018420.100 - 1186 - XXXX 3/14/2025 3:59 PM Engrossed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS HB 184/EN
1 this section shall give immediate oral notice, by telephone or otherwise, of the
2 liquidation order to the same persons to whom he or she is obligated to give written
3 notice. The oral notice shall include substantially the same information as the
4 written notice.
5 (3) The liquidator may waive the duties imposed by this section if he or she determines
6 that other notice to the policyholders of the insurer under liquidation is adequate.
7 (4) Transfer of assets. Every agent subject to subsection (1) of this section shall,
8 immediately upon receiving notice pursuant to KRS 304.33-250, and not later than
9 thirty (30) days thereafter, except as otherwise[ expressly] provided under Section 3
10 of this Act or KRS 304.33-240(6), transfer all assets of the insurer in possession of
11 the agent as of the date of liquidation or any time thereafter to the liquidator. If
12 there is any dispute as to whether assets which an agent is holding are assets of the
13 insurer, the agent shall petition the court for an order determining the ownership
14 thereof.
15 Section 8. KRS 304.33-290 is amended to read as follows:
16 (1) Definition and effect. Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section and
17 Section 3 of this Act:[,]
18 (a) Every transfer made or suffered and every obligation incurred by an insurer
19 within one (1) year prior to the filing of a successful petition for rehabilitation
20 or liquidation under this subtitle shall be fraudulent as to then existing and
21 future creditors if made or incurred without fair consideration, or with actual
22 intent to hinder, delay or defraud either existing or future creditors;[. ]
23 (b) A transfer made or an obligation incurred by an insurer ordered to be
24 rehabilitated or liquidated under this subtitle, which is fraudulent under this
25 section, may be avoided by the receiver, except as to a person who in good
26 faith is a purchaser, lienor, or obligee for a present fair equivalent value; and
27 except that any purchaser, lienor, or obligee, who in good faith has given a
Page 18 of 27
HB018420.100 - 1186 - XXXX 3/14/2025 3:59 PM Engrossed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS HB 184/EN
1 consideration less than fair for such transfer, lien, or obligation, may retain the
2 property, lien, or obligation as security for repayment; and[. ]
3 (c) The court may, on due notice, order any such transfer or obligation to be
4 preserved for the benefit of the estate, and in that event the receiver shall
5 succeed to and may enforce the rights of the purchaser, lienor, or obligee.
6 (2) Perfection of transfers.
7 (a) Personal property. A transfer of property other than real property shall be
8 deemed to be made or suffered when it becomes so far perfected that no
9 subsequent lien obtainable by legal or equitable proceedings on a simple
10 contract could become superior to the rights of the transferee under subsection
11 (3) of KRS 304.33-310.
12 (b) Real property. A transfer of real property shall be deemed to be made or
13 suffered when it becomes so far perfected that no subsequent bona fide
14 purchaser from the insurer could obtain rights superior to the rights of the
15 transferee.
16 (c) Equitable liens. A transfer which creates an equitable lien shall not be deemed
17 to be perfected if there are available means by which a legal lien could be
18 created.
19 (d) Transfer not perfected prior to petition. Any transfer not perfected prior to the
20 filing of a petition for liquidation shall be deemed to be made immediately
21 before the filing of the successful petition.
22 (e) Actual creditors unnecessary. This subsection shall apply whether or not there
23 are or were creditors who might have obtained any liens or persons who might
24 have become bona fide purchasers.
25 (3) Fraudulent reinsurance transactions. Any transaction of the insurer with a reinsurer
26 shall be deemed fraudulent and may be avoided by the receiver under subsection (1)
27 of this section if:
Page 19 of 27
HB018420.100 - 1186 - XXXX 3/14/2025 3:59 PM Engrossed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS HB 184/EN
1 (a) The transaction consists of the termination, adjustment or settlement of a
2 reinsurance contract in which the reinsurer is released from any part of its
3 duty to pay the originally specified share of losses that had occurred prior to
4 the time of the transaction, unless the reinsurer gives a present fair equivalent
5 value for the release; and
6 (b) Any part of the transaction took place within one (1) year prior to the date of
7 filing of the petition through which the receivership was commenced.
8 (4) Every person receiving any property from the insurer or any benefit thereof which
9 is a fraudulent transfer under this section shall be personally liable therefor and
10 shall be bound to account to the liquidator.
11 (5) (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, any transfer of, and
12 any obligation to transfer, money or other property from an insurer-member to
13 the federal home loan bank under a federal home loan bank security, pledge,
14 collateral, or guarantee agreement, or other similar arrangement or credit
15 enhancement, shall not be deemed fraudulent and shall not be avoided by the
16 receiver under subsection (1) of this section if the agreement, arrangement, or
17 enhancement is:
18 1. Made in the ordinary course of business; and
19 2. Made in compliance with the applicable federal home loan bank
20 agreement.
21 (b) A transfer may be deemed fraudulent and may be avoided by the receiver
22 under subsection (1) of this section if the transfer is made with the intent to
23 hinder, delay, or defraud:
24 1. An insurer-member;
25 2. The receiver of the insurer-member; or
26 3. Existing or future creditors of the insurer-member.
27 Section 9. KRS 304.33-300 is amended to read as follows:

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS HB 184/EN
1 Except as provided in Section 3 of this Act:
2 (1) Effect of petition: real property. After a petition for rehabilitation or liquidation, a
3 transfer of any of the real property of the insurer made to a person acting in good
4 faith shall be valid against the receiver if made for a present fair equivalent value
5 or, if not made for a present fair equivalent value, then to the extent of the present
6 consideration actually paid therefor, for which amount the transferee shall have a
7 lien on the property so transferred. The recording of a copy of the petition for or
8 order of rehabilitation or liquidation with the county clerk in the county where any
9 real property in question is located shall be constructive notice of the
10 commencement of a proceeding in rehabilitation or liquidation. The exercise by a
11 court of the United States or any state of jurisdiction to authorize or effect a judicial
12 sale of real property of the insurer within any county in any state shall not be
13 impaired by the pendency of such a proceeding unless the copy is recorded in the
14 county prior to the consummation of the judicial sale;[.]
15 (2) Effect of petition: personal property. After a petition for rehabilitation or liquidation
16 and before either the receiver takes possession of the property of the insurer or an
17 order of rehabilitation or liquidation is granted:
18 (a) A transfer of any of the property of the insurer, other than real property, made
19 to a person acting in good faith shall be valid against the receiver if made for a
20 present fair equivalent value or, if not made for a present fair equivalent
21 value, then to the extent of the present consideration actually paid therefor, for
22 which amount the transferee shall have a lien on the property so transferred;
23 (b) A person indebted to the insurer or holding property of the insurer may, if
24 acting in good faith, pay the indebtedness or deliver the property or any part
25 thereof to the insurer or upon his or her order, with the same effect as if the
26 petition were not pending;
27 (c) A person having actual knowledge of the pending rehabilitation or liquidation
Page 21 of 27
HB018420.100 - 1186 - XXXX 3/14/2025 3:59 PM Engrossed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS HB 184/EN
1 shall be deemed not to act in good faith unless he or she has reasonable cause
2 to believe that the petition is not well founded; and
3 (d) A person asserting the validity of a transfer under this section shall have the
4 burden of proof. Except as elsewhere provided in this section, no transfer by
5 or in behalf of the insurer after the date of the petition for liquidation by any
6 person other than the liquidator shall be valid against the liquidator;[.]
7 (3) Every person receiving any property from the insurer or any benefit thereof which
8 is a fraudulent transfer under this section shall be personally liable therefor and
9 shall be bound to account to the liquidator; and[.]
10 (4) Negotiability. Nothing in this subtitle shall impair the negotiability of currency or
11 negotiable instruments.
12 Section 10. KRS 304.33-310 is amended to read as follows:
13 Except as provided in Section 3 of this Act:
14 (1) Preferences.
15 (a) Preference defined. A preference is a transfer of any of the property of an
16 insurer to or for the benefit of a creditor, for or on account of an antecedent
17 debt made or suffered by the insurer within one (1) year before the filing of a
18 successful petition for liquidation under this subtitle, the effect of which
19 transfer may be to enable the creditor to obtain a greater percentage of his or
20 her debt than another creditor of the same class would receive. If a liquidation
21 order is entered while the insurer is already subject to a rehabilitation order,
22 transfers otherwise qualifying shall be deemed preferences if made or suffered
23 within one (1) year before the filing of the successful petition for
24 rehabilitation or within two (2) years before the filing of the successful
25 petition for liquidation, whichever time is shorter.
26 (b) Invalidation of preferences. Except as provided in subsection (10) of this
27 section, any preference may be avoided by the liquidator, if:
Page 22 of 27
HB018420.100 - 1186 - XXXX 3/14/2025 3:59 PM Engrossed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS HB 184/EN
1 1. The insurer was insolvent at the time of the transfer;
2 2. The transfer was made within four (4) months before the filing of the
3 petition;
4 3. The creditor receiving it or to be benefited thereby or his or her agent
5 acting with reference thereto had reasonable cause to believe at the time
6 when the transfer was made that the insurer was insolvent or was about
7 to become insolvent; or
8 4. The creditor receiving it was an officer, employee, attorney or other
9 person who was in fact in a position of comparable influence in the
10 insurer to an officer whether or not he or she held such position, or any
11 shareholder holding directly or indirectly more than five percent (5%) of
12 any class of any equity security issued by the insurer, or any other
13 person with whom the insurer did not deal at arm's length.
14 Where the preference is voidable, the liquidator may recover the property or,
15 if it has been converted, its value from any person who has received or
16 converted the property, except a bona fide purchaser from or lienor of the
17 debtor's transferee for a present fair equivalent value. Where the bona fide
18 purchaser or lienor has given less than fair equivalent value, he or she shall
19 have a lien upon the property to the extent of the consideration actually given
20 by him or her. Where a preference by way of lien or security title is voidable,
21 the court may on due notice order the lien or title to be preserved for the
22 benefit of the estate, in which event the lien or title shall pass to the
23 liquidator;[.]
24 (2) Perfection of transfers.
25 (a) Personal property. A transfer of property other than real property is deemed to
26 be made or suffered when it becomes so far perfected that no subsequent lien
27 obtainable by legal or equitable proceedings on a simple contract could
Page 23 of 27
HB018420.100 - 1186 - XXXX 3/14/2025 3:59 PM Engrossed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS HB 184/EN
1 become superior to the rights of the transferee.
2 (b) Real property. A transfer of real property is deemed to be made or suffered
3 when it becomes so far perfected that no subsequent bona fide purchaser from
4 the insurer could obtain rights superior to the rights of transferee.
5 (c) Equitable liens. A transfer which creates an equitable lien is not deemed to be
6 perfected if there are available means by which a legal lien could be created.
7 (d) Transfers not perfected prior to petition. A transfer not perfected prior to the
8 filing of a petition for liquidation shall be deemed to be made immediately
9 before the filing of the successful petition.
10 (e) Actual creditors unnecessary. This subsection applies whether or not there
11 were creditors who might have obtained liens or persons who might have
12 become bona fide purchasers;[.]
13 (3) Liens by legal or equitable proceedings.
14 (a) Definition. A lien obtainable by legal or equitable proceedings upon a simple
15 contract is one arising in the ordinary course of such proceedings upon the
16 entry or docketing of a judgment or decree, or upon attachment, garnishment,
17 execution or like process, whether before, upon or after judgment or decree
18 and whether before or upon levy. It does not include liens which under
19 applicable law are given a special priority over other liens which are prior in
20 time.
21 (b) When liens are superior. A lien obtainable by legal or equitable proceedings
22 could become superior to the rights of a transferee, or a purchaser could
23 obtain rights superior to the rights of a transferee within the meaning of
24 subsection (2) of this section, if such consequences would follow only from
25 the lien or purchase itself, or from the lien or purchase followed by any step
26 wholly within the control of the respective lienholder or purchaser, with or
27 without the aid of ministerial action by public officials. Such a lien could not,
Page 24 of 27
HB018420.100 - 1186 - XXXX 3/14/2025 3:59 PM Engrossed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS HB 184/EN
1 however, become superior and such a purchase could not create superior
2 rights for the purpose of subsection (2) of this section through any acts
3 subsequent to the obtaining of such a lien or subsequent to such a purchase
4 which require the agreement or concurrence of any third party or which
5 require any further judicial action, or ruling;[.]
6 (4) Twenty-one day rule. A transfer of property for or on account of a new and
7 contemporaneous consideration which is deemed under subsection (2) of this
8 section to be made or suffered after the transfer because of delay in perfecting it
9 does not thereby become a transfer for or on account of an antecedent debt if any
10 acts required by the applicable law to be performed in order to perfect the transfer
11 as against liens or bona fide purchasers' rights are performed within twenty-one
12 (21) days or any period expressly allowed by the law, whichever is less. A transfer
13 to secure a future loan, if such a loan is actually made, or a transfer which becomes
14 security for a future loan shall have the same effect as a transfer for or on account
15 of a new and contemporaneous consideration;[.]
16 (5) Indemnifying transfers also voidable. If any lien deemed voidable under paragraph
17 (b) of subsection (1) of this section has been dissolved by the furnishing of a bond
18 or other obligation, the surety on which has been indemnified directly or indirectly
19 by the transfer of or the creation of a lien upon any property of an insurer before the
20 filing of a petition under this subtitle which results in a liquidation order, the
21 indemnifying transfer or lien shall also be deemed voidable;[.]
22 (6) Avoidance of lien. The property affected by any lien deemed voidable under
23 paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of this section and subsection (5) of this section is
24 discharged from the lien, and that property and any of the indemnifying property
25 transferred to or for the benefit of a surety shall pass to the liquidator, except that
26 the court may on due notice order the lien to be preserved for the benefit of the
27 estate and the court may direct that a conveyance be executed which is adequate to
Page 25 of 27

1 evidence the title of the liquidator;[.]
2 (7) Hearings to determine rights. The court shall have summary jurisdiction of any
3 proceeding by the liquidator to hear and determine the rights of any parties under
4 this section. Reasonable notice of any hearing in the proceeding shall be given to all
5 parties in interest, including the obligee of a releasing bond or other like obligation.
6 Where an order is entered for the recovery of indemnifying property in kind or for
7 the avoidance of an indemnifying lien, the court, upon application of any party in
8 interest, shall in the same proceeding ascertain the value of the property or lien, and
9 if the value is less than the amount for which the property is indemnity or than the
10 amount of the lien, the transferee or lienholder may elect to retain the property or
11 lien upon payment of its value, as ascertained by the court, to the liquidator within
12 such reasonable times as the court fixes;[.]
13 (8) Surety's liability discharged. The liability of a surety under a releasing bond or
14 other like obligation shall be discharged to the extent of the value of the
15 indemnifying property recovered or the indemnifying lien nullified and avoided or,
16 where the property is retained under subsection (7) of this section to the extent of
17 the amount paid to the liquidator;[.]
18 (9) Setoff of new advances. If a creditor has been preferred and afterward in good faith
19 gives the insurer further credit without security of any kind, for property which
20 becomes a part of the insurer's estate, the amount of the new credit remaining
21 unpaid at the time of the petition may be set off against the preference which would
22 otherwise be recoverable from him or her; and[.]
23 (10) Federal home loan bank preferences. A liquidator shall not avoid any preference
24 arising under, or in connection with, a federal home loan bank security agreement
25 or any pledge agreement, security agreement, collateral agreement, guarantee
26 agreement, or other similar arrangement or credit enhancement relating to a security
27 agreement to which a federal home loan bank is a party.

2 (1) Set-offs allowed in general. Mutual debt or mutual credits between the insurer and
3 another person in connection with any action or proceeding under this subtitle shall
4 be set off and the balance only shall be allowed or paid, except as provided in
5 subsection (2) of this section.
6 (2) Exceptions. Except as provided in Section 3 of this Act, no set-off or counterclaim
7 shall be allowed in favor of any person where:
8 (a) The obligation of the insurer to the person would not at the date of the filing
9 of a petition for liquidation entitle him or her to share as a claimant in the
10 assets of the insurer;
11 (b) The obligation of the insurer to the person was purchased by or transferred to
12 the person with a view to its being used as a set-off;
13 (c) The obligation of the person is to pay an assessment levied against the
14 members or subscribers of the insurer, or is to pay a balance upon a
15 subscription to the capital stock of the insurer, or is in any other way in the
16 nature of a capital contribution; or
17 (d) The obligation of the person is to pay earned premiums to the insurer.
18 However, the provisions of this paragraph shall only apply to reinsurance
19 contracts entered into prior to July 13, 2004.
