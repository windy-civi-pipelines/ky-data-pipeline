6 Section 4. KRS 532.025 is amended to read as follows:
7 (1) (a) Upon conviction of a defendant in cases where the death penalty may be
8 imposed, a hearing shall be conducted. In such hearing, the judge shall hear
9 additional evidence in extenuation, mitigation, and aggravation of
10 punishment, including the record of any prior criminal convictions and pleas
11 of guilty or pleas of nolo contendere of the defendant, or the absence of any
12 prior conviction and pleas; provided, however, that only such evidence in
13 aggravation as the state has made known to the defendant prior to his or her
14 trial shall be admissible. Subject to the Kentucky Rules of Evidence, juvenile
15 court records of adjudications of guilt of a child for an offense that would be a
16 felony if committed by an adult shall be admissible in court at any time the
17 child is tried as an adult, or after the child becomes an adult, at any
18 subsequent criminal trial relating to that same person. Juvenile court records
19 made available pursuant to this section may be used for impeachment
20 purposes during a criminal trial and may be used during the sentencing phase
21 of a criminal trial; however, the fact that a juvenile has been adjudicated
22 delinquent of an offense that would be a felony if the child had been an adult
23 shall not be used in finding the child to be a persistent felony offender based
24 upon that adjudication. Release of the child's treatment, medical, mental, or
25 psychological records is prohibited unless presented as evidence in Circuit
26 Court. Release of any records resulting from the child's prior abuse and
27 neglect under Title IV-E or IV-B of the Federal Social Security Act is also
Page 3 of 7

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1139
1 prohibited. The judge shall also hear argument by the defendant or his or her
2 counsel and the prosecuting attorney, as provided by law, regarding the
3 punishment to be imposed. The prosecuting attorney shall open and the
4 defendant shall conclude the argument. In cases in which the death penalty
5 may be imposed, the judge when sitting without a jury shall follow the
6 additional procedure provided in subsection (2) of this section. Upon the
7 conclusion of the evidence and arguments, the judge shall impose the sentence
8 or shall recess the trial for the purpose of taking the sentence within the limits
9 prescribed by law. If the trial court is reversed on appeal because of error only
10 in the presentence hearing, the new trial which may be ordered shall apply
11 only to the issue of punishment.
12 (b) In all cases in which the death penalty may be imposed and which are tried by
13 a jury, upon a return of a verdict of guilty by the jury, the court shall resume
14 the trial and conduct a presentence hearing before the jury. Such hearing shall
15 be conducted in the same manner as presentence hearings conducted before
16 the judge as provided in paragraph (a) of this subsection, including the record
17 of any prior criminal convictions and pleas of guilty or pleas of nolo
18 contendere of the defendant. Upon the conclusion of the evidence and
19 arguments, the judge shall give the jury appropriate instructions, and the jury
20 shall retire to determine whether any mitigating or aggravating circumstances,
21 as defined in subsection (2) of this section, exist and to recommend a sentence
22 for the defendant. Upon the findings of the jury, the judge shall fix a sentence
23 within the limits prescribed by law.
24 (2) In all cases of offenses for which the death penalty may be authorized, the judge
25 shall consider, or include in his or her instructions to the jury for it to consider, any
26 mitigating circumstances or aggravating circumstances otherwise authorized by law
27 and any of the following statutory aggravating or mitigating circumstances which

Page 5 of 7
XXXX 1/9/2025 10:18 AM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1139
1 or a domestic violence order was in effect, or when any other order
2 designed to protect the victim from the offender, such as an order issued
3 as a condition of a bond, conditional release, probation, parole, or

5 9. The offender's act of killing was intentional and resulted in the death of
6 a child under twelve (12) years old; and

10 (b) Mitigating circumstances:
11 1. The defendant has no significant history of prior criminal activity;
12 2. The capital offense was committed while the defendant was under the
13 influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance even though the

16 3. The victim was a participant in the defendant's criminal conduct or
17 consented to the criminal act;
18 4. The capital offense was committed under circumstances which the
19 defendant believed to provide a moral justification or extenuation for his

1 sufficient to constitute a defense to the crime;
2 7. At the time of the capital offense, the capacity of the defendant to
3 appreciate the criminality of his or her conduct to the requirements of
4 law was impaired as a result of mental illness or an intellectual disability
5 or intoxication even though the impairment of the capacity of the
6 defendant to appreciate the criminality of his or her conduct or to
7 conform the conduct to the requirements of law is insufficient to
8 constitute a defense to the crime; and
9 8. The youth of the defendant at the time of the crime.
10 (3) The instructions as determined by the trial judge to be warranted by the evidence or
11 as required by KRS 532.030(4) shall be given in charge and in writing to the jury
12 for its deliberation. The jury, if its verdict be a recommendation of death, or
13 imprisonment for life without benefit of probation or parole, or imprisonment for
14 life without benefit of probation or parole until the defendant has served a minimum
15 of twenty-five (25) years of his or her sentence, shall designate in writing, signed by
16 the foreman of the jury, the aggravating circumstance or circumstances which it
17 found beyond a reasonable doubt. In nonjury cases, the judge shall make such
18 designation. In all cases unless at least one (1) of the statutory aggravating
19 circumstances enumerated in subsection (2) of this section is so found, the death
20 penalty, or imprisonment for life without benefit of probation or parole, or the
21 sentence to imprisonment for life without benefit of probation or parole until the
22 defendant has served a minimum of twenty-five (25) years of his or her sentence,

7 (1) (a) Upon conviction of a defendant in cases where the death penalty may be

6 additional procedure provided in subsection (2) of this section. Upon the
7 conclusion of the evidence and arguments, the judge shall impose the sentence
8 or shall recess the trial for the purpose of taking the sentence within the limits
9 prescribed by law. If the trial court is reversed on appeal because of error only
10 in the presentence hearing, the new trial which may be ordered shall apply
11 only to the issue of punishment.
12 (b) In all cases in which the death penalty may be imposed and which are tried by
13 a jury, upon a return of a verdict of guilty by the jury, the court shall resume
14 the trial and conduct a presentence hearing before the jury. Such hearing shall

16 the judge as provided in paragraph (a) of this subsection, including the record
