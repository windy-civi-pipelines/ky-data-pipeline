12 (2) Prior to the master commissioner's setting each parcel for sale pursuant to court

14 recent certified tax assessment of each parcel to be sold. The most recent certified
15 assessment of a property shall be the property valuation administrator's last

17 county clerk, as required by KRS 133.180.
18 (3) The most recent certified assessment as sworn to in the affidavit furnished by the

5 (1) Any suit to collect delinquent tax bills which may be pending at the time of the
6 commencement of any suit brought under Sections 2 to 20 of this Act, affecting
7 the same land, shall be consolidated with the suit brought under Sections 2 to 20
8 of this Act. The parties to the pending suit shall file answers, but any tax bill
9 sought to be collected in any pending suit may be included in any list included as
10 a part of any petition filed by the county. If so included, the inclusion shall act as
11 an abatement of any pending suit, and all amounts then due on any tax bill,

13 continue in force the liens against the respective parcel of real estate listed in the
14 petition filed under Sections 2 to 20 of this Act.
15 (2) Any suit described in subsection (1) of this section shall be tried as all other

17 suit from asserting all rights and defenses which they then have.
18 (3) Any cross-claim of a taxing authority under Sections 2 to 20 of this Act may

1 brought, together with interest, penalties, and court costs computed as of the date of the
2 judgment. The court may decree that the lien upon the parcel of real estate described in
3 the tax bill be enforced and the real estate be sold by the master commissioner and the
4 cost continued for further proceedings as provided by Sections 2 to 20 of this Act.
5 SECTION 15. A NEW SECTION OF KRS CHAPTER 68 IS CREATED TO
6 READ AS FOLLOWS:
7 (1) At any time prior to the sale of the property, any person having any right, title, or
8 interest in, or lien upon, any parcel of real estate described in the petition may
9 discharge any county lien or satisfy a judgment in favor of the county as to the
10 parcel of real estate by paying to the county all of the sums mentioned therein,
11 including the principal, interest, penalties, and costs then due.
12 (2) If the property is sold pursuant to the judgment or order of the court and does not
13 bring its most recent assessed value certified by the Department of Revenue to the
14 county clerk as required by KRS 133.180, the owner may redeem it within sixty
15 (60) days from the day of the sale by paying the purchaser the original purchase
16 money and interest at eighteen percent (18%) per annum. Any owner who
17 redeems his or her land shall take a receipt from the purchaser and lodge it with
18 the clerk of the court. The receipt shall be entered upon the records of the court.
19 (3) The owner may tender the redemption money to the purchaser or the purchaser's
20 agent or attorney, if found in the county where the land lies or in the county in
21 which the judgment was obtained or order of sale made. If the money is refused,
22 or if the purchaser does not reside in either of the counties, the owner may,
23 before the expiration of the right of redemption, go to the clerk of the court in
24 which the judgment was rendered or the order made, and make affidavit of the
25 tender and refusal, or that the purchaser or his or her agent or attorney do not
26 reside in either of the counties. The owner may then pay to the clerk the
27 redemption money, and the clerk shall give receipt therefor and file the affidavit

1 among the papers of the action.
2 (4) When the right of redemption exists, the owner may remain in possession of the
3 property until it expires. Real property sold shall not be conveyed to the purchaser
4 until the right of redemption has expired. If it is redeemed, the sale shall, from
5 and after the redemption or from and after the deposit of the redemption money
6 with the clerk, be null and void.
7 (5) In the event of failure to redeem within the period provided for redemption, the
8 owner or any other party in interest shall be barred forever of all right, title, and
9 interest in and to the parcel of real estate described in the petition.
10 (6) Upon redemption as permitted by this section, the person redeeming shall be
11 entitled to a certificate of redemption from the county describing the property in
12 the same manner as it is described in the petition and the county shall thereupon
13 note on his or her records the word "redeemed" and the date of the payment
14 opposite the description of the parcel of real estate.
15 SECTION 16. A NEW SECTION OF KRS CHAPTER 68 IS CREATED TO
16 READ AS FOLLOWS:
17 (1) Upon the confirmation of the sale by the court and the expiration of the right of
18 redemption provided in Section 15 of this Act, the title to any real estate
19 purchased from the master commissioner under Sections 2 to 20 of this Act shall
20 vest in the purchaser. The title of the real estate shall be an absolute estate in fee
21 simple, subject to rights-of-way of public utilities on which tax has been otherwise
22 paid and subject to any right of redemption of the United States of America, if
23 any. All persons, including the Commonwealth of Kentucky, infants,
24 incompetents, absentees, and nonresidents who may have had any right, title,
25 interest, claim, or equity of redemption in or to, or lien upon the land shall be
26 barred of all right, title, interest, claim, lien, or equity of redemption, and the
27 court shall order that immediate possession of the real estate be given to the

1 purchaser. Any person so barred shall thereafter have as his or her exclusive
2 remedy a claim for a share of the proceeds of the sale of the real estate by the
3 master commissioner.
4 (2) The title shall be subject to the liens of any tax bill which may have attached to
5 the parcel of real estate prior to the time of the filing of the petition affecting the
6 parcel of real estate not then delinquent, or which may have attached after the
7 filing of the petition and prior to the expiration of the period provided for
8 redemption and not including any answer to the petition.
9 (3) If the parcel of real estate is sold to the county or to a land bank authority created
10 under KRS 65.350 to 65.375, the title shall be free of any liens to the extent of the
11 interest of any taxing authority in any of the real estate.
12 (4) The title shall not be subject to the lien of special tax bills, which have attached to
13 the parcel of real estate, but the lien of the special tax bill shall attach to the
14 proceeds of the master commissioner's sale or to the proceeds of the ultimate sale
15 of the parcel by the county.
16 (5) Failure of any party other than the purchaser to follow the procedures set out in
17 Sections 2 to 20 of this Act shall not affect the vesting of title in the purchaser.
18 SECTION 17. A NEW SECTION OF KRS CHAPTER 68 IS CREATED TO

20 (1) After the master commissioner sells any parcel of real estate, the court shall,
21 upon its own motion or upon motion of any interested party, set the cause down
22 for hearing to confirm the sale, even though the parcels are not all of the parcels
23 of real estate described in the notice of the master commissioner's sale.
24 (2) If the sale is confirmed, the court shall order the proceeds of the sale applied in
25 the following order:
26 (a) To the payment of all costs, including court costs, publication costs, and
27 costs otherwise associated with the action and sale of the parcel described in

1 the particular count; and
2 (b) To the payment of all tax bills on the property, including principal, interest,
3 and penalties. If after the payment there is any sum remaining of the
4 proceeds of the commissioner's sale of the property, the court shall try and
5 determine the other issues in the suit with respect to that particular count. If
6 any of the answering parties has specifically appealed, the court, provided
7 that the answering parties have, prior to the appeal, executed an appropriate
8 supersedeas bond, shall retain custody of the funds pending disposition of
9 the appeal, and upon disposition of the appeal shall make distribution. If
10 there are not sufficient proceeds of the sale to pay all claims in any class
11 described, the court shall order them to be paid in accordance with the
12 priorities.
13 (3) If there are any funds remaining of the proceeds after the commissioner's sale
14 and after the distribution of the funds as set out in this section and no person
15 entitled to any funds, whether or not a party to the suit, shall have appeared
16 within two (2) years after the sale and claimed the funds, the funds shall escheat
17 to the state as provided in KRS Chapter 393.

25 necessity for giving bond and the provisions thereof shall be the same as in the case of
26 appeal from the judgment of sale.
