1 (4) School personnel or other persons listed in KRS 620.030(2) do not have the
2 authority to conduct internal investigations in lieu of the official investigations
3 outlined in this section.
4 (5) (a) If, after receiving the report, the law enforcement officer, the cabinet, or its
5 designated representative cannot gain admission to the location of the child, a
6 search warrant shall be requested from, and may be issued by, the judge to the
7 appropriate law enforcement official upon probable cause that the child is
8 dependent, neglected, or abused. If, pursuant to a search under a warrant, a
9 child is discovered and appears to be in imminent danger, the child may be
10 removed by the law enforcement officer.
11 (b) If a child who is in a hospital or under the immediate care of a physician
12 appears to be in imminent danger if he or she is returned to the persons having
13 custody of him or her, the physician or hospital administrator may hold the
14 child without court order, provided that a request is made to the court for an
15 emergency custody order at the earliest practicable time, not to exceed
16 seventy-two (72) hours.
17 (c) Any appropriate law enforcement officer may take a child into protective
18 custody and may hold that child in protective custody without the consent of
19 the parent or other person exercising custodial control or supervision if there
20 exist reasonable grounds for the officer to believe that the child is in danger of
21 imminent death or serious physical injury, is being sexually abused, or is a
22 victim of human trafficking and that the parents or other person exercising
23 custodial control or supervision are unable or unwilling to protect the child.
24 The officer or the person to whom the officer entrusts the child shall, within
25 twelve (12) hours of taking the child into protective custody, request the court
26 to issue an emergency custody order.

1 child into custody without the consent of the parent or other person exercising
2 custodial control or supervision, he or she shall provide written notice to the
3 parent or other person stating the reasons for removal of the child. Failure of
4 the parent or other person to receive notice shall not, by itself, be cause for
5 civil or criminal liability.
6 (e) 1. If a report includes a child fatality or near fatality, and the law
7 enforcement officer has reasonable grounds to believe any parent or
8 person exercising custodial control or supervision of the child was under
9 the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time the fatality or near fatality
10 occurred, the law enforcement officer shall request a test of blood,
11 breath, or urine from that person.
12 2. If, after making the request, consent is not given for the test of blood,
13 breath, or urine, a search warrant shall be requested from and may be
14 issued by the judge to the appropriate law enforcement official upon
15 probable cause that a child fatality or near fatality has occurred and that
16 the person exercising custodial control or supervision of the child at the
17 time of the fatality or near fatality was under the influence.
18 3. Any test requested under this section shall be conducted pursuant to the
19 testing procedures and requirements in KRS 189A.103.

24 notify the Department of Defense family advocacy program operating within the
25 service member's assigned installation of the investigation or assessment and
