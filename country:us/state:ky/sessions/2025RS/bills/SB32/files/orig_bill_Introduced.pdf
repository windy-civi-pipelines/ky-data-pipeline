4 (1) The Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority is hereby authorized to
5 develop and fund a small business loan program to assist new or existing small
6 businesses operating in the Commonwealth. The authority may lend up to one
7 hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) to any eligible small business for acquisition,
8 construction, expansion, working capital, or any other business expense the
9 authority deems reasonable to approve.
10 (2) The authority shall determine the terms, conditions, and requirements for loans
11 issued under this section, including collateral requirements when deemed
12 reasonable and appropriate. Recognizing that small businesses, while essential for
13 the economic vitality of the Commonwealth, may have difficulty obtaining
14 conventional loans, the authority may provide terms that are more lenient, high-risk,
15 less secure, or otherwise less stringent than industry standards.
16 (3) To be eligible for a loan under this section, a small business shall be engaged in
17 manufacturing, agribusiness, or service or technology, shall not be engaged
18 primarily in retail, and shall commit to creating and maintaining at least one (1)
19 new full-time job above the number existing on the date of application.
20 (4) The authority shall develop criteria to evaluate loan applications that give
21 investment preference to businesses that:
22 (a) Employ veterans at a rate of no less than twenty-five percent (25%) of the
23 business's total number of employees; or
24 (b) Are veteran-owned businesses, as defined in KRS 14A.1-070.
25 The authority shall use these criteria to make all reasonable efforts to direct at
26 least seven percent (7%) of loaned funds each year to these businesses, provided
27 that the authority receives qualified applications from these businesses that
