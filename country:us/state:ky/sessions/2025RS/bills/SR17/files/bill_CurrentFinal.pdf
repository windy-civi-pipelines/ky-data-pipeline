2 Awareness Month.
3 WHEREAS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), known by many as Lou Gehrig's

8 away from ALS; and
9 WHEREAS, on average, patients diagnosed with ALS only survive two to five
10 years from the time of diagnosis; and
11 WHEREAS, ALS has no cure; and
12 WHEREAS, people who have served in the military are more likely to develop
13 ALS and die from the disease than those with no history of military service; and
14 WHEREAS, securing access to new therapies, durable equipment, and
15 communication technologies are of vital importance to people living with ALS; and
16 WHEREAS, clinical trials play a pivotal role in evaluating new treatments,
17 enhancing quality of life, and fostering assistive technologies for those living with ALS;
18 and
19 WHEREAS, the 11th anniversary of the Ice Bucket Challenge will be celebrated
20 this summer with a renewed commitment to galvanize public awareness and support
21 funding leading to significant investments in ALS research; and

24 across the United States and 18 other countries; and
25 WHEREAS, the ALS Association's commitment to accelerating the pace of
26 discovery remains unwavering, fueled by the hope that one day, ALS will be a livable
