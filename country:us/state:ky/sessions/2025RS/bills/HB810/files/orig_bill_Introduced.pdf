1 AN ACT relating to minimum staffing requirements for long-term care facilities.
2 WHEREAS, long-term care facilities have an insufficient number of direct-care
3 staff, including nurse aides, registered nurses, and licensed practical nurses; and
4 WHEREAS, Kentucky currently follows the federal staffing standards, which
5 require one registered nurse on duty for eight consecutive hours per day for seven days
6 per week and one registered nurse or licensed practical nurse on duty for 24 hours per day
7 for seven days a week, but Kentucky does not have staffing requirements in long-term
8 care facilities that go beyond these requirements; and
9 WHEREAS, federal staffing standards do not require a minimum level of staff that
10 are nurse aides; and
11 WHEREAS, having too few nurse aides compromises patient safety and places
12 residents at risk for health conditions and injuries, including but not limited to bedsores,
13 dehydration, malnutrition, and broken bones from falls; and
14 WHEREAS, Kentucky can improve the safety of residents of long-term care
15 facilities by requiring a specified staff-to-resident ratio that exceeds the federal minimum
16 staffing standards; and
17 WHEREAS, it is in the best interests of the citizens of the Commonwealth for the
18 General Assembly to require long-term care facilities to maintain a specified staff-to-
19 resident ratio that exceeds the federal staffing standards and improves access to better
20 care to patients in need of long-term care services;
21 NOW, THEREFORE,
22 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
