(6) "New teacher" means any member not a present teacher;
(7) "Prior service" means the number of years during which the member was a teacher in Kentucky prior to July 1,
1941, except that not more than thirty (30) years' prior service shall be allowed or credited to any teacher;

of the five (5) years of highest salaries as defined in KRS 61.680(2)(a), which shall include picked-up member
contributions. Additionally, the board of trustees may approve a final average salary based upon the average of
the three (3) highest salaries for individuals who become members prior to January 1, 2022, who are at least
fifty-five (55) years of age and have a minimum of twenty-seven (27) years of Kentucky service credit.
However, if any of the five (5) or three (3) highest annual salaries used to calculate the final average salary
was paid within the three (3) years immediately prior to the date of the member's retirement for individuals
who become members prior to January 1, 2022, or within the five (5) years immediately prior to the date of the
member's retirement for individuals who become members on or after January 1, 2022, the amount of salary to

final average salary shall be limited to the lesser of:
(a) The member's actual salary; or
(b) The member's annual salary that was used for retirement purposes during each of the prior three (3)

received by all other members employed by the public board, institution, or agency, or for members of
school districts, the highest percentage increase received by members on any one (1) rank and step of
the salary schedule of the school district. The increase shall be computed on the salary that was used for
retirement purposes. The board of trustees may promulgate an administrative regulation in accordance
with KRS Chapter 13A to establish a methodology for measuring the limitation so that the combined
increases in salary for each of the last three (3) full years of salary prior to retirement shall not exceed
the total permissible percentage increase received by other members of the employer for the same three
(3) year period.
For individuals who became members of the retirement system prior to July 1, 2021, this limitation shall not
apply if the member receives an increase in salary in a percentage exceeding that received by the other
members, and this increase was accompanied by a corresponding change in position or in length of
employment. The board of trustees may promulgate an administrative regulation in accordance with KRS
Chapter 13A to provide definitions for a corresponding change in position or in length of employment. This
limitation shall also not apply to the payment to a member for accrued annual leave if the individual becomes a
member before July 1, 2008, or accrued sick leave which is authorized by statute and which shall, for
individuals subject to KRS 161.155(10) who became nonuniversity members of the system prior to January 1,

not include payment for any benefit or salary adjustments made by the public board, institution, or agency to

members employed by that public board, institution, or agency. Annual compensation shall not include the
salary supplement received by a member under KRS 157.197(2)(c), 158.6455, or 158.782 on or after July 1,

Section 3:
1996. Under no circumstances shall annual compensation include compensation that is earned by a member
while on assignment to an organization or agency that is not a public board, institution, or agency listed in
subsection (4) of this section. In the event that federal law requires that a member continue membership in the
retirement system even though the member is on assignment to an organization or agency that is not a public
board, institution, or agency listed in subsection (4) of this section, the member's annual compensation for
retirement purposes shall be deemed to be the annual compensation, as limited by subsection (9) of this

Section 4:
section, last earned by the member while still employed solely by and providing services directly to a public
board, institution, or agency listed in subsection (4) of this section. The board of trustees shall determine if any
benefit or salary adjustment qualifies as annual compensation. For an individual who becomes a member on or
after July 1, 2008, annual compensation shall not include lump-sum payments upon termination of
employment for accumulated annual or compensatory leave;
(11) "Age of member" means the age attained on the first day of the month immediately following the birthdate of

for service in a covered position and on which the member has made contributions, or on which the public
board, institution, or agency has picked-up member contributions pursuant to KRS 161.540(2), or the average
of the five (5) years of highest salaries as defined in KRS 61.680(2)(a), which shall include picked-up member
contributions. Additionally, the board of trustees may approve a final average salary based upon the average of
the three (3) highest salaries for individuals who become members prior to January 1, 2022, who are at least
fifty-five (55) years of age and have a minimum of twenty-seven (27) years of Kentucky service credit.
However, if any of the five (5) or three (3) highest annual salaries used to calculate the final average salary
was paid within the three (3) years immediately prior to the date of the member's retirement for individuals
who become members prior to January 1, 2022, or within the five (5) years immediately prior to the date of the
member's retirement for individuals who become members on or after January 1, 2022, the amount of salary to

final average salary shall be limited to the lesser of:
(a) The member's actual salary; or
(b) The member's annual salary that was used for retirement purposes during each of the prior three (3)

received by all other members employed by the public board, institution, or agency, or for members of
school districts, the highest percentage increase received by members on any one (1) rank and step of
the salary schedule of the school district. The increase shall be computed on the salary that was used for
retirement purposes. The board of trustees may promulgate an administrative regulation in accordance
with KRS Chapter 13A to establish a methodology for measuring the limitation so that the combined
increases in salary for each of the last three (3) full years of salary prior to retirement shall not exceed
the total permissible percentage increase received by other members of the employer for the same three
(3) year period.
For individuals who became members of the retirement system prior to July 1, 2021, this limitation shall not
apply if the member receives an increase in salary in a percentage exceeding that received by the other
members, and this increase was accompanied by a corresponding change in position or in length of
employment. The board of trustees may promulgate an administrative regulation in accordance with KRS
Chapter 13A to provide definitions for a corresponding change in position or in length of employment. This

individuals subject to KRS 161.155(10) who became nonuniversity members of the system prior to January 1,

members employed by that public board, institution, or agency. Annual compensation shall not include the
salary supplement received by a member under KRS 157.197(2)(c), 158.6455, or 158.782 on or after July 1,
1996. Under no circumstances shall annual compensation include compensation that is earned by a member
while on assignment to an organization or agency that is not a public board, institution, or agency listed in
subsection (4) of this section. In the event that federal law requires that a member continue membership in the
retirement system even though the member is on assignment to an organization or agency that is not a public
board, institution, or agency listed in subsection (4) of this section, the member's annual compensation for
retirement purposes shall be deemed to be the annual compensation, as limited by subsection (9) of this
section, last earned by the member while still employed solely by and providing services directly to a public
board, institution, or agency listed in subsection (4) of this section. The board of trustees shall determine if any
benefit or salary adjustment qualifies as annual compensation. For an individual who becomes a member on or

employment for accumulated annual or compensatory leave;
(11) "Age of member" means the age attained on the first day of the month immediately following the birthdate of
