1 A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION commemorating the 75th anniversary of the
2 Sport Fish Restoration Program as part of the American System of Conservation
3 Funding.
4 WHEREAS, more than a century ago, hunters and anglers were among the first
5 conservationists who realized America's natural resources were in peril and could not
6 sustain unregulated harvest and habitat destruction; and
7 WHEREAS, sportsmen and sportswomen took it upon themselves to support laws
8 that stopped the excessive harvest of fish and wildlife, established state agencies to
9 protect fish, wildlife, and their habitat, and advocated for special fishing and hunting
10 license fees to fund the new agencies' efforts to provide healthy natural resources for
11 future generations; and
12 WHEREAS, the primary authority to protect and manage fish within state waters
13 resides with state agencies; and
14 WHEREAS, realizing that license fees alone were insufficient to fund the
15 restoration and maintenance of healthy fish populations, anglers supported excise taxes
16 on fishing equipment to raise additional funds to support restoration and enhancement
17 efforts of the state agencies; and
18 WHEREAS, the Sport Fish Restoration Program, which is a vital part of
19 conservation funding in the United States, began 75 years ago with the passage of the
20 Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Act in 1950; and
21 WHEREAS, the program was expanded in 1984 after the passage of the Wallop-
22 Breaux amendment to the Sport Fish Restoration Act; and
23 WHEREAS, a manufacturer's excise tax on fishing equipment, along with an excise
24 tax on motorboat and small engine fuels, is mostly distributed back to the states through
25 the United States Fish and Wildlife Service for fisheries conservation, management, and
26 angler and boater access; and
27 WHEREAS, this cooperative partnership between the sportfishing industry, anglers,

1 boaters, state natural resource agencies, and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service
2 has resulted in the most successful model of fisheries management in the world, restoring
3 and enhancing fish populations across the United States and its territories; and
4 WHEREAS, since 1939, the combined contribution of the Wildlife and Sport Fish
5 Restoration Programs and license fees to the state fish and wildlife agencies exceeds $78
6 billion dollars which is more than any other single conservation effort in American
7 history and constitutes, collectively, the American system of conservation funding;
8 NOW, THEREFORE,
9 Be it resolved by the Senate of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of
10 Kentucky, the House of Representatives concurring therein:
11 Section 1. The General Assembly recognizes America's anglers and boaters, the
12 sportfishing industry, state fish and wildlife agencies, and the United States Fish and
13 Wildlife Service for their leading role in restoring healthy populations of fish and aquatic
14 resources, both game and non-game, to the abundance we see today, and with the help of
15 the Sport Fish Restoration Program, in this 75th year of the program's establishment that
16 is the model for the American system of conservation funding.
17 Section 2. The Clerk of the Senate is directed to transmit a copy of this
18 Resolution to the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources and the offices of
19 the members of Kentucky's congressional delegation. Those receiving this Resolution are
20 encouraged to further its dissemination to local, regional, and national medial sources so
21 that all may know and appreciate the foresight and contributions from anglers, the
22 sportfishing industry, state fish and wildlife agencies, and the United States Fish and
23 Wildlife Service on behalf of our nation's fisheries and aquatic resources.
