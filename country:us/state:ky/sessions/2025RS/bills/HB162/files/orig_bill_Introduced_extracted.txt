UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 464
1 district's projected tax assessments to the originating district's overall tax

4 liabilities for each district;
5 (f) Until the transfer of assets and liabilities outlined in subsection (8) of this

12 altered originating district's use of these funds shall require approval of the
13 department. Any new debt acquired by the altered originating district shall
14 not be assigned to the new independent district; and
15 (g) Prior to the deadline for the new independent district to be fully operational
16 established in subsection (4)(h) of Section 4 of this Act, as the altered
17 originating district continues to make any payments on debts of the
18 originating district, the amounts shall be attributed in the same proportional
19 manner as in paragraph (e) of this subsection.

16 commissioner of education or designee for resolution pursuant to subsection (6)
17 of this section. Any proposed agreement to the division of the originating district's
18 assets shall be agreed to by a majority vote of each district's board of education.
19 (6) On issues the boards cannot come to agreement under subsection (4) or (5) of
20 this section, a board may appeal to the commissioner of education or designee to
21 determine an equitable resolution of the disagreement. In any determination, the
22 decision shall prioritize the successful operation of both districts. The matter
23 shall be decided within thirty (30) days of the submission. The commissioner or
24 designee shall notify the districts of the decision. The decisions may be appealed
25 to the Kentucky Board of Education at its next regular meeting.

8 section shall be determined and completed.
9 (9) The altered originating district shall continue to exercise taxing authority over
10 both the altered originating district and the new independent district and shall
11 collect revenues in the same manner as the originating district. For the tax year
12 in which the deadline to be fully operational established in subsection (4)(h) of
13 Section 4 of this Act occurs, the amounts collected by the altered originating
14 district shall first be divided by two (2). The quotient shall then be distributed
15 proportionally between the two districts in the same manner as in subsection
16 (3)(e) of this section. Upon the close of that tax year, the new independent district

Page 6 of 18
XXXX 1/4/2025 11:05 AM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 464
1 its members reside in the new independent district, then representation of over-

12 (a) The calculation shall be an amount in dollars for both total assets and total
13 liabilities;
14 (b) The department shall develop a list of assets and liabilities and the values
15 assigned to each. Classes of individual items may collectively be given an
16 assigned value based on an average valuation;
17 (c) The assets shall exclude:
18 1. Any federal funds or grant funds given to the originating district when
19 division would violate restrictions or conditions of the funds; and
20 2. Any property purchased with funds when division would violate

23 including debt for construction or the purchase of equipment for the

25 (e) The department shall then calculate the projected tax assessments for both

Page 7 of 18
XXXX 1/4/2025 11:05 AM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 464
1 district's projected tax assessments to the originating district's overall tax
2 assessments, the department shall assign an amount in dollars of both
3 assets and liabilities. These shall be the initial assigned value of assets and
4 liabilities for each district;
5 (f) Until the transfer of assets and liabilities outlined in subsection (8) of this
6 section, and excluding any required funds transferred in Section 4 of this
7 Act, the altered originating district shall maintain control and use of all the
8 assets and shall be responsible for their maintenance. An amount of assets
9 assigned to the new independent district in paragraph (e) of this subsection
10 shall be restricted and shall only be used, disposed of, or expended to
11 provide essential education services for currently enrolled students. The
12 altered originating district's use of these funds shall require approval of the
13 department. Any new debt acquired by the altered originating district shall
14 not be assigned to the new independent district; and
15 (g) Prior to the deadline for the new independent district to be fully operational
16 established in subsection (4)(h) of Section 4 of this Act, as the altered
17 originating district continues to make any payments on debts of the
18 originating district, the amounts shall be attributed in the same proportional
19 manner as in paragraph (e) of this subsection.
20 (4) The interim board of education of the new independent district and the board of
21 education of the altered originating district shall conduct negotiations to agree to
22 the division of the originating district's assets and liabilities. Each district shall be
23 entitled to an amount of assets assigned by the department under subsection (3)
24 of this section. The negotiation shall resolve:
25 (a) The disposition of any of the originating district's real properties and
26 buildings that are located within the boundaries of the new independent
27 district;
Page 8 of 18

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 464
1 (b) The division of any monies held by or owed to the originating district;
2 (c) The specific debts each district shall receive individually or shall share
3 between the districts;
4 (d) The division, in bulk or individually, of the originating district's desks,
5 books, computers, projectors, televisions, phones, school buses,
6 automobiles, furniture, equipment, supplies, and other tangible personal
7 property owned by the originating school district; and
8 (e) The continuation, modification, assignment, or termination of
9 nonemployment contracts agreed to by the originating district.
10 (5) The boards of education shall conclude negotiations and enter an agreed division
11 of the originating district's assets and debts by November 1 following the
12 establishing of the new independent district. The agreement may provide a
13 timeline for the general transfer of assets and debts and may also provide for a
14 timeline for the transfer of specific assets. If any matter remains unresolved after
15 the deadline established in this subsection, the matters shall be presented to the
16 commissioner of education or designee for resolution pursuant to subsection (6)
17 of this section. Any proposed agreement to the division of the originating district's
18 assets shall be agreed to by a majority vote of each district's board of education.
19 (6) On issues the boards cannot come to agreement under subsection (4) or (5) of
20 this section, a board may appeal to the commissioner of education or designee to
21 determine an equitable resolution of the disagreement. In any determination, the
22 decision shall prioritize the successful operation of both districts. The matter
23 shall be decided within thirty (30) days of the submission. The commissioner or
24 designee shall notify the districts of the decision. The decisions may be appealed
25 to the Kentucky Board of Education at its next regular meeting.
26 (7) If any disagreement between the boards remains unresolved after the passage of
27 the deadlines in subsections (5) and (6) of this section, the Kentucky Department
Page 9 of 18
XXXX 1/4/2025 11:05 AM Jacketed

1 of Education shall assess a fine to the districts in the amount of the dispute in
2 question with the fine divided proportionally in the same manner as in subsection
3 (3)(e) of this section and shall be placed in the fund to support education
4 excellence in Kentucky.
5 (8) By the second June 30 following the establishment of the new independent
6 district, the transfer of all assets and debts identified in the agreement made
7 under subsection (5) of this section or resolved under subsection (6) of this
8 section shall be determined and completed.
9 (9) The altered originating district shall continue to exercise taxing authority over
10 both the altered originating district and the new independent district and shall
11 collect revenues in the same manner as the originating district. For the tax year
12 in which the deadline to be fully operational established in subsection (4)(h) of
13 Section 4 of this Act occurs, the amounts collected by the altered originating
14 district shall first be divided by two (2). The quotient shall then be distributed
15 proportionally between the two districts in the same manner as in subsection
16 (3)(e) of this section. Upon the close of that tax year, the new independent district
17 shall be responsible for collecting the taxes within the boundaries of the district
18 as otherwise provided by law.

12 (a) The interim board shall develop, adopt, maintain, and comply with the
13 transition plan required under Section 6 of this Act;
14 (b) By January 1 after its establishment, the interim board shall develop an
