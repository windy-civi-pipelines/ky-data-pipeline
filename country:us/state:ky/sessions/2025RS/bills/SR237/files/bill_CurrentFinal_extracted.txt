2 Kentucky Department of Education, in partnership with the Secretary of State and
3 education entities, to develop strategies and a timeline for improving Kentucky students’
4 knowledge and understanding of the constitutional republic of the United States of
5 America and the democratic processes specified in the United States Constitution.
6 WHEREAS, the United States government has designated September 17 as
7 Constitution Day and Citizenship Day to commemorate the signing of the U.S.
8 Constitution in Philadelphia on September 17, 1787; and
9 WHEREAS, the United States Congress has mandated that "each educational
10 institution that receives federal funds for a fiscal year shall hold an educational program
11 on the United States Constitution on September 17 of such year for the students served by
12 the educational institution"; and
13 WHEREAS, many students exit their secondary and postsecondary education
14 without an in-depth understanding of the rights and responsibilities of citizens under the
15 United State Constitution; and
16 WHEREAS, education for citizenship is important to help every student evolve into
17 an active knowledgeable participant in a constitutional republic society; and
18 WHEREAS, the United States of America was founded on the principle of a
19 government by the people, as recognized in our foundational documents of the
20 Declaration of Independence, United States Constitution, and Bill of Rights; and
21 WHEREAS, evidence abounds of steadily increasing disillusionment of the
22 perceived relevant value of constitutional knowledge to guide citizen navigation of
23 societal issues and achieve sustainable problem-solving remedies. Analysis and
24 discernment reveal such positions are expressed by many citizens who demonstrate a
25 conspicuous lack of this constitutional education, and is manifested in the concurrent
26 decline in confidence expressed through the rise in public discourse, general
27 conversation, and behavior that seeks to highlight, reflect, and communicate concerns of

4 Constitution to help those citizens live out the values contained therein, including life and
5 liberty, through individual leadership roles and responsibilities in both the public and
6 private sector; and
7 WHEREAS, access to education and resources on the structure and function of the
8 United States Constitution is indispensable towards empowering each citizen to develop
9 critical thinking skills and to serve the expressed intent of the General Assembly in KRS
10 158.645 to create a system of public schools that, in part, allows and assists students to
11 acquire communication skills necessary to function in a complex and changing
12 civilization and to understand governmental processes and their impact on the
13 community, state, and nation; and
14 WHEREAS, students need to be enabled and encouraged to acquire of core of basic
15 knowledge in social and cultural issues and institutions to empower them to utilize their
16 understanding of a constitutional republic in a functional perspective, thereby equipping
17 each with an actionable awareness of the extents and limitations of an individual's rights
18 and responsibilities within a constitutional republic; and
19 WHEREAS, public schools and postsecondary institutions, as well as their
20 governing boards and appurtenant organizations, are ultimately responsible for providing
21 sound and knowledgeable leadership to ensure Kentucky's students leave the Kentucky
22 education system having been empowered with the essential skills and knowledge to live
23 a life of constitutionally sound and responsible citizenship;
24 NOW, THEREFORE,
