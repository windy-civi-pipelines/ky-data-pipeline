6 imposed by this section. Any agreement shall specify that it is made in the
7 Commonwealth of Kentucky and governed by the laws of the Commonwealth
8 of Kentucky.
9 (4) No investment or disbursement of funds shall be made unless authorized by the
10 board of trustees, except that the board, in order to ensure timely market
11 transactions, shall establish investment guidelines and may permit its staff and

19 Teachers' Retirement System, including fees and commissions paid to an
20 investment manager, private fund, or company issuing securities, who manages

1 AN ACT relating to the fiduciary duties owed to the state-administered retirement
2 systems.
3 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
4 Section 1. KRS 21.450 is amended to read as follows:
5 (1) The benefits provided by KRS 21.350 to 21.510 to be paid shall be funded through
6 contract with a reputable life insurance company authorized to do business in this
7 state, or through investment and reinvestment of funds in securities which, at the
8 time of making the investment, are by law permitted for the investment of funds by
9 fiduciaries in this state, or through a combination of such methods. To the extent
10 that funding is provided through insurance contract, no contributions, payments or
