1 A RESOLUTION honoring and congratulating the Frankfort Elks Lodge #530 upon
2 the occasion of the 125th anniversary of its founding.
3 WHEREAS, founded in New York City on February 16, 1867, the Benevolent and
4 Protective Order of Elks has spread across the country, now with over 750,000 members
5 from almost 2,000 lodges nationwide who espouse the Elks’ cardinal principles of
6 charity, justice, brotherly love, and fidelity; and
7 WHEREAS, on December 21, 1899, the Frankfort Lodge #530 of the Elks was
8 established with 32 charter members, and the original lodge was built on Lewis Street in
9 downtown Frankfort in 1902. After the original lodge was lost in a fire in 1958, the
10 current lodge was erected on the same site; and
11 WHEREAS, the members of the Frankfort Elks have dedicated their time and
12 money to upholding those virtues, investing thousands of hours each year to build
13 stronger communities, assist homeless veterans, and improve the lives of children. To
14 that end, Frankfort Elks have disbursed, over the course of the lodge’s history, more than
15 $6 million in cash, goods, and services to the nation’s veterans, youth, the disadvantaged
16 and handicapped, and patriotic and civic programs; and
17 WHEREAS, the philanthropic efforts of the Frankfort Elks Lodge are not limited to
18 the capital city, as shown by the lodge's role in coordinating the relief efforts of Elks
19 nationwide in response to devastating floods in Eastern Kentucky in 2022; and
20 WHEREAS, the programs of the Frankfort Elks have a special emphasis on
21 children. From giving every 3rd grade student in the lodge area a dictionary, to spreading
22 the Elks’ drug awareness message, to conducting annual Hoop Shoot and Soccer Shoot
23 programs to foster healthy competition, to providing thousands of dollars in scholarship
24 money to college-bound students, the Frankfort Elks have made supporting and fostering
25 the next generation of leaders their organization’s calling card; and
26 WHEREAS, this dedication to children is perhaps best exemplified through the
27 Frankfort Lodge's support of the Kentucky Elks major project, providing funding for two

1 summer camps that serve medically fragile children, allowing these innocent ones, who
2 have had to grow up too quickly, the opportunity to be children again, if only for too brief
3 a time; and
4 WHEREAS, embedded in the fabric of America, the Elks are steadfast in their
5 commitment to honoring and serving our nation’s military members and veterans. The
6 Frankfort Elks fulfill this promise daily in visiting and providing social events and
7 friendship to veterans in Veterans Affairs medical facilities, hospitals, and nursing homes
8 and donating much needed supplies and equipment to these facilities to ensure the
9 veterans receive the care they deserve, as well as helping to rehome veterans into the
10 community; and
11 WHEREAS, it is indeed fitting and proper that an organization of such high
12 purpose and good deeds, honestly and selflessly performed, receive public recognition
13 and commendation;
14 NOW, THEREFORE,
15 Be it resolved by the Senate of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of
16 Kentucky:
17 Section 1. The members of the Senate join Senator Gex Williams in

21 in its future endeavors.
22 Section 2. The Clerk of the Senate shall transmit a copy of this Resolution to
