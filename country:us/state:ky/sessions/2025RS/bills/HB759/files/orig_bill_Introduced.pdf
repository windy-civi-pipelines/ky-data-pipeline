2 section for the preceding year, and the timing and manner of disposal of the
3 petition by each court. For each approved petition granting an abortion filed
4 under subsection (3) of this section, the specific court finding in subsection
5 (4) of this section shall be included in the report.
6 (9) (a) The requirements of subsections (2), (3), and (4) of this section shall not apply
7 when, in the best medical judgment of the physician based on the facts of the
8 case before him or her, a medical emergency exists that so complicates the
9 pregnancy as to require an immediate abortion.
10 (b) If a medical emergency exists, the physician shall make reasonable attempts,
11 whenever possible, and without endangering the minor, to contact the parent
12 or legal guardian of the minor, and may proceed, but must document reasons
13 for the medical necessity in the minor's medical records.
14 (c) The physician shall inform the parent or legal guardian, in person or by
15 telephone, within twenty-four (24) hours of the abortion, including details of
16 the medical emergency that necessitated the abortion without the parent's or
17 legal guardian's consent. The physician shall also provide this information in
18 writing to the parent or legal guardian at his or her last known address by
19 first-class mail or by certified mail, return receipt requested, with delivery
20 restricted to the parent or legal guardian.
21 (10) A report indicating the basis for any medical judgment that warrants failure to
22 obtain consent pursuant to this section shall be filed with the Cabinet for Health and
23 Family Services on a form supplied by the cabinet. This report shall be confidential.
24 (11) Failure to obtain consent pursuant to the requirements of this section is prima facie
25 evidence of failure to obtain informed consent and of interference with family
26 relations in appropriate civil actions. The law of this state shall not be construed to
27 preclude the award of exemplary damages in any appropriate civil action relevant to
