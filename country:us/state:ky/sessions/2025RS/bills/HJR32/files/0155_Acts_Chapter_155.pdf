WHEREAS, 2024 Ky. Acts ch. 175, Part I, A., 27., (5) requires that certain criteria be used by the School

NOW, THEREFORE,
Be it resolved by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
ïƒ¢Section 1. (1) The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky hereby approves and
authorizes the Office of State Budget Director to release awards from the School Facility Assistance Fund in
accordance with 2024 Ky. Acts ch. 175, Part I, A., 27., (5) in the specified amounts to the following local school
districts for fiscal year 2025-2026:
(a) $3,837,000 to Adair County Schools;
(b) $2,679,000 to Augusta Independent;
(c) $21,563,000 to Bardstown Independent;
(d) $53,000 to Beechwood Independent;
(e) $7,917,000 to Fleming County Schools;
(f) $7,463,000 to Garrard County Schools;
(g) $25,348,000 to Harrison County Schools;
(h) $39,099,000 to Johnson County Schools;
(i) $9,870,000 to Marion County Schools;
(j) $2,959,000 to Powell County Schools;
(k) $5,851,000 to Somerset Independent;
(l) $24,000 to Walton Verona Independent; and
(m) $3,724,000 to Williamstown Independent.
(2) Award amounts are 50 percent of the difference between the costs to construct, repair, or renovate
facilities and the amount of available local resources for school facility projects certified in the audit conducted
pursuant to 2024 Ky. Acts ch. 175, Part I, A., 22., (11). These facilities are A1 or A2 schools, are ranked as a Priority
1 or 2 on the local school district's facility plan, are not athletic facilities, have been assigned a BG number by the
Kentucky Department of Education with a prefix value between 19 and 23, have begun or are ready to start
construction, and are in school districts that have levied a ten-cent equivalent tax dedicated to capital improvements
but remain unable to cash fund or to sufficiently support the required annual debt service for replacement or
renovation of the facilities as of January 1, 2024. Six of the 19 districts evaluated either failed to meet the criteria or
had sufficient local resources to cover construction, repair, or renovation costs.
