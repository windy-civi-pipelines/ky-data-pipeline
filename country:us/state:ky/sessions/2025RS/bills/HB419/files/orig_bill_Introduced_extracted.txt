26 services shall be limited to the actual cost of the goods or services to the

Page 32 of 103
XXXX 1/8/2025 11:20 AM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1018
1 between the facility and the supplier exists. A relationship shall be considered
2 to exist when an individual, including brothers, sisters, father, mother, aunts,
3 uncles, and in-laws, possesses a total of five percent (5%) or more of
4 ownership equity in the facility and the supplying business. An exception to
5 the relationship shall exist if fifty-one percent (51%) or more of the supplier's
6 business activity of the type carried on with the facility is transacted with
7 persons and organizations other than the facility and its related organizations.
8 (3) No vendor payment shall be made unless the class and type of medical care
9 rendered and the cost basis for the medical care[therefor] has first been designated
10 by regulation.

16 standards and the methods for determining cost formulae for vendor payments
17 within each category of public assistance and other recipients shall be uniform for
18 the entire state, and shall be designated by regulation promulgated within the
19 limitations established by the Social Security Act and federal regulations. It shall
20 not be necessary that the amount of payments for units of services be uniform for
21 the entire state but amounts may vary from county to county and from city to city,
22 as well as among hospitals, based on the prevailing cost of medical care in each
23 locale and other local economic and geographic conditions, except that insofar as
24 allowed by applicable federal law and regulation, the maximum amounts
25 reimbursable for similar services rendered by physicians within the same specialty
26 of medical practice shall not vary according to the physician's place of residence or
27 place of practice, as long as the place of practice is within the boundaries of the

10 (6)[(8)] (a) If payments made to community mental health centers, established

13 payments shall be used solely for the provision of other services to the
14 intellectually disabled through community mental health centers.
15 (b) Except as provided in KRS 210.370(4) and (5)(c), if a community mental
16 health center, established pursuant to KRS Chapter 210, provides services to a
17 recipient of Medical Assistance Program benefits outside of the community
18 mental health center's regional service area, as established in KRS 210.370,
19 the community mental health center shall not be reimbursed for those[such]
20 services in accordance with the department's fee schedule for community
21 mental health centers but shall instead be reimbursed in accordance with the
22 department's fee schedule for behavioral health service organizations.

1 reimbursement under the provisions of the Medical Assistance Program solely on
2 the basis of the person's paying status as a Medicaid recipient. No person shall be
3 removed or discharged from any facility solely because they became eligible for
4 participation in the Medical Assistance Program, unless the facility can demonstrate
5 the resident or the resident's responsible party was fully notified in writing that the
6 resident was being admitted to a bed not certified for Medicaid reimbursement. No
7 facility may decertify a bed occupied by a Medicaid recipient or may decertify a

19 take any longer than ninety (90) days from receipt of the credentialing
20 application to deny or approve and contract with the provider.
21 (d) A Medicaid managed care organization shall adjudicate any clean claims
22 submitted for a substance use disorder service from an enrolled and
23 credentialed behavioral health provider who provides substance use disorder
24 services in accordance with KRS 304.17A-700 to 304.17A-730.

19 chapter which warrant the issuance of a complaint; in these instances, the

4 or the hearing officer on behalf of the panel shall preside over all proceedings
5 pursuant to the issuance of a complaint.

7 disposition of any complaint, and an informal disposition may be made at any stage

9 (7) Upon completion of an administrative hearing, the hearing panel shall issue a final
10 order that:
11 (a) Dismisses the complaint upon a conclusion that[ the provisions of] this
12 chapter has[have] not been violated;
13 (b) Finds a violation[ of the provisions] of this chapter, but does not impose
14 discipline because the panel does not believe discipline to be necessary under
15 the circumstances; or

17 revoke, suspend, restrict, deny, or limit a license, or may reprimand a licensee
18 or place a licensee on probation under terms the panel may establish to protect

2 (8) Regardless of the restrictions on public disclosure of information established in
3 subsection (9) of this section, the board may order information derived from any
4 investigation or inquiry be released to the physician licensure authority of another
5 state or to any health care or mental health care facility licensed and regulated by
6 the Commonwealth of Kentucky upon a showing that the information is necessary
7 to determine the propriety of a physician practicing in a particular state or facility.
8 (9) The presiding officer at any proceeding held pursuant to a complaint or show cause
9 order shall take whatever measures are necessary to protect the privacy interests of
10 individuals other than the charged physician upon a showing that evidence is to be
11 introduced, the public disclosure of which would constitute a clear invasion of
12 personal privacy. It is the general policy of the Commonwealth that administrative
13 proceedings should be open to the public. Therefore, in applying this subsection,
14 the presiding officer shall balance the competing interests and employ the least
15 restrictive measures available to protect the privacy interests involved.

8 obtain an abortion prior to the viability of the fetus, or to protect the life or health
9 of the pregnant person.
10 (3) The state shall not, in the regulation or provision of benefits, facilities, services,
11 or information, deny or interfere with an individual's fundamental rights,
12 including individuals under state supervision, custody, or control to:
13 (a) Choose or refuse contraception or sterilization; or
14 (b) Choose or refuse to bear a child or obtain an abortion.
15 (4) The state shall not discriminate in the protection or enforcement of these
16 fundamental rights on the basis of sex, disability, race, ethnicity, gender identity,
17 age, marital status, national origin, immigration status, religion, or sexual
18 orientation.
19 (5) Any state or local official who is charged with violating this section shall be
20 subject to an action in federal or state court for injunctive relief and damages,

1 Commonwealth of Kentucky;
2 (3) "Medical emergency" means any condition that in the physician's reasonable
3 medical judgment, based upon facts known to the physician at the time, so
4 complicates the person's pregnancy as to necessitate the immediate performance
5 or inducement of an abortion to prevent the death of the pregnant person or to
6 avoid a serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily
7 function of the pregnant person that delay in the performance or inducement of
8 the abortion would create;
9 (4) "Physician" means any person licensed to practice medicine or osteopathy in the
10 Commonwealth pursuant to this chapter;
11 (5) "Probable gestational age of the embryo or fetus" means the gestational age that,
12 in the judgment of a physician, is, within reasonable probability, the gestational

16 by a reasonably prudent physician, knowledgeable about the case and the
17 treatment possibilities with respect to the medical conditions involved;
18 (7) "Unborn child" means a member of the species homo sapiens in utero; and
19 (8) "Viability" means that state of human development when the life of the unborn
20 child may be continued by natural or life-supportive systems outside the womb of

22 Section 3. KRS 311.780 is repealed, reenacted as a new section of KRS Chapter
23 311, and amended to read as follows:
24 No abortion shall be performed or prescribed knowingly after the unborn child may

1 between the facility and the supplier exists. A relationship shall be considered
2 to exist when an individual, including brothers, sisters, father, mother, aunts,
3 uncles, and in-laws, possesses a total of five percent (5%) or more of
4 ownership equity in the facility and the supplying business. An exception to
5 the relationship shall exist if fifty-one percent (51%) or more of the supplier's

17 recipient of Medical Assistance Program benefits outside of the community
18 mental health center's regional service area, as established in KRS 210.370,
19 the community mental health center shall not be reimbursed for those[such]

4 participation in the Medical Assistance Program, unless the facility can demonstrate
5 the resident or the resident's responsible party was fully notified in writing that the
6 resident was being admitted to a bed not certified for Medicaid reimbursement. No

19 chapter which warrant the issuance of a complaint; in these instances, the

10 order that:
11 (a) Dismisses the complaint upon a conclusion that[ the provisions of] this
12 chapter has[have] not been violated;
13 (b) Finds a violation[ of the provisions] of this chapter, but does not impose
14 discipline because the panel does not believe discipline to be necessary under

3 subsection (9) of this section, the board may order information derived from any
4 investigation or inquiry be released to the physician licensure authority of another
5 state or to any health care or mental health care facility licensed and regulated by
6 the Commonwealth of Kentucky upon a showing that the information is necessary
7 to determine the propriety of a physician practicing in a particular state or facility.
8 (9) The presiding officer at any proceeding held pursuant to a complaint or show cause
9 order shall take whatever measures are necessary to protect the privacy interests of
10 individuals other than the charged physician upon a showing that evidence is to be
11 introduced, the public disclosure of which would constitute a clear invasion of
12 personal privacy. It is the general policy of the Commonwealth that administrative
13 proceedings should be open to the public. Therefore, in applying this subsection,
14 the presiding officer shall balance the competing interests and employ the least
15 restrictive measures available to protect the privacy interests involved.
