11 shall be implemented within fourteen (14) days of the issuance of the

20 (5) The Attorney General shall have standing to enforce the provisions of this statute
21 in the event of any violation and shall have standing to intervene in any action
22 seeking enforcement. In addition to declaratory and injunctive relief, the

24 amount not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) per day for each day of the
