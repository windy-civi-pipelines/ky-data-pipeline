5 (5) No payment of premium by any department, board, agency, public postsecondary

12 does provide those services, and the state contribution for the plan shall be the
13 amount available in the county where the plan selected is located.

15 in the best interests of the state group to allow any carrier bidding to offer health
16 care coverage under this section to submit bids that may vary county by county or
17 by larger geographic areas.
18 (20) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the bid for proposals for health
19 insurance coverage for calendar year 2004 shall include a bid scenario that reflects
20 the statewide rating structure provided in calendar year 2003 and a bid scenario that
