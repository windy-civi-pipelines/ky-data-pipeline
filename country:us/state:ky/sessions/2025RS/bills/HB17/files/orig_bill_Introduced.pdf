1 regulation and provided by a licensed physician, physician assistant, or advanced
2 practice registered nurse to determine if he or she can perform peace officer duties
3 as determined by a validated job task analysis. However, if the employing agency
4 has its own validated job task analysis, the person shall pass the medical
5 examination, appropriate to the agency's job task analysis, of the employing agency.
6 All agencies shall certify passing medical examination results to the council, which
7 shall accept them as complying with KRS 15.310 to 15.510;
8 (11) Have passed a drug screening test administered or approved by the council by

18 regulation, the agency shall conduct the background investigation and shall certify
19 background investigation results to the council, which shall accept them as
20 complying with KRS 15.310 to 15.510;
21 (13) Have been interviewed by the employing agency;
22 (14) Not have had certification as a peace officer permanently revoked in another state;
23 (15) Have taken a psychological suitability screening administered or approved by the

25 peace officer duties as determined by a council validated job task analysis.
26 However, if the employing agency has its own validated job task analysis, the
27 person shall take that agency's psychological suitability screening[examination],

1 appropriate to the agency's job task analysis. All agencies shall certify
2 psychological suitability screening[examination] results to the council, which shall
3 accept them as complying with KRS 15.310 to 15.510;
4 (16) (a) Have passed a physical agility test administered or approved by the council by
5 administrative regulation to determine his or her suitability to perform peace
6 officer duties as determined by a council validated job task analysis.
7 However, if the employing agency has its own validated job task analysis, the
8 person shall take the physical agility test[examination] of the employing
9 agency. All agencies shall certify physical agility test[examination] results to
10 the council, which shall accept them as demonstrating compliance with KRS
11 15.310 to 15.510;[ and]
12 (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, a person who has
13 previously been employed as a peace officer in the Commonwealth before
14 December 1, 1998, shall not be required to pass a physical agility test
15 administered or approved by the council by administrative regulation unless
16 the employing agency requires it as a condition of employment; and
17 (17) Have taken a polygraph examination administered or approved by the council by
18 administrative regulation to determine his or her suitability to perform peace officer
19 duties. Any agency that administers its own polygraph examination as approved by
20 the council shall certify the results that indicate whether a person is suitable for
21 employment as a peace officer to the council, which shall accept them as complying
22 with KRS 15.310 to 15.510.
23 Section 2. Whereas it is critical to ensure that police departments are able to
24 attract and hire highly qualified peace officers, an emergency is declared to exist, and this
25 Act takes effect upon its passage and approval by the Governor or upon its otherwise
26 becoming a law.
