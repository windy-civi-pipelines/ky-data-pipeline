UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 2051
1 A RESOLUTION urging the Energy and Environment Cabinet to explore and
2 implement strategies to remove waste tires from Kentucky’s streams and waterways.
3 WHEREAS, waste tires present a significant and enduring threat to the health and
4 quality of Kentucky's 90,000 miles of waterways as well as the individuals and
5 communities that rely on and enjoy them; and
6 WHEREAS, annually, approximately four million waste tires are generated in
7 Kentucky, equating to roughly one tire per resident. These tires are often illegally
8 dumped into rivers, streams, and creeks or washed into waterways during floods; and
9 WHEREAS, the presence of tires in Kentucky's waterways leads to water pollution
10 and human health risks. Tires do not naturally decompose, but as they degrade, they can
11 release toxins, including microplastics and chemicals, that contaminate water sources and
12 pose health risks to humans; and
13 WHEREAS, the presence of tires in Kentucky's waterways also leads to community
14 degradation and economic loss. Tire pollution diminishes the quality of life in
15 communities near affected waterways and hampers safe access to fishing and recreational
16 activities; and
17 WHEREAS, the threat posed by waste tires to Kentucky's waterways is both real
18 and pressing. With limited funding for the removal and repurposing of waste tires we call
19 for the allocation of resources and the creation of opportunities for the effective removal,
20 recycling, and repurposing of these tires. Addressing this issue is crucial for the health
21 and well-being of the numerous communities that rely on our vital water resources;
22 NOW, THEREFORE,
23 Be it resolved by the Senate of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of
24 Kentucky:
25 Section 1. The Senate urges the Energy and Environment Cabinet to explore
26 and implement strategies to remove waste tires from Kentucky’s waterways.
