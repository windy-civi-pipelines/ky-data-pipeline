1 (a) Employ class action procedures; or
2 (b) Conduct test representative cases.
3 (18) Board members shall abstain from public comment about a pending or impending

2 (21) If a final order of the board is appealed, a court may award reasonable attorney fees
3 to an employee who prevails by a final adjudication on the merits as provided by
4 KRS 453.260. This award shall not include attorney fees attributable to the hearing
5 before the board.
6 (22) When any employee is dismissed and not ordered reinstated after the appeal, the

10 (23) After a final decision has been rendered by the board or court, an employee who
11 prevails in an[his or her] appeal may be credited with the amount of leave time
12 used for time spent at the[his or her] hearing before the board or court. Employees
13 who had an insufficient amount of leave time shall be credited with leave time
14 equal to the amount of time spent at their hearings before the board or court.

16 rules otherwise, the reinstated employee shall remain in the employee's[his or her]
17 former position, or a position of like status or pay, until the conclusion of the
18 appeals process, at which time the appointing authority shall take action in
19 accordance with the court order.

3 Board. The appeal shall be filed in writing with the executive director of the board
4 not later than thirty (30) days after the notification of the action in question has

1 (a) Employ class action procedures; or
2 (b) Conduct test representative cases.
3 (18) Board members shall abstain from public comment about a pending or impending

5 public statements in the course of their official duties or from explaining for public
6 information the procedures of the board.
7 (19) An appeal to the board may be heard by the full board or one (1) or more of the

5 before the board.
6 (22) When any employee is dismissed and not ordered reinstated after the appeal, the

13 who had an insufficient amount of leave time shall be credited with leave time

2 without cause within one (1) year after reinstatement, may appeal to the Personnel
3 Board. The appeal shall be filed in writing with the executive director of the board
4 not later than thirty (30) days after the notification of the action in question has
