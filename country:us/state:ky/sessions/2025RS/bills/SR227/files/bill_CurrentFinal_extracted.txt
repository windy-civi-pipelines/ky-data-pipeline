2 United States Army.
3 WHEREAS, in 1775, in the early months of the American Revolution, General
4 George Washington made fervent appeals for a regular fighting force; and
5 WHEREAS, hearing General Washington's concerns, the Second Continental
6 Congress, on June 14, 1775, organized the first iteration of the United States Army by
7 combining 22,000 militia troops around Boston at that time with an additional 5,000
8 militiamen in New York; and
9 WHEREAS, this new force, still composed of militia, was placed under the
10 command of General Washington on July 3, 1775; and
11 WHEREAS, as General Washington recognized that the various components under
12 his command still functioned in effect as militias, he urged the Continental Congress for a
13 force that was not comprised of militia members, but was a distinct force with members
14 from all the colonies that could be better trained and prepared for engagements where
15 needed, which the Continental Congress provided; and
16 WHEREAS, the United States Army as it stands today is a force of more than
17 700,000 soldiers extensively and professionally trained to defend American interests in
18 any terrain at any time; and
19 WHEREAS, the soul of the United States Army is its soldiers who offer their very
20 lives in sacrifice for American ideals, family, and, particularly in times of combat, their
21 fellow soldiers; and
22 WHEREAS, the United States Army has answered the call of American interests
23 over the course of three centuries, but in the 20th Century and the 21st Century, the
24 United States Army has been deployed notably in World War I, World War II, the
25 Korean War, the Vietnam War, Desert Shield and Desert Storm, and the Global War on
26 Terror; and
27 WHEREAS, without this stalwart fighting force, the citizens of the United States
