1 A RESOLUTION commemorating the 250th anniversary of the founding of the
2 United States Navy.
3 WHEREAS, in August of 1775, delegates from Rhode Island entreated the
4 Continental Congress to request a fleet of ships be established to protect the colonies; and
5 WHEREAS, on October 13, 1775, the recognized date of the founding of the
6 United States Navy, the Continental Congress agreed with the request and formed an
7 advisory committee that went on to supply George Washington with an armed schooner
8 and a sloop. Connecticut and Rhode Island similarly armed merchant vessels to monitor
9 the Atlantic waters near their states; and
10 WHEREAS, the colonies began to build up the burgeoning navy which would
11 become instrumental when England declared the colonies to be in rebellion in November
12 of 1775; and
13 WHEREAS, from these humble origins of making due, the United States Navy has
14 emerged as the most formidable naval force in the world; and
15 WHEREAS, the United States Navy has been employed with success in the
16 American Revolution, World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War,
17 Desert Shield and Desert Storm, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation Iraqi
18 Freedom; and
19 WHEREAS, the men and women of the United States Navy are consummate
20 professionals, and those in vessels serve in particularly harsh environments, for if the
21 vessel is lost, their lives are in grave jeopardy of being forfeit, yet all serve and offer their
22 lives in service; and
23 WHEREAS, the presence of United States Navy vessels constitutes a projection of
24 American might that has preserved this American way of life for the citizens of the
25 United States of America and its allies;
26 NOW, THEREFORE,
27 Be it resolved by the Senate of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of
