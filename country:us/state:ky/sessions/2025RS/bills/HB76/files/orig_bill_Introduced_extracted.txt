7 5. Very heavy work shall be work that involves lifting objects weighing
8 more than one hundred (100) pounds at a time with frequent lifting or
9 carrying of objects weighing fifty (50) or more pounds. If the person is

14 2. "Hazardous disability" means a disability which results in an employee's
15 total incapacity to continue as an employee in a hazardous position, but
16 the employee is not necessarily deemed to be totally and permanently
17 disabled to engage in other occupations for remuneration or profit.
18 (b) In determining whether the disability meets the requirement of this section,
19 any reasonable accommodation provided by the employer as provided in 42
20 U.S.C. sec. 12111(9) and 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630 shall be considered.
21 (c) If the board determines that the total and permanent disability of a member
22 receiving a retirement allowance under this section has ceased, then the board
23 shall determine if the member has a hazardous disability as defined by KRS
24 78.510.
25 (2) Any person may qualify to retire on disability, subject to the following:
26 (a) The person shall have sixty (60) months of service, twelve (12) of which shall
27 be current service credited under KRS 16.543(1), 61.543(1), or 78.615(1). The

1 service requirement shall be waived if the disability is a total and permanent
2 disability or a hazardous disability and is a direct result of an act in line of
3 duty;
4 (b) For a person whose membership date is prior to August 1, 2004, the person
5 shall not be eligible for an unreduced retirement allowance;
6 (c) The person's application shall be on file in the retirement office no later than
7 twenty-four (24) months after the person's last day of paid employment, as
8 defined in KRS 78.510, in a regular full-time position that has been approved
9 as a hazardous position in accordance with KRS 78.5520;
10 (d) The person shall receive a satisfactory determination pursuant to KRS 61.665;
11 and
12 (e) A person's disability application based on the same claim of incapacity shall
13 be accepted and reconsidered for disability if accompanied by new objective
14 medical evidence. The application shall be on file in the retirement office no
15 later than twenty-four (24) months after the person's last day of paid
16 employment in a regular full-time hazardous position.
17 (3) Upon the examination of the objective medical evidence by licensed physicians
18 pursuant to KRS 61.665, it shall be determined that:
19 (a) The incapacity results from bodily injury, mental illness, or disease. For
20 purposes of this section, "injury" means any physical harm or damage to the
21 human organism other than disease or mental illness;
22 (b) The incapacity is deemed to be permanent; and
23 (c) The incapacity does not result directly or indirectly from:
24 1. Injury intentionally self-inflicted while sane or insane; or
25 2. Bodily injury, mental illness, disease, or condition which pre-existed
26 membership in the system or reemployment, whichever is most recent,
27 unless:
Page 126 of 137
XXXX 1/3/2025 4:09 PM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1007
1 a. The disability results from bodily injury, mental illness, disease, or
2 a condition which has been substantially aggravated by an injury
3 or accident arising out of or in the course of employment; or
4 b. The person has at least sixteen (16) years' current or prior service
5 for employment with employers participating in the County
6 Employees Retirement System or the Kentucky Retirement
7 Systems.
8 For purposes of this subparagraph, "reemployment" shall not mean a
9 change of employment between employers participating in the County
10 Employees Retirement System or the Kentucky Retirement Systems
11 with no loss of service credit.
12 (4) (a) 1. An incapacity shall be deemed to be permanent for the purpose of
13 hazardous disability if it is expected to result in death or can be expected
14 to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve (12) months from
15 the person's last day of paid employment in a hazardous position.
16 2. The determination of a permanent incapacity for the purpose of
17 hazardous disability shall be based on the medical evidence contained in
18 the member's file and the member's residual functional capacity and
19 physical exertion requirements.
20 3. The determination of a total and permanent incapacity shall be based on
21 the medical evidence contained in the member's file and the member's
22 residual functional capacity.
23 (b) The person's residual functional capacity shall be the person's capacity for
24 work activity on a regular and continuing basis. The person's physical ability
25 shall be assessed in light of the severity of the person's physical, mental, and
26 other impairments. The person's ability to walk, stand, carry, push, pull, reach,
27 handle, and other physical functions shall be considered with regard to
Page 127 of 137
XXXX 1/3/2025 4:09 PM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1007
1 physical impairments. The person's ability to understand, remember, and carry
2 out instructions and respond appropriately to supervision, coworkers, and
3 work pressures in a work setting shall be considered with regard to mental
4 impairments. Other impairments, including skin impairments, epilepsy, visual
5 sensory impairments, postural and manipulative limitations, and
6 environmental restrictions, shall be considered in conjunction with the
7 person's physical and mental impairments to determine residual functional
8 capacity.
9 (c) The person's physical exertion requirements shall be determined based on the
10 following standards:
11 1. Sedentary work shall be work that involves lifting no more than ten (10)
12 pounds at a time and occasionally lifting or carrying articles such as
13 large files, ledgers, and small tools. Although a sedentary job primarily
14 involves sitting, occasional walking and standing may also be required
15 in the performance of duties.
16 2. Light work shall be work that involves lifting no more than twenty (20)
17 pounds at a time with frequent lifting or carrying of objects weighing up
18 to ten (10) pounds. A job shall be in this category if lifting is
19 infrequently required but walking and standing are frequently required,
20 or if the job primarily requires sitting with pushing and pulling of arm or
21 leg controls. If the person has the ability to perform substantially all of
22 these activities, the person shall be deemed capable of light work. A
23 person deemed capable of light work shall be deemed capable of
24 sedentary work unless the person has additional limitations such as the
25 loss of fine dexterity or inability to sit for long periods.
26 3. Medium work shall be work that involves lifting no more than fifty (50)
27 pounds at a time with frequent lifting or carrying of objects weighing up
Page 128 of 137
XXXX 1/3/2025 4:09 PM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1007
1 to twenty-five (25) pounds. If the person is deemed capable of medium
2 work, the person shall be deemed capable of light and sedentary work.
3 4. Heavy work shall be work that involves lifting no more than one
4 hundred (100) pounds at a time with frequent lifting or carrying of
5 objects weighing up to fifty (50) pounds. If the person is deemed
6 capable of heavy work, the person shall also be deemed capable of
7 medium, light, and sedentary work.
8 5. Very heavy work shall be work that involves lifting objects weighing
9 more than one hundred (100) pounds at a time with frequent lifting or
10 carrying of objects weighing fifty (50) or more pounds. If the person is
11 deemed capable of very heavy work, the person shall be deemed capable
12 of heavy, medium, light, and sedentary work.
13 (5) Upon disability retirement, an employee may receive a disability retirement
14 allowance payable during his or her lifetime which shall be:
15 (a) For a member who began participating in the system prior to August 1, 2004,
16 an annual retirement allowance payable monthly and determined in the same
17 manner as for retirement at his or her normal retirement date with years of
18 service and final compensation being determined as of the date of his or her
19 disability, except that service shall be added beginning with his or her last
20 date of paid employment and continuing to his or her fifty-fifth birthday. The
21 maximum service credit added shall not exceed the total service the member
22 had on his or her last day of paid employment, and the maximum service
23 credit for calculating his or her retirement allowance, including his or her total
24 service and service added under this section, shall not exceed twenty (20)
25 years;
26 (b) For a member who begins participating on or after August 1, 2004, but prior
27 to January 1, 2014, or who begins participating in a hazardous position on
Page 129 of 137
XXXX 1/3/2025 4:09 PM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1007
1 or after January 1, 2026, or who is presumed under Section 1 of this Act to
2 begin participating in a hazardous position immediately prior to January 1,
3 2014, the higher of twenty-five percent (25%) of the member's monthly final
4 rate of pay or the retirement allowance determined in the same manner as for
5 retirement at his or her normal retirement date with years of service and final
6 compensation being determined as of the date of his or her disability; or
7 (c) For a member who begins participating on or after January 1, 2014, but prior
8 to January 1, 2026, in the hybrid cash balance plan as provided by KRS
9 78.5516, who makes an election under subsection (3) of Section 1 of this
10 Act, or who, prior to the effective date of this Act, made an election under
11 Section 7 of this Act, the disability retirement allowance shall be the higher of
12 twenty-five percent (25%) of the member's monthly final rate of pay or the
13 retirement allowance determined in the same manner as for retirement at his
14 or her normal retirement date under KRS 78.5516.
15 (6) If the member receives a satisfactory determination of hazardous disability pursuant
16 to KRS 61.665 and the disability is the direct result of an act in line of duty as
17 defined in KRS 78.510, the member's retirement allowance shall be calculated as
18 follows:
19 (a) For the disabled member, benefits as provided in subsection (5) of this section
20 except that the monthly retirement allowance payable shall not be less than
21 twenty-five percent (25%) of the member's monthly final rate of pay; and
22 (b) For each dependent child of the member on his or her disability retirement
23 date, who is alive at the time any particular payment is due, a monthly
24 payment equal to ten percent (10%) of the disabled member's monthly final
25 rate of pay; however, total maximum dependent children's benefit shall not
26 exceed forty percent (40%) of the member's monthly final rate of pay. The
27 payments shall be payable to each dependent child, or to a legally appointed
Page 130 of 137
XXXX 1/3/2025 4:09 PM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1007
1 guardian or as directed by the system.
2 (7) If the member receives a satisfactory determination of total and permanent
3 disability pursuant to KRS 61.665 and the disability is the direct result of an act in
4 line of duty as defined in KRS 78.510, the member's retirement allowance shall be
5 calculated as follows:
6 (a) For the disabled member, the benefits as provided in subsection (5) of this
7 section, except that the monthly retirement allowance payable shall not be less
8 than seventy-five percent (75%) of the member's monthly average pay; and
9 (b) For each dependent child of the member on his or her disability retirement
10 date, who is alive at the time any particular payment is due, a monthly
11 payment equal to ten percent (10%) of the disabled member's monthly
12 average pay, except that:
13 1. Member and dependent children payments under this subsection shall
14 not exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the member's monthly
15 average pay; and
16 2. Total maximum dependent children's benefits shall not exceed twenty-
17 five percent (25%) of the member's monthly average pay while the
18 member is living and forty percent (40%) of the member's monthly
19 average pay after the member's death. The payments shall be payable to
20 each dependent child, or to a legally appointed guardian or as directed
21 by the system, and shall be divided equally among all dependent
22 children.
23 (8) No benefit provided in this section shall be reduced as a result of any change in the
24 extent of disability of any retired member who is normal retirement age or older.
25 (9) If a regular full-time member in a hazardous position has been approved for
26 benefits under a hazardous disability, the board shall, upon request of the member,
27 permit the member to receive the hazardous disability allowance while accruing
Page 131 of 137

1 benefits in a nonhazardous position, subject to proper medical review of the
2 nonhazardous position's job description by the Authority's medical examiner.
3 Section 26. KRS 78.616 is amended to read as follows:
4 (1) Any employer participating in the County Employees Retirement System which has
5 formally adopted a sick-leave program that is universally administered to its
6 employees may purchase service credit with the retirement system for up to six (6)
7 months of unused sick leave for each retiring employee.
8 (2) Participation under this section shall be at the option of each participating
9 employer. The election to participate shall be made by the governing authority of
10 the participating employer and shall be certified in writing to the system on forms
11 prescribed by the board. The certification shall provide for equal treatment of all
12 employees participating under this section.
13 (3) (a) Upon the member's notification of retirement as prescribed in KRS 61.590,
14 the employer shall certify the retiring employee's unused, accumulated sick-
15 leave balance to the system. The member's sick-leave balance, expressed in
16 days, shall be divided by the average number of working days per month in
17 county service and rounded to the nearest number of whole months. A
18 maximum of six (6) months of the member's sick-leave balance, expressed in
19 months, shall be added to his or her service credit for the purpose of
20 determining his or her annual retirement allowance under KRS 78.510 to
21 78.852 and for the purpose of determining whether the member is eligible to
22 receive a retirement allowance under KRS 78.510 to 78.852, except as
23 provided by paragraph (d) of this subsection. Accumulated sick-leave in
24 excess of six (6) months shall be added to the member's service credit if the
25 member or employer pays to the retirement system the value of the additional
26 service credit based on the formula adopted by the board, subject to the
27 restrictions provided by paragraph (d) of this subsection.
Page 132 of 137

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1007
1 (b) The employer may elect to pay fifty percent (50%) of the cost of the sick
2 leave in excess of six (6) months on behalf of its employees. The employee
3 shall pay the remaining fifty percent (50%). The payment by the employer
4 shall not be deposited to the member's account. Service credit shall not be
5 credited to the member's account until both the employer's and employee's
6 payments are received by the retirement system.
7 (c) Once the employer elects to pay all or fifty percent (50%) of the cost on
8 behalf of its employees, it shall continue to pay the same portion of the cost.
9 (d) For a member who begins participating in the retirement system on or after
10 September 1, 2008, but prior to January 1, 2014, or who begins participating
11 in a hazardous position on or after January 1, 2026, or who is presumed
12 under Section 1 of this Act to begin participating in a hazardous position
13 immediately prior to January 1, 2014, whose employer has established a
14 sick-leave program under subsections (1) to (4) and (6) of this section:
15 1. The member shall receive no more than twelve (12) months of service
16 credit upon retirement for accumulated unused sick leave accrued while
17 contributing to the retirement system from which the retirement benefit

20 purposes of determining the member's annual retirement allowance
21 under KRS 78.510 to 78.852;
22 3. The service added to the member's service credit shall not be used to
23 determine whether a member is eligible to receive a retirement
24 allowance under KRS 78.510 to 78.852; and
25 4. The cost of the service provided by this paragraph shall be paid by the
26 employer.
27 (4) The system shall compute the cost of the sick-leave credit of each retiring employee
Page 133 of 137
XXXX 1/3/2025 4:09 PM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1007
1 and bill each employer with whom the employee accrued sick leave accordingly.
2 The employer shall remit payment within thirty (30) days from receipt of the bill.
3 (5) (a) As an alternative to subsections (1), (3), (4), and (6) of this section, any
4 agency participating in the County Employees Retirement System which has
5 formally adopted a sick-leave program that is universally administered to its
6 employees, or administered to a majority of eligible employees in accordance
7 with subsection (6) of this section, shall, at the time of termination, or as
8 provided in KRS 161.155 in the case of school boards, compensate the
9 employee for unused sick-leave days the employee has accumulated which it
10 is the uniform policy of the agency to allow.
11 (b) The rate of compensation for each unused sick-leave day shall be based on the
12 daily salary rate calculated from the employee's current rate of pay. Payment
13 for unused sick-leave days shall be incorporated into the employee's final
14 compensation if the employee and employer make the regular employee and
15 employer contributions, respectively, on the sick-leave payment.
16 (c) The number of sick-leave days for which the employee is compensated shall
17 be divided by the average number of working days per month in county
18 service and rounded to the nearest number of whole months. This number of
19 months shall be added to the employee's total service credit and to the number
20 of months used to determine creditable compensation, pursuant to KRS
21 78.510, but no more than sixty (60) months shall be used to determine final
22 compensation. For an employee who begins participating on or after
23 September 1, 2008, but prior to January 1, 2014, or who begins participating
24 in a hazardous position on or after January 1, 2026, or who is presumed
25 under Section 1 of this Act to begin participating in a hazardous position
26 immediately prior to January 1, 2014, the number of months added to the
27 employee's total service credit under this paragraph shall not exceed twelve
Page 134 of 137
XXXX 1/3/2025 4:09 PM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1007
1 (12) months, and the additional service shall not be used to determine whether
2 a member is eligible to receive a retirement allowance under KRS 78.510 to
3 78.852.
4 (6) Any city of the first class that has two (2) or more sick-leave programs for its
5 employees may purchase service credit with the retirement system for up to six (6)
6 months of unused sick leave for each retiring employee who participates in the sick-
7 leave program administered to a majority of the eligible employees of the city. An
8 employee participating in a sick-leave program administered to a minority of the
9 eligible employees shall become eligible for the purchase of service credit under
10 this subsection when the employee commences participating in the sick-leave
11 program that is administered to a majority of the eligible employees of the city.
12 (7) The provisions of this section shall not apply to:
13 (a) Employees in a nonhazardous position who begin participating in the system
14 on or after January 1, 2014;[,] or
15 (b) Employees making an election under subsection (3) of Section 1 of this Act,
16 or who, prior to the effective date of this Act, made an election under
17 Section 7 of this Act;
18 and no service credit shall be provided for accumulated sick leave balances of those
19 employees described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection[ who begin
20 participating in the system on or after January 1, 2014].
21 Section 27. KRS 78.640 is amended to read as follows:
22 (1) The members' account shall be the account to which:
23 (a) All members' contributions, or contributions picked up by the employer after
24 August 1, 1982, and interest allowances as provided in KRS 78.510 to 78.852
25 shall be credited, except as provided by KRS 78.5536(3)(b); and

20 prior to January 1, 2014, or who begins participating in a hazardous position
21 on or after January 1, 2026, for his or her service in a hazardous position,

9 member's incapacity to engage in any occupation for remuneration or
10 profit. Loss by severance of both hands at or above the wrists, or both
11 feet at or above the ankles, or one (1) hand above the wrist and one (1)
12 foot above the ankle, or the complete, irrevocable loss of the sight of
13 both eyes shall be considered as total and permanent; and
14 2. "Hazardous disability" means a disability which results in an employee's
15 total incapacity to continue as an employee in a hazardous position, but
16 the employee is not necessarily deemed to be totally and permanently
17 disabled to engage in other occupations for remuneration or profit.
18 (b) In determining whether the disability meets the requirement of this section,
19 any reasonable accommodation provided by the employer as provided in 42
20 U.S.C. sec. 12111(9) and 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630 shall be considered.
21 (c) If the board determines that the total and permanent disability of a member
22 receiving a retirement allowance under this section has ceased, then the board
23 shall determine if the member has a hazardous disability as defined by KRS
24 78.510.
25 (2) Any person may qualify to retire on disability, subject to the following:
26 (a) The person shall have sixty (60) months of service, twelve (12) of which shall
27 be current service credited under KRS 16.543(1), 61.543(1), or 78.615(1). The

1 service requirement shall be waived if the disability is a total and permanent
2 disability or a hazardous disability and is a direct result of an act in line of
3 duty;
4 (b) For a person whose membership date is prior to August 1, 2004, the person
5 shall not be eligible for an unreduced retirement allowance;
6 (c) The person's application shall be on file in the retirement office no later than
7 twenty-four (24) months after the person's last day of paid employment, as
8 defined in KRS 78.510, in a regular full-time position that has been approved
9 as a hazardous position in accordance with KRS 78.5520;
10 (d) The person shall receive a satisfactory determination pursuant to KRS 61.665;
11 and
12 (e) A person's disability application based on the same claim of incapacity shall
13 be accepted and reconsidered for disability if accompanied by new objective
14 medical evidence. The application shall be on file in the retirement office no
15 later than twenty-four (24) months after the person's last day of paid
16 employment in a regular full-time hazardous position.
17 (3) Upon the examination of the objective medical evidence by licensed physicians
18 pursuant to KRS 61.665, it shall be determined that:
19 (a) The incapacity results from bodily injury, mental illness, or disease. For
20 purposes of this section, "injury" means any physical harm or damage to the
21 human organism other than disease or mental illness;
22 (b) The incapacity is deemed to be permanent; and
23 (c) The incapacity does not result directly or indirectly from:
24 1. Injury intentionally self-inflicted while sane or insane; or
25 2. Bodily injury, mental illness, disease, or condition which pre-existed
26 membership in the system or reemployment, whichever is most recent,
27 unless:
Page 126 of 137
XXXX 1/3/2025 4:09 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1007
1 a. The disability results from bodily injury, mental illness, disease, or
2 a condition which has been substantially aggravated by an injury
3 or accident arising out of or in the course of employment; or
4 b. The person has at least sixteen (16) years' current or prior service
5 for employment with employers participating in the County
6 Employees Retirement System or the Kentucky Retirement
7 Systems.
8 For purposes of this subparagraph, "reemployment" shall not mean a
9 change of employment between employers participating in the County
10 Employees Retirement System or the Kentucky Retirement Systems
11 with no loss of service credit.
12 (4) (a) 1. An incapacity shall be deemed to be permanent for the purpose of
13 hazardous disability if it is expected to result in death or can be expected
14 to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve (12) months from
15 the person's last day of paid employment in a hazardous position.
16 2. The determination of a permanent incapacity for the purpose of
17 hazardous disability shall be based on the medical evidence contained in
18 the member's file and the member's residual functional capacity and
19 physical exertion requirements.
20 3. The determination of a total and permanent incapacity shall be based on
21 the medical evidence contained in the member's file and the member's
22 residual functional capacity.
23 (b) The person's residual functional capacity shall be the person's capacity for
24 work activity on a regular and continuing basis. The person's physical ability
25 shall be assessed in light of the severity of the person's physical, mental, and
26 other impairments. The person's ability to walk, stand, carry, push, pull, reach,
27 handle, and other physical functions shall be considered with regard to
Page 127 of 137
XXXX 1/3/2025 4:09 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1007
1 physical impairments. The person's ability to understand, remember, and carry
2 out instructions and respond appropriately to supervision, coworkers, and
3 work pressures in a work setting shall be considered with regard to mental
4 impairments. Other impairments, including skin impairments, epilepsy, visual
5 sensory impairments, postural and manipulative limitations, and
6 environmental restrictions, shall be considered in conjunction with the
7 person's physical and mental impairments to determine residual functional
8 capacity.
9 (c) The person's physical exertion requirements shall be determined based on the
10 following standards:
11 1. Sedentary work shall be work that involves lifting no more than ten (10)
12 pounds at a time and occasionally lifting or carrying articles such as
13 large files, ledgers, and small tools. Although a sedentary job primarily
14 involves sitting, occasional walking and standing may also be required
15 in the performance of duties.
16 2. Light work shall be work that involves lifting no more than twenty (20)
17 pounds at a time with frequent lifting or carrying of objects weighing up
18 to ten (10) pounds. A job shall be in this category if lifting is
19 infrequently required but walking and standing are frequently required,
20 or if the job primarily requires sitting with pushing and pulling of arm or
21 leg controls. If the person has the ability to perform substantially all of
22 these activities, the person shall be deemed capable of light work. A
23 person deemed capable of light work shall be deemed capable of
24 sedentary work unless the person has additional limitations such as the
25 loss of fine dexterity or inability to sit for long periods.
26 3. Medium work shall be work that involves lifting no more than fifty (50)
27 pounds at a time with frequent lifting or carrying of objects weighing up
Page 128 of 137
XXXX 1/3/2025 4:09 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1007
1 to twenty-five (25) pounds. If the person is deemed capable of medium
2 work, the person shall be deemed capable of light and sedentary work.
3 4. Heavy work shall be work that involves lifting no more than one
4 hundred (100) pounds at a time with frequent lifting or carrying of
5 objects weighing up to fifty (50) pounds. If the person is deemed
6 capable of heavy work, the person shall also be deemed capable of
7 medium, light, and sedentary work.
8 5. Very heavy work shall be work that involves lifting objects weighing
9 more than one hundred (100) pounds at a time with frequent lifting or
10 carrying of objects weighing fifty (50) or more pounds. If the person is
11 deemed capable of very heavy work, the person shall be deemed capable
12 of heavy, medium, light, and sedentary work.
13 (5) Upon disability retirement, an employee may receive a disability retirement
14 allowance payable during his or her lifetime which shall be:
15 (a) For a member who began participating in the system prior to August 1, 2004,
16 an annual retirement allowance payable monthly and determined in the same
17 manner as for retirement at his or her normal retirement date with years of
18 service and final compensation being determined as of the date of his or her
19 disability, except that service shall be added beginning with his or her last
20 date of paid employment and continuing to his or her fifty-fifth birthday. The
21 maximum service credit added shall not exceed the total service the member
22 had on his or her last day of paid employment, and the maximum service
23 credit for calculating his or her retirement allowance, including his or her total
24 service and service added under this section, shall not exceed twenty (20)
25 years;
26 (b) For a member who begins participating on or after August 1, 2004, but prior
27 to January 1, 2014, or who begins participating in a hazardous position on
Page 129 of 137

1 or after January 1, 2026, or who is presumed under Section 1 of this Act to
2 begin participating in a hazardous position immediately prior to January 1,
3 2014, the higher of twenty-five percent (25%) of the member's monthly final
4 rate of pay or the retirement allowance determined in the same manner as for
5 retirement at his or her normal retirement date with years of service and final
6 compensation being determined as of the date of his or her disability; or
7 (c) For a member who begins participating on or after January 1, 2014, but prior
8 to January 1, 2026, in the hybrid cash balance plan as provided by KRS
9 78.5516, who makes an election under subsection (3) of Section 1 of this
10 Act, or who, prior to the effective date of this Act, made an election under
11 Section 7 of this Act, the disability retirement allowance shall be the higher of
12 twenty-five percent (25%) of the member's monthly final rate of pay or the
13 retirement allowance determined in the same manner as for retirement at his
14 or her normal retirement date under KRS 78.5516.
15 (6) If the member receives a satisfactory determination of hazardous disability pursuant
16 to KRS 61.665 and the disability is the direct result of an act in line of duty as
17 defined in KRS 78.510, the member's retirement allowance shall be calculated as
18 follows:
19 (a) For the disabled member, benefits as provided in subsection (5) of this section
20 except that the monthly retirement allowance payable shall not be less than
21 twenty-five percent (25%) of the member's monthly final rate of pay; and
22 (b) For each dependent child of the member on his or her disability retirement
23 date, who is alive at the time any particular payment is due, a monthly
24 payment equal to ten percent (10%) of the disabled member's monthly final
25 rate of pay; however, total maximum dependent children's benefit shall not
26 exceed forty percent (40%) of the member's monthly final rate of pay. The
27 payments shall be payable to each dependent child, or to a legally appointed
Page 130 of 137

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1007
1 guardian or as directed by the system.
2 (7) If the member receives a satisfactory determination of total and permanent
3 disability pursuant to KRS 61.665 and the disability is the direct result of an act in
4 line of duty as defined in KRS 78.510, the member's retirement allowance shall be
5 calculated as follows:
6 (a) For the disabled member, the benefits as provided in subsection (5) of this
7 section, except that the monthly retirement allowance payable shall not be less
8 than seventy-five percent (75%) of the member's monthly average pay; and
9 (b) For each dependent child of the member on his or her disability retirement
10 date, who is alive at the time any particular payment is due, a monthly
11 payment equal to ten percent (10%) of the disabled member's monthly
12 average pay, except that:
13 1. Member and dependent children payments under this subsection shall
14 not exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the member's monthly
15 average pay; and
16 2. Total maximum dependent children's benefits shall not exceed twenty-
17 five percent (25%) of the member's monthly average pay while the
18 member is living and forty percent (40%) of the member's monthly
19 average pay after the member's death. The payments shall be payable to
20 each dependent child, or to a legally appointed guardian or as directed
21 by the system, and shall be divided equally among all dependent
22 children.
23 (8) No benefit provided in this section shall be reduced as a result of any change in the
24 extent of disability of any retired member who is normal retirement age or older.
25 (9) If a regular full-time member in a hazardous position has been approved for
26 benefits under a hazardous disability, the board shall, upon request of the member,
27 permit the member to receive the hazardous disability allowance while accruing
Page 131 of 137

1 benefits in a nonhazardous position, subject to proper medical review of the
2 nonhazardous position's job description by the Authority's medical examiner.
3 Section 26. KRS 78.616 is amended to read as follows:
4 (1) Any employer participating in the County Employees Retirement System which has
5 formally adopted a sick-leave program that is universally administered to its
6 employees may purchase service credit with the retirement system for up to six (6)
7 months of unused sick leave for each retiring employee.
8 (2) Participation under this section shall be at the option of each participating
9 employer. The election to participate shall be made by the governing authority of
10 the participating employer and shall be certified in writing to the system on forms
11 prescribed by the board. The certification shall provide for equal treatment of all
12 employees participating under this section.
13 (3) (a) Upon the member's notification of retirement as prescribed in KRS 61.590,
14 the employer shall certify the retiring employee's unused, accumulated sick-
15 leave balance to the system. The member's sick-leave balance, expressed in
16 days, shall be divided by the average number of working days per month in
17 county service and rounded to the nearest number of whole months. A
18 maximum of six (6) months of the member's sick-leave balance, expressed in
19 months, shall be added to his or her service credit for the purpose of
20 determining his or her annual retirement allowance under KRS 78.510 to
21 78.852 and for the purpose of determining whether the member is eligible to
22 receive a retirement allowance under KRS 78.510 to 78.852, except as
23 provided by paragraph (d) of this subsection. Accumulated sick-leave in
24 excess of six (6) months shall be added to the member's service credit if the
25 member or employer pays to the retirement system the value of the additional
26 service credit based on the formula adopted by the board, subject to the
27 restrictions provided by paragraph (d) of this subsection.

1 (b) The employer may elect to pay fifty percent (50%) of the cost of the sick
2 leave in excess of six (6) months on behalf of its employees. The employee
3 shall pay the remaining fifty percent (50%). The payment by the employer
4 shall not be deposited to the member's account. Service credit shall not be
5 credited to the member's account until both the employer's and employee's
6 payments are received by the retirement system.
7 (c) Once the employer elects to pay all or fifty percent (50%) of the cost on
8 behalf of its employees, it shall continue to pay the same portion of the cost.
9 (d) For a member who begins participating in the retirement system on or after
10 September 1, 2008, but prior to January 1, 2014, or who begins participating
11 in a hazardous position on or after January 1, 2026, or who is presumed
12 under Section 1 of this Act to begin participating in a hazardous position
13 immediately prior to January 1, 2014, whose employer has established a
14 sick-leave program under subsections (1) to (4) and (6) of this section:

20 purposes of determining the member's annual retirement allowance
21 under KRS 78.510 to 78.852;
22 3. The service added to the member's service credit shall not be used to
23 determine whether a member is eligible to receive a retirement
24 allowance under KRS 78.510 to 78.852; and
25 4. The cost of the service provided by this paragraph shall be paid by the
26 employer.
27 (4) The system shall compute the cost of the sick-leave credit of each retiring employee
Page 133 of 137

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1007
1 and bill each employer with whom the employee accrued sick leave accordingly.
2 The employer shall remit payment within thirty (30) days from receipt of the bill.
3 (5) (a) As an alternative to subsections (1), (3), (4), and (6) of this section, any
4 agency participating in the County Employees Retirement System which has
5 formally adopted a sick-leave program that is universally administered to its
6 employees, or administered to a majority of eligible employees in accordance
7 with subsection (6) of this section, shall, at the time of termination, or as
8 provided in KRS 161.155 in the case of school boards, compensate the
9 employee for unused sick-leave days the employee has accumulated which it
10 is the uniform policy of the agency to allow.
11 (b) The rate of compensation for each unused sick-leave day shall be based on the
12 daily salary rate calculated from the employee's current rate of pay. Payment
13 for unused sick-leave days shall be incorporated into the employee's final
14 compensation if the employee and employer make the regular employee and
15 employer contributions, respectively, on the sick-leave payment.
16 (c) The number of sick-leave days for which the employee is compensated shall
17 be divided by the average number of working days per month in county
18 service and rounded to the nearest number of whole months. This number of
19 months shall be added to the employee's total service credit and to the number
20 of months used to determine creditable compensation, pursuant to KRS
21 78.510, but no more than sixty (60) months shall be used to determine final
22 compensation. For an employee who begins participating on or after
23 September 1, 2008, but prior to January 1, 2014, or who begins participating
24 in a hazardous position on or after January 1, 2026, or who is presumed
25 under Section 1 of this Act to begin participating in a hazardous position
26 immediately prior to January 1, 2014, the number of months added to the
27 employee's total service credit under this paragraph shall not exceed twelve

1 (12) months, and the additional service shall not be used to determine whether
2 a member is eligible to receive a retirement allowance under KRS 78.510 to
3 78.852.
4 (6) Any city of the first class that has two (2) or more sick-leave programs for its
5 employees may purchase service credit with the retirement system for up to six (6)
6 months of unused sick leave for each retiring employee who participates in the sick-
7 leave program administered to a majority of the eligible employees of the city. An
8 employee participating in a sick-leave program administered to a minority of the
9 eligible employees shall become eligible for the purchase of service credit under
10 this subsection when the employee commences participating in the sick-leave
11 program that is administered to a majority of the eligible employees of the city.
12 (7) The provisions of this section shall not apply to:
13 (a) Employees in a nonhazardous position who begin participating in the system
14 on or after January 1, 2014;[,] or
15 (b) Employees making an election under subsection (3) of Section 1 of this Act,

17 Section 7 of this Act;
18 and no service credit shall be provided for accumulated sick leave balances of those
19 employees described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection[ who begin
20 participating in the system on or after January 1, 2014].
21 Section 27. KRS 78.640 is amended to read as follows:
22 (1) The members' account shall be the account to which:
23 (a) All members' contributions, or contributions picked up by the employer after
24 August 1, 1982, and interest allowances as provided in KRS 78.510 to 78.852
25 shall be credited, except as provided by KRS 78.5536(3)(b); and
