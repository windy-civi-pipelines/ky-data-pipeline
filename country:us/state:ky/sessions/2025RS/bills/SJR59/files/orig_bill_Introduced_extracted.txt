8 to serve as the need arose; and
9 WHEREAS, for the next 250 years, as the Commonwealth and this great nation

13 WHEREAS, this volunteer citizens army has also served in times of national
14 disaster with diligence and compassion, as victims of the 2021 tornadoes in western
15 Kentucky, 2022 eastern Kentucky flooding, and myriad other disasters can attest; and
