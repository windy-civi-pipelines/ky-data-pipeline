2 representing the United States Marine Corps in faithful service to the United States of
3 America.
4 WHEREAS, November 10, 1775, is the celebrated day on which the United States
5 Marine Corps was established to add to the United States naval forces founded that same
6 year. The Continental Congress ordered that a number of Marines be raised to serve as
7 landing forces with the United States Navy; and
8 WHEREAS, the United States Marine Corps has participated in all wars of the
9 United States, executed more than 300 landings on foreign shores, and served in all major
10 Unites States naval actions since its founding; and
11 WHEREAS, many Marines proudly call Kentucky home, and the Commonwealth
12 proudly embraces them in return; and
13 WHEREAS, two particularly notable Marines, Lieutenant Presley N. O'Bannon and
14 Private First Class Franklin R. Sousley, have Kentucky connections; and
15 WHEREAS, in the early 1800s during the United States' war with Tripoli,
16 Lieutenant Presley N. O'Bannon was part of the assault force taking the city of Derna in
17 Africa, where Hamet, the elder brother of the sovereign leader of Tripoli and an ally of
18 the United States in the war, presented Lieutenant O'Bannon with a jeweled sword with a
19 Mameluke hilt. Lieutenant O'Bannon was subsequently presented a replica of this sword,
20 which became the model of all ceremonial swords worn by United States Marine Corps
21 officers with their dress uniforms. Lieutenant O'Bannon, a native of Virginia, later moved
22 to Kentucky, and his remains, originally interred in Henry County, Kentucky, were
23 moved to Frankfort in Franklin County as part of a memorial to his service. Lieutenant
24 O'Bannon's and other Marines' actions "on the shores of Tripoli" are now famously part
25 of the Marines' Hymn; and
26 WHEREAS, in the hard-won Battle of Iwo Jima at the conclusion of the United
27 States' involvement in the Pacific Theatre in World War II, Fleming County, Kentucky,

1 native Private First Class Franklin R. Sousley became one of flag raisers on Mount
2 Suribachi, a moment that was memorialized in the famous photo taken by Joe Rosenthal.
3 Private First Class Franklin R. Sousley would later give his life in service to his fellow
4 Marines and his country in that same battle; and
5 WHEREAS, this year marks the 250th anniversary of the founding of the United
6 States Marine Corps, and the Marine Corps Coordinating Council of Kentucky is
7 celebrating with "Resolved Fidelity Campaign" events throughout the year to
8 commemorate the anniversary and honor Marines, past and present, from Kentucky and
9 beyond. One event of note is the Freedom Run, in which Marine officer candidates and
10 other Marines participate in a 70-mile relay from Private First Class Franklin R. Sousley's
11 grave to Lieutenant Presley N. O'Bannon's grave, a past Freedom Flag Run tradition that
12 is being reinstituted on September 17, 2025, in conjunction with Citizenship Day as
13 celebrated on September 17 of each year and Constitution Week as requested by
14 Congress to be celebrated beginning on September 17 and ending September 23 of each
15 year;
16 NOW, THEREFORE,
17 Be it resolved by the Senate of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of
18 Kentucky:
19 Section 1. This august body does hereby recognize and honor all members of
20 the United States Marine Corps that hail from, serve from, or otherwise settle in
21 Kentucky for their honorable service and making contributions to the Commonwealth of
22 Kentucky's role in maintaining the constitutional republic of the United States of America
23 during this, the 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States Marine Corps.
24 Section 2. The Clerk of the Senate is directed to transmit a copy of this
25 Resolution to Senator Aaron Reed for presentation to the Board of Directors of the
26 Marine Corps Coordinating Council of Kentucky.
