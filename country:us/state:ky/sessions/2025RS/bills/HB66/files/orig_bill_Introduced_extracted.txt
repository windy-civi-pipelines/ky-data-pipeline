1 (7) Develop plans that may be required by federal legislation. The council shall for all
2 purposes of federal legislation relating to planning be considered the "single state

13 residents, the council shall consider the fees required of Kentucky students by
14 institutions in adjoining states, the resident fees charged by other states, the
15 total actual per student cost of training in the institutions for which the fees

17 students comprising the enrollments of the respective institutions, and other
18 factors the council may in its sole discretion deem pertinent, except that the
19 Kentucky Community and Technical College System may assess a mandatory
20 student fee not to exceed eight dollars ($8) per credit hour to be used
21 exclusively for debt service on amounts not to exceed seventy-five percent
22 (75%) of the total projects cost of the Kentucky Community and Technical
23 College System agency bond projects included in 2014 Ky. Acts ch. 117, Part
24 II, J., 11.
25 (b) The Kentucky Community and Technical College System mandatory fee

6 representation of the two (2) sexes by appointing a member of the sex

1 AN ACT relating to the Council on Postsecondary Education.
2 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
3 ïƒ¢Section 1. KRS 164.020 is amended to read as follows:
4 The Council on Postsecondary Education in Kentucky shall:
5 (1) Develop and implement the strategic agenda with the advice and counsel of the
6 Strategic Committee on Postsecondary Education. The council shall provide for and
7 direct the planning process and subsequent strategic implementation plans based on
8 the strategic agenda as provided in KRS 164.0203;
9 (2) Revise the strategic agenda and strategic implementation plan with the advice and
10 counsel of the committee as set forth in KRS 164.004;
11 (3) Develop a system of public accountability related to the strategic agenda by
12 evaluating the performance and effectiveness of the state's postsecondary system.
13 The council shall prepare a report in conjunction with the accountability reporting
14 described in KRS 164.095, which shall be submitted to the committee, the
15 Governor, and the General Assembly by December 1 annually. This report shall
16 include a description of contributions by postsecondary institutions to the quality of
17 elementary and secondary education in the Commonwealth;
18 (4) Review, revise, and approve the missions of the state's universities and the
19 Kentucky Community and Technical College System. The Council on
20 Postsecondary Education shall have the final authority to determine the compliance
21 of postsecondary institutions with their academic, service, and research missions;
22 (5) Establish and ensure that all postsecondary institutions in Kentucky cooperatively
23 provide for an integrated system of postsecondary education. The council shall
24 guard against inappropriate and unnecessary conflict and duplication by promoting

1 (7) Develop plans that may be required by federal legislation. The council shall for all
2 purposes of federal legislation relating to planning be considered the "single state
3 agency" as that term may be used in federal legislation. When federal legislation
4 requires additional representation on any "single state agency," the Council on
5 Postsecondary Education shall establish advisory groups necessary to satisfy federal
6 legislative or regulatory guidelines;
7 (8) (a) Determine tuition and approve the minimum qualifications for admission to
8 the state postsecondary educational system. In defining residency, the council
9 shall classify a student as having Kentucky residency if the student met the
10 residency requirements at the beginning of his or her last year in high school
11 and enters a Kentucky postsecondary education institution within two (2)
12 years of high school graduation. In determining the tuition for non-Kentucky
13 residents, the council shall consider the fees required of Kentucky students by
14 institutions in adjoining states, the resident fees charged by other states, the
15 total actual per student cost of training in the institutions for which the fees
16 are being determined, and the ratios of Kentucky students to non-Kentucky
17 students comprising the enrollments of the respective institutions, and other
18 factors the council may in its sole discretion deem pertinent, except that the
19 Kentucky Community and Technical College System may assess a mandatory
20 student fee not to exceed eight dollars ($8) per credit hour to be used
21 exclusively for debt service on amounts not to exceed seventy-five percent
22 (75%) of the total projects cost of the Kentucky Community and Technical
23 College System agency bond projects included in 2014 Ky. Acts ch. 117, Part
24 II, J., 11.
25 (b) The Kentucky Community and Technical College System mandatory fee
26 established in this subsection shall only be used for debt service on agency
27 bond projects.

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 231
1 (c) Any fee established as provided by this subsection shall cease to be assessed
2 upon the retirement of the project bonds for which it services debt.
3 (d) Prior to the issuance of any bonds, the Kentucky Community and Technical
4 College System shall certify in writing to the secretary of the Finance and
5 Administration Cabinet that sufficient funds have been raised to meet the
6 local match equivalent to twenty-five percent (25%) of the total project cost;
7 (9) Devise, establish, and periodically review and revise policies to be used in making
8 recommendations to the Governor for consideration in developing
9 recommendations to the General Assembly for appropriations to the universities,
10 the Kentucky Community and Technical College System, and to support strategies
11 for persons to maintain necessary levels of literacy throughout their lifetimes. The
12 council has sole discretion, with advice of the Strategic Committee on
13 Postsecondary Education and the executive officers of the postsecondary education
14 system, to devise policies that provide for allocation of funds among the
15 universities and the Kentucky Community and Technical College System;
16 (10) Lead and provide staff support for the biennial budget process as provided under
17 KRS Chapter 48, in cooperation with the committee;
18 (11) (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, review and approve all
19 capital construction projects covered by KRS 45.750(1)(f), including real
20 property acquisitions, and regardless of the source of funding for projects or
21 acquisitions. Approval of capital projects and real property acquisitions shall
22 be on a basis consistent with the strategic agenda and the mission of the
23 respective universities and the Kentucky Community and Technical College
24 System.
25 (b) The organized groups that are establishing community college satellites as
26 branches of existing community colleges in the counties of Laurel, Leslie, and
27 Muhlenberg, and that have substantially obtained cash, pledges, real property,

1 or other commitments to build the satellite at no cost to the Commonwealth,
2 other than operating costs that shall be paid as part of the operating budget of
3 the main community college of which the satellite is a branch, are authorized
4 to begin construction of the satellite on or after January 1, 1998;
5 (12) Require reports from the executive officer of each institution it deems necessary for
6 the effectual performance of its duties;
7 (13) Ensure that the state postsecondary system does not unnecessarily duplicate
8 services and programs provided by private postsecondary institutions and shall
9 promote maximum cooperation between the state postsecondary system and private
10 postsecondary institutions. Receive and consider an annual report prepared by the
11 Association of Independent Kentucky Colleges and Universities stating the
12 condition of independent institutions, listing opportunities for more collaboration
13 between the state and independent institutions and other information as appropriate;
14 (14) Establish course credit, transfer, and degree components as required in KRS
15 164.2951;
16 (15) Define and approve the offering of all postsecondary education technical, associate,
17 baccalaureate, graduate, and professional degree, certificate, or diploma programs
18 in the public postsecondary education institutions. The council shall expedite
19 wherever possible the approval of requests from the Kentucky Community and
20 Technical College System board of regents relating to new certificate, diploma,
21 technical, or associate degree programs of a vocational-technical and occupational
22 nature. Without the consent of the General Assembly, the council shall not abolish
23 or limit the total enrollment of the general program offered at any community
24 college to meet the goal of reasonable access throughout the Commonwealth to a
25 two (2) year course of general studies designed for transfer to a baccalaureate
26 program. This does not restrict or limit the authority of the council, as set forth in
27 this section, to eliminate or make changes in individual programs within that

23 promulgated by the council, those institutions not meeting the goals shall be able to
24 obtain a temporary waiver, if the institution has made substantial progress toward
25 meeting its equal educational opportunity goals;

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 231
1 (1) There is hereby created and established a Council on Postsecondary Education in
2 Kentucky as an agency, instrumentality, and political subdivision of the
3 Commonwealth and a public body corporate and politic having all powers, duties,
4 and responsibilities as are provided to it by law, appointed for a term set by law
5 pursuant to Section 23 of the Constitution of Kentucky. The council shall be
6 composed of the commissioner of education, a faculty member, a student member,
7 and thirteen (13) citizen members appointed by the Governor. The citizen members
8 shall be confirmed by the Senate under KRS 11.160, and the commissioner of
9 education shall serve as a nonvoting ex officio member. Citizen council members
10 shall be selected from a list of nominees provided to the Governor under the
11 nominating process set forth in KRS 164.005. If the General Assembly is not in
12 session at the time of the appointment, persons appointed shall serve prior to

14 regular session or at an intervening extraordinary session if the matter is included in
15 the call of the General Assembly.
16 (2) By no later than thirty (30) days after May 30, 1997, the Governor's Postsecondary

24 that appointments reflect the minority racial composition of the Commonwealth
25 based on the total minority racial population using the most recent census or
26 estimate data from the United States Census Bureau. If the determination of
27 proportional minority representation does not result in a whole number of minority

7 section. Vacancies on the council shall be filled for the unexpired term in
8 accordance with the procedures established for the original appointments.
