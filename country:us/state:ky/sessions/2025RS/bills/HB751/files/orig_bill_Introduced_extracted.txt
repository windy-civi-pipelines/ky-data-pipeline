11 (b) "Fetal viability" means the point in pregnancy when, in the professional

13 the case, there is a significant likelihood of the fetus's sustained survival outside the
14 uterus without the application of extraordinary medical measures.
15 Section 3. This amendment shall be submitted to the voters of the
16 Commonwealth for their ratification or rejection at the time and in the manner provided
