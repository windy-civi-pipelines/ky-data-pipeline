4 (1) If, in any contract in the amount of two million[five hundred thousand] dollars
5 ($2,000,000)[($500,000)] or more involving the improvement of real estate, a
6 certain amount or percentage of the contract is held back by the owner, that retained
7 amount shall be deposited in a separate escrow account with a bank or trust

9 (2) As of the time of the deposit of the retained funds, they shall become the sole and
10 separate property of the contractor to whom they are owed.

12 selected by the escrow agent in its discretion.

15 interest thereon, shall be paid immediately to the contractor to whom it is owed.
16 (5) The escrow agent shall be compensated for its services in an amount agreed to by

20 escrow account.
21 (6) In the event the owner fails or refuses to execute the release provided for in
22 subsection (4) of this section, then the contractor shall have a cause of action

4 371.410.
5 (2) The following provisions in a contract for construction shall be against the public
6 policy of this Commonwealth and shall be void and unenforceable:
7 (a) A provision that purports to waive, release, or extinguish the right to resolve
8 disputes through litigation in court or substantive or procedural rights in
9 connection with such litigation, except that a contract may require binding
