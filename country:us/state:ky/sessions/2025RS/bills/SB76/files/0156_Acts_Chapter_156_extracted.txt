require binding arbitration as a substitute for litigation or require nonbinding alternative dispute
resolution as a prerequisite to litigation;
(b) A provision that purports to waive, release, or extinguish rights provided by KRS Chapter 376, with the
exception of partial waivers of lien rights provided by the contractor or subcontractor for progress
payments;[ or]

Unusually bad weather that cannot be reasonably anticipated, fire, or other act of God shall not
automatically entitle the contractor to additional compensation under this paragraph.
