5 maintaining a sustainable and equitable funding structure for the medical insurance fund
6 that supports retired educators; and
7 WHEREAS, in 2010, the General Assembly passed House Bill 540, which

9 insurance trust fund by implementing a funding mechanism that included contributions
10 from active teachers, school districts, and other employers, and the state; and
11 WHEREAS, the shared responsibility solution has provided stability to the medical
12 insurance fund, but continued review is necessary to ensure its long-term viability and
13 effectiveness in meeting the healthcare needs of retirees and how those benefits are
14 funded in an actuarially acceptable manner in the future; and
15 WHEREAS, the medical insurance fund is projected to achieve full actuarial
16 funding by 2027 under current projections, at which time a reevaluation of contribution
17 requirements and overall sustainability measures will be necessary to guide future policy
18 decisions; and

20 of legislative members, with input from a diverse group of stakeholders, including
21 representatives from education organizations, retirement systems, and the General
22 Assembly, to study potential next steps and recommend improvements to the plan;
23 NOW, THEREFORE,
