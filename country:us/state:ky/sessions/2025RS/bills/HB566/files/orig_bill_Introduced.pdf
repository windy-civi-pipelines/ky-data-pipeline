2 procedures for receiving and investigating complaints in an expeditious manner.

4 (a) Inspect and examine all premises in which or on which charitable gaming is
5 conducted or charitable gaming supplies or equipment are manufactured or
6 distributed;
7 (b) Seize and remove from premises and impound charitable gaming supplies and

1 violations and the nature, severity, and frequency of the offense.

3 criminal penalties provided in this chapter or under other provisions of law.
4 (d) 1. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, the office shall
5 review, within two (2) months of receipt, timely filed organization
6 quarterly reports that include payment of the fee due as reflected on the
7 organization quarterly report. If the office discovers reporting errors that
8 are not willful, the office shall, prior to taking any other administrative
9 action, issue a letter of warning to the licensee and allow the licensee

14 quarterly report so that the errors are corrected and are not repeated in
15 subsequent organization quarterly reports.
16 2. A review conducted under subparagraph 1. of this paragraph shall not be
17 considered an audit or final review and acceptance of an organization
18 quarterly report and payment. The office shall have four (4) years from

20 report, and may pursue administrative actions against the licensee
21 related to an organization quarterly report or the information reported on
22 an organization quarterly report within the four (4) year period if
23 violations or errors that are not willful are discovered. This
24 subparagraph shall not be construed to require records that are not
25 needed to audit or review an organization quarterly report to be kept
26 longer than is required elsewhere in this chapter or in any related
27 administrative regulations.

5 a. Identify the violation;
6 b. Describe the corrective action necessary;
7 c. Identify the administrative actions that can be taken if the violation
8 is not addressed; and
9 d. Provide that the person shall have thirty (30) days to correct the
10 action leading to the violation.
11 (4) The office may reinstate a license that has been revoked at any time after two (2)
12 years from the date of revocation. A license may be reinstated only upon a finding
13 that the violations for which the license was revoked have been corrected.
14 (5) All departments, divisions, boards, agencies, officers, and institutions of the
15 Commonwealth of Kentucky and all subdivisions thereof, in particular local law
16 enforcement entities, shall cooperate with the office in carrying out its enforcement
17 responsibilities.
18 (6) The office shall report any activity or action which would constitute a criminal
19 offense to the appropriate authorities in the county where the activity or action
20 occurred and to the Attorney General.
