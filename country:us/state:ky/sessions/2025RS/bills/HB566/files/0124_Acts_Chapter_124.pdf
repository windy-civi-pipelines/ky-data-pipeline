deposited into one checking account devoted exclusively to charitable gaming. This checking account shall be
designated the "charitable gaming account," and the licensed charitable organization shall maintain its account
at a financial institution located in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. No other funds may be deposited or
transferred into the charitable gaming account.
(3) All payments for charitable gaming expenses, payments made for prizes purchased, and any charitable
donations from charitable gaming receipts shall be made from the charitable gaming account and the payments
or donations shall be made only by bona fide officers of the organization by checks having preprinted
consecutive numbers and made payable to specific persons or organizations. No check drawn on the charitable
gaming account may be made payable to "cash," or "bearer," except that a licensed charitable organization
may withdraw start-up funds for a charitable gaming event or session from the charitable gaming account by
check made payable to "cash" or "bearer," if these start-up funds are redeposited into the charitable gaming
account together with all adjusted gross receipts derived from the particular event or session. Checks shall be
imprinted with the words "charitable gaming account" and shall contain the organization's license number on
the face of each check. Payments for charitable gaming expenses, prizes purchased, and charitable donations
may be made by electronic funds transfer if the payments are made to specific persons or organizations. The
corporation may by administrative regulation adopt alternative reporting requirements for charitable gaming of
limited scope or duration, if these requirements are sufficient to ensure accountability for all moneys handled.
(4) A licensed charitable organization shall expend net receipts exclusively for purposes consistent with the
charitable, religious, educational, literary, civic, fraternal, or patriotic functions or objectives for which the
licensed charitable organization received and maintains federal tax-exempt status, or consistent with its status
as a local school district, a common school, an institution of higher education, or a state college or university.
No net receipts shall inure to the private benefit or financial gain of any individual.
(5) Accurate records and books shall be maintained by each organization exempt from licensure under KRS
238.535(1) and each licensed charitable organization for a period of three (3) years. Office staff shall have
access to these records at reasonable times. Licensed charitable organizations and exempt organizations shall
maintain their charitable gaming records at their offices or places of business within the Commonwealth of
Kentucky as identified in their license applications or applications for exempt status. An exempt organization
shall submit a yearly financial report in accordance with KRS 238.535(2), and failure to file this report shall
constitute grounds for revocation of the organization's exempt status.
(6) All licensed charitable organizations that have annual gross receipts of two hundred thousand dollars
($200,000) or less and do not have a weekly bingo session shall report to the office annually at the time and on
a form established in administrative regulations promulgated by the corporation.

(7) All other licensed charitable organizations shall submit reports to the office at least quarterly at the time and on
a form established in administrative regulations promulgated by the corporation.
(8) Failure by a licensed charitable organization to file reports required under this chapter shall constitute grounds
for revocation of the organization's license or denial of the organization's application to renew its license in
accordance with KRS 238.560(3). Reports filed by a licensed charitable organization shall include but shall
not be limited to the following information:
(a) All gross receipts received from charitable gaming for the reporting period, classified by type of gaming
activity;
(b) The names and addresses of all persons who are winners of prizes having a fair market value of six
hundred dollars ($600) or more;
(c) All expenses paid and the names and addresses of all persons to whom expenses were paid;
(d) All net receipts retained and the names and addresses of all charitable endeavors that received money
from the net receipts; and
(e) Any other information the office deems appropriate.
(9) No licensed charitable organization shall incur charitable gaming expenses, except as provided in this chapter.
No licensed charitable organization shall be permitted to expend amounts in excess of prevailing market rates
for the following charitable gaming expenses:
(a) Charitable gaming supplies and equipment;
(b) Rent;
(c) Utilities;
(d) Insurance;
(e) Advertising;
(f) Janitorial services;
(g) Bookkeeping and accounting services;
(h) Security services;
(i) Membership dues for its participation in any charitable gaming trade organization; and
(j) Any other expenses the corporation may determine by administrative regulation to be legitimate.
(10) No licensed charitable organization shall expend receipts from charitable gaming activities nor incur expenses
to form, maintain, or operate as a labor organization.
(11) For the purposes of deposits under subsection (2) of this section, a licensed charitable organization conducting
charitable gaming events or sessions shall only be required to deposit its gross receipts and adjusted gross
receipts one (1) time per week if the following conditions are met:
(a) The charitable gaming involves only games using charity game tickets;
(b) The charitable gaming is not part of a charity fundraising event; and
(c) The licensed charitable organization's deposits of gross receipts and adjusted gross receipts from
charitable gaming total less than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) in the week prior to the
deposit.
Section 48. KRS 238.560 (Effective July 1, 2025) is amended to read as follows:
(1) The office may investigate allegations of wrongdoing upon complaint or upon its own volition. The
corporation by administrative regulation may[shall] establish procedures for receiving and investigating
complaints in an expeditious manner.
(2) In carrying out its enforcement responsibilities, the office may:
(a) Inspect and examine all premises in which or on which charitable gaming is conducted or charitable
gaming supplies or equipment are manufactured or distributed;

CHAPTER 124 61
(b) Seize and remove from premises and impound charitable gaming supplies and equipment for the
purposes of examination and inspection pursuant to an appropriate court order;
(c) Demand access to, inspect, and audit books and records of licensees for the purpose of determining
compliance with laws and the corporation's administrative regulations relative to charitable gaming;
and
(d) Conduct in-depth audits and investigations, when warranted.
(3) (a) As used in this subsection, "willful" means that the conduct constituting the violation was committed
with intent, not accidentally or inadvertently.
(b) The office may take appropriate administrative action against any person licensed under this chapter for
any violation of the provisions of this chapter or administrative regulations promulgated thereunder
subject to the conditions established by this subsection.
(c) The office may deny a license, suspend or revoke a license, issue a cease and desist order, place a
license holder on probation, issue a letter of reprimand or letter of warning, and levy a fine. An
administrative fine shall not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each offense. The office may
deny the issuance of a license or a license renewal if the applicant or licensee has failed to pay a fine
levied by the office. The corporation may[shall] by administrative regulation classify types of offenses
and the recommended administrative action. The type of action to be taken shall be based on the history
of previous violations and the nature, severity, and frequency of the offense. Administrative action
authorized in this section shall be in addition to any criminal penalties provided in this chapter or under
other provisions of law.
(d) 1. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, the office shall review, within two (2)
months of receipt, timely filed organization quarterly reports that include payment of the fee due
as reflected on the organization quarterly report. If the office discovers reporting errors that are
not willful, the office shall, prior to taking any other administrative action, issue a letter of
warning to the licensee and allow the licensee thirty (30) days from the issuance of the letter to
correct the identified violation. The purpose of this subparagraph is for the office to identify
correctable reporting errors in a timely manner, and to notify the licensee of the errors prior to
the due date of the next organization quarterly report so that the errors are corrected and are not
repeated in subsequent organization quarterly reports.
2. A review conducted under subparagraph 1. of this paragraph shall not be considered an audit or
final review and acceptance of an organization quarterly report and payment. The office shall
have four (4) years from the date of filing to fully audit and review an organization quarterly
report, and may pursue administrative actions against the licensee related to an organization
quarterly report or the information reported on an organization quarterly report within the four
(4) year period if violations or errors that are not willful are discovered. This subparagraph shall
not be construed to require records that are not needed to audit or review an organization
quarterly report to be kept longer than is required elsewhere in this chapter or in any related
administrative regulations.
3. Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph 2. of this paragraph, for a violation that is
determined to be willful, the office may pursue the administrative actions authorized by this
section at any time.
4. A letter of warning issued under this section shall:
a. Identify the violation;
b. Describe the corrective action necessary;
c. Identify the administrative actions that can be taken if the violation is not addressed; and
d. Provide that the person shall have thirty (30) days to correct the action leading to the
violation.
(4) The office may reinstate a license that has been revoked at any time after two (2) years from the date of
revocation. A license may be reinstated only upon a finding that the violations for which the license was
revoked have been corrected.
