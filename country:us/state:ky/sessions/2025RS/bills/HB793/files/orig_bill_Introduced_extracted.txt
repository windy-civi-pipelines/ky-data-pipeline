17 practitioner or women's healthcare practitioner within a reasonable period
18 of time after provision of the hormonal contraceptive; and
19 (f) Either dispense the hormonal contraceptive or refer the patient to a

24 pharmacist from requiring a patient to schedule an appointment with the
25 pharmacist for the provision or dispensing of a hormonal contraceptive.

27 administrative fee for services provided pursuant to this section in addition
Page 28 of 31

8 contraceptive and the price of the administrative fee charged. This
9 limitation is not intended to interfere with other contractually agreed-upon

23 shall be immune from disciplinary or adverse administrative actions under this
24 chapter for acts or omissions related to the provision of a hormonal
25 contraceptive.
26 (9) A pharmacist or prescriber involved in the provision of hormonal contraceptives

1 results from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the pharmacist or
2 provider.

4 contraceptive issued by an authorized prescriber and dispensed by a pharmacist
5 pursuant to the valid prescription.

12 (2) For purposes of 45 C.F.R. sec. 155.170, the benefits required under Section 2
13 of this Act are intended to be, and shall be considered by the state as, a benefit required

1 qualified health plan (QHP) is in addition to the essential health benefits required under
2 federal law.
3 (2) If it is determined that the application of any requirement of Section 2 of this
4 Act to a QHP is in addition to the essential health benefits required under federal law,
5 then the department shall, within 180 days of the effective date of this section, apply for a
6 waiver under 42 U.S.C. sec. 18052, as amended, or any other applicable federal law of all

16 within 90 days after the effective date of this section, request the waiver or authorization,
17 and may only delay implementation of those provisions for which a waiver or
18 authorization was deemed necessary until the waiver or authorization is granted.

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 55
1 AN ACT relating to reproductive health services.
2 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
3 SECTION 1. A NEW SECTION OF KRS CHAPTER 211 IS CREATED TO
4 READ AS FOLLOWS:
5 (1) As used in this section:
6 (a) "Contraception" means an action taken to prevent pregnancy, including
7 the use of contraceptives or fertility-awareness based methods and
8 sterilization procedures; and
9 (b) "Contraceptive" means any drug, device, or biological product intended for
10 use in the prevention of pregnancy, whether specifically intended to prevent
11 pregnancy or for other health needs, that is legally marketed under the
12 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, such as oral contraceptives, long-
13 acting reversible contraceptives, emergency contraceptives, internal and
14 external condoms, injectables, vaginal barrier methods, transdermal
15 patches, and vaginal rings, or other contraceptives.
16 (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, a person has a
17 statutory right to obtain contraceptives and to engage in contraception, and a
18 health care provider practicing in any place in the Commonwealth, including
19 institutions of higher education, has a corresponding right to provide
20 contraceptives, contraception, referrals, services, and information related to
21 contraception.
22 (3) The statutory rights specified in subsection (2) of this section shall not be limited
23 or otherwise infringed upon through any limitation or requirement that:
24 (a) Expressly, effectively, implicitly, or as implemented singles out:
25 1. The provision or sale of contraceptives, contraception, or information
26 related to contraception;
27 2. Health care providers who provide or dispense contraceptives,

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 55
1 contraception, or information related to contraception; or
2 3. Facilities in which contraceptives, contraception, or information
3 related to contraception is provided or dispensed; or
4 (b) Impedes or prohibits the sale or access to contraceptives, contraception, or
5 information related to contraception.
6 (4) To defend against a claim that a limitation or requirement violates a health care
7 provider's or patient's rights under subsection (2) of this section, a party must
8 establish by clear and convincing evidence that:
9 (a) The limitation or requirement significantly advances access to
10 contraceptives, contraception, and information related to contraception;
11 and
12 (b) Access to contraceptives, contraception, and information related to
13 contraception or the health of patients cannot be advanced by a less
14 restrictive alternative measure or action.
15 (5) The Commonwealth or its localities shall not administer, implement, or enforce
16 any law, administrative regulation, or other provision having the force and effect
17 of law that conflicts with any provision of this section, notwithstanding any
18 provision of federal law, including the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of
19 1993, including:
20 (a) Prohibiting or restricting the sale, provision, or use of any contraceptives;
21 (b) Prohibiting or restricting any individual from aiding another individual in
22 voluntarily obtaining or using any contraceptives or contraception; or
23 (c) Exempting any contraceptives or contraception from any other generally
24 applicable law in a way that would make it more difficult to sell, provide,
25 obtain, or use such contraceptives or contraception, including over-the-
26 counter sales.
27 (6) The Attorney General may commence a civil action on behalf of the
Page 2 of 31
XXXX 9/13/2024 2:57 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 55
1 Commonwealth against any locality that implements or enforces any limitation or
2 requirement that violates this section, or against any person who implements or
3 enforces any limitation or requirement that violates this section. The court shall
4 hold unlawful and set aside the limitation or requirement if it is in violation of
5 this section.
6 (7) The following private rights of action shall be available under this section:
7 (a) Any individual or entity, including any health care provider or patient,
8 adversely affected by an alleged violation of this section may commence a
9 civil action against the Commonwealth or any locality that implements or
10 enforces any limitation or requirement that violates this section or against
11 any person who implements or enforces any limitation or requirement that
12 violates this section; and
13 (b) A health care provider may commence an action for relief on its own
14 behalf, on behalf of the provider's staff, and on behalf of the provider's
15 patients who are or may be adversely affected by an alleged violation of this
16 section.
17 (8) In any action under this section, the court may award appropriate equitable
18 relief, including temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive relief.
19 (9) In any action under this section, the court shall award costs of litigation, as well
20 as reasonable attorney fees, to any prevailing plaintiff. A plaintiff shall not be
21 liable to a defendant for costs or attorney's fees in any nonfrivolous action under
22 this section.
23 (10) An action under this section shall be filed in Circuit Court. The Circuit Court
24 shall exercise jurisdiction without regard to whether the aggrieved party has
25 exhausted any administrative or other remedies that may be provided for by law.
26 (11) A locality that enforces or maintains any limitation or requirement that violates
27 this section, or a government official, including any person who is permitted to
Page 3 of 31

13 U.S.C. sec. 18021(a)(1), as amended.
14 (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter:
15 (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, if the application of a

14 care coverage under this section to submit bids that may vary county by county or
15 by larger geographic areas.
16 (20) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the bid for proposals for health
17 insurance coverage for calendar year 2004 shall include a bid scenario that reflects
18 the statewide rating structure provided in calendar year 2003 and a bid scenario that
19 allows for a regional rating structure that allows carriers to submit bids that may
20 vary by region for a given product offering as described in this subsection:
21 (a) The regional rating bid scenario shall not include a request for bid on a
22 statewide option;
23 (b) The Personnel Cabinet shall divide the state into geographical regions which

7 contract for that region to no more than two (2) carriers; and
8 (e) Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit the Personnel Cabinet from including
9 other requirements or criteria in the request for proposal.

26 specific act or refusal to act and has used the least restrictive means to further that
27 interest. A "burden" shall include indirect burdens such as withholding benefits,

15 5. Other costs and benefits as a result of the program.
16 SECTION 10. A NEW SECTION OF KRS CHAPTER 315 IS CREATED TO
17 READ AS FOLLOWS:
18 (1) As used in this section, "hormonal contraceptive" means a self-administered
19 drug, or a transdermal patch applied to the skin of a patient by the patient or by a
20 practitioner, that releases a drug composed of a combination of hormones
21 approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration to prevent
22 pregnancy.
23 (2) A pharmacist, acting in good faith, is authorized to provide hormonal
24 contraceptives according to a valid collaborative care agreement containing a
25 nonpatient-specific prescriptive order and standardized procedures developed and
26 executed by one (1) or more authorized prescribers.
27 (3) The board, in collaboration with the Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure, shall
Page 27 of 31
XXXX 9/13/2024 2:57 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 55
1 promulgate administrative regulations in accordance with KRS Chapter 13A to
2 establish standard procedures for the provision of hormonal contraceptives by
3 pharmacists. The standard procedures adopted pursuant to this section shall
4 require a pharmacist to:
5 (a) Complete a training program approved by the Cabinet for Health and
6 Family Services related to the provision of hormonal contraceptives;
7 (b) Provide the patient with a self-screening risk assessment tool developed or
8 approved by the Cabinet for Health and Family Services;
9 (c) Provide the patient with documentation about the hormonal contraceptive
10 that was provided to the patient and advise the patient to consult with a

13 limited to the indications and contraindications for use of the drug,
14 appropriate method for using the drug, importance of a medical follow-up,
15 and other appropriate information;
16 (e) Provide the patient with the contact information of a primary care
17 practitioner or women's healthcare practitioner within a reasonable period
18 of time after provision of the hormonal contraceptive; and
19 (f) Either dispense the hormonal contraceptive or refer the patient to a
20 pharmacy that may dispense the hormonal contraceptive as soon as
21 practicable after the pharmacist determines that the patient should receive
22 the medication.
23 (4) The administrative regulations promulgated under this section shall prohibit a
24 pharmacist from requiring a patient to schedule an appointment with the
25 pharmacist for the provision or dispensing of a hormonal contraceptive.
26 (5) (a) A pharmacist or the pharmacist's employer or agent may charge the annual
27 administrative fee for services provided pursuant to this section in addition
Page 28 of 31
XXXX 9/13/2024 2:57 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 55
1 to any costs associated with the dispensing of the drug and paid by the
2 pharmacy insurance benefit.
3 (b) Upon an oral, telephonic, electronic, or written request from a patient or
4 customer, a pharmacist or pharmacist's employee shall disclose the total
5 cost that a consumer would pay for pharmacist-provided hormonal
6 contraceptives. As used in this paragraph, "total cost" includes providing
7 the consumer with specific information regarding the price of the hormonal
8 contraceptive and the price of the administrative fee charged. This
9 limitation is not intended to interfere with other contractually agreed-upon
10 terms between a pharmacist or a pharmacist's employer or agent and a
11 health insurance plan or insurer. Patients who are insured or covered and
12 receive a pharmacy benefit that covers the cost of hormonal contraceptives
13 shall not be required to pay an administrative fee but may be required to pay
14 copayments pursuant to the terms and conditions of their coverage.
15 (6) All state and federal laws governing insurance coverage of contraceptive drugs,
16 devices, products, and services shall apply to hormonal contraceptives provided by
17 a pharmacist under this section.
18 (7) The board and the Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure shall ensure
19 compliance with this section, and each board is specifically charged with the
20 enforcement of this section with respect to its respective licensees.
21 (8) Any pharmacist or prescriber acting in good faith and with reasonable care
22 involved in the provision of hormonal contraceptives pursuant to this section
23 shall be immune from disciplinary or adverse administrative actions under this
24 chapter for acts or omissions related to the provision of a hormonal
25 contraceptive.
26 (9) A pharmacist or prescriber involved in the provision of hormonal contraceptives
27 pursuant to this section shall be immune from civil liability unless the injury

XXXX 9/13/2024 2:57 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 55
1 results from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the pharmacist or
2 provider.
3 (10) This section shall not apply to a valid patient-specific prescription for a hormonal
4 contraceptive issued by an authorized prescriber and dispensed by a pharmacist
5 pursuant to the valid prescription.
6 Section 11. Sections 2, 4, and 7 of this Act apply to health benefit plans issued,
7 renewed, amended, effective, or delivered on or after January 1, 2026.
8 Section 12. Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 of this Act take effect January 1, 2026.
9 Section 13. (1) For purposes of 45 C.F.R. sec. 156.115, the benefits required
10 under Section 2 of this Act are intended to be, and shall be considered, substantially equal
11 to the benefits required under the state's EHB-benchmark plan.
12 (2) For purposes of 45 C.F.R. sec. 155.170, the benefits required under Section 2
13 of this Act are intended to be, and shall be considered by the state as, a benefit required
14 by State action "for purposes of compliance with Federal requirements," and thus, the
15 state shall not consider or identify the benefits required under Section 2 of this Act as
16 being in addition to the essential health benefits required under federal law.
17 (3) The "Federal requirements" referred to in subsection (2) of this section
18 include the requirement to provide coverage for preventive health services under 42
19 U.S.C. sec. 300gg-13.
20 (4) The commissioner of insurance and any other state official or state agency
21 shall:
22 (a) Comply with the requirements of this section; and
23 (b) Not take any action that is in violation of or in conflict with this section.
24 Section 14. Notwithstanding KRS 194A.099:
25 (1) Within 90 days of the effective date of this section and subject to Section 13
26 of this Act, the Department of Insurance shall identify, in accordance with 45 C.F.R. sec.
27 155.170(a)(3), whether the application of any requirement of Section 2 of this Act to a
Page 30 of 31

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 55
1 qualified health plan (QHP) is in addition to the essential health benefits required under
2 federal law.
3 (2) If it is determined that the application of any requirement of Section 2 of this
4 Act to a QHP is in addition to the essential health benefits required under federal law,
5 then the department shall, within 180 days of the effective date of this section, apply for a
6 waiver under 42 U.S.C. sec. 18052, as amended, or any other applicable federal law of all
7 or any of the cost defrayal requirements under 42 U.S.C. sec. 18031(d)(3) and 45 C.F.R.
8 sec. 155.170, as amended.
9 (3) The application required under subsection (2) of this section:
10 (a) Shall comply with the requirements of federal law for obtaining a waiver; and
11 (b) May propose changes to the state's EHB-benchmark plan, as defined in 45
12 C.F.R. sec. 156.20, that are not in conflict with existing state law.
13 Section 15. If the Cabinet for Health and Family Services determines that a
14 waiver or any other authorization from a federal agency is necessary to implement any
15 provision of this Act for any reason, including the loss of federal funds, the Cabinet shall,
16 within 90 days after the effective date of this section, request the waiver or authorization,
17 and may only delay implementation of those provisions for which a waiver or
18 authorization was deemed necessary until the waiver or authorization is granted.
