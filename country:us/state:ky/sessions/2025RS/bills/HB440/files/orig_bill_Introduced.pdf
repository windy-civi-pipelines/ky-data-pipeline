1 nonresident children to be eligible to enroll in any public school located within the
2 district. The policy shall not discriminate against any pupil on the basis of
3 residential address, abilities, disability, race, ethnicity, sex, or socioeconomic
4 status[between nonresident pupils, but may recognize enrollment capacity, as
5 determined by the local school district]. The nonresident pupil policy and any
6 subsequent changes adopted by a board of education shall be filed with the
7 Kentucky Department of Education no later than thirty (30) days following their
8 adoption and posted on the district's website.

13 fee shall be paid by the board of education of the school district in which the pupil
14 resides, except in cases where the board makes provision for the child's education
15 within his or her district. If a board of education is required to pay a pupil's tuition
16 fee, the pupil shall be admitted to a school only upon proper certificate of the board

21 public school authorities of the other school district for that purpose, but before a
22 contract is entered into with public school authorities in another state the school
23 shall have been approved by the state school authorities of that state through the
24 grades in which the pupil belongs. When a district undertakes, under operation of a
25 tuition contract or of law, to provide in its school for pupils residing in another
26 district, the district of their residence shall share the total cost of the school,
27 including transportation when furnished at public expense, in proportion to the

4 enrollment capacity of each grade level at each school. The calculated capacities,
5 current enrollments, and available vacancies shall be posted on the district's

9 pupils.

14 nonresident pupil policy shall submit an enrollment application to the
15 school district on a form designated by the Kentucky Board of Education.
16 The application shall indicate the child's grade level and which of the
17 district's schools is desired;
18 (b) Within ten (10) days of submission, the board of education shall review and
19 act upon the application. The board shall approve the application if there is
20 capacity at the requested school at the child's grade level; and
21 (c) Within five (5) days of the board's action on the application, the board shall
22 notify the parent or guardian of the action. If the board denies the
23 application, the parent or guardian may appeal the local board's decision to
24 the Kentucky Board of Education within ten (10) days of the receipt of the

17 initial term commencing with the date of the lease and ending with the next
18 ensuing June 30, which is the close of the then-current fiscal biennium of the
19 Commonwealth, with exclusive options in favor of the board to renew the
20 same for successive ensuing bienniums, July 1 in each even year to June 30 in
21 the next ensuing even year; and the rentals may be fixed at the sums in each
22 biennium, if renewed, sufficient to enable the State Property and Buildings
23 Commission to pay therefrom the maturing principal of and interest on, and
24 provide reserves for, any revenue bonds which the State Property and

1 issuance of the bonds.
2 (b) Each option of the Kentucky Board of Education to renew the lease for a

14 immediately preceding the beginning of the succeeding biennium.
15 (c) The Kentucky Board of Education shall not itself operate leased television
16 facilities, or undertake the preparation of the educational presentations or
17 films to be transmitted thereby, but may enter into one (1) or more contracts
18 to provide therefor, with any public agency and instrumentality of the

5 Property and Buildings Commission shall bind the board to pay rentals for
6 more than one (1) fiscal biennium at a time, subject to the aforesaid renewal
7 options. The board may receive and may apply to rental payments under any
8 lease and to the cost of providing for the operation of the television or related
9 facilities not only appropriations which may be made to it from state funds,
10 from time to time, but also contributions, gifts, matching funds, devises, and
11 bequests from any source, whether federal or state, and whether public or
12 private, so long as the same are not conditioned upon any improper use of the
13 television or related facilities in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of
14 this subsection.
15 (4) The state board may, on the recommendation and with the advice of the chief state
16 school officer, prescribe, print, publish, and distribute at public expense such
17 administrative regulations, courses of study, curriculums, bulletins, programs,
18 outlines, reports, and placards as each deems necessary for the efficient
19 management, control, and operation of the schools and programs under its
