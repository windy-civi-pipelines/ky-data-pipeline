6 include limitations upon the number of days a teacher or employee may annually
7 contribute to the bank and limitations upon the number of days a teacher or
8 employee may annually draw from the bank. Only those teachers or employees who
9 contribute to the bank may draw upon the bank. Days contributed will be deducted
10 from the days available to the contributing teacher or employee. The sick leave
11 bank shall be administered in accordance with a policy adopted by the board of
12 education.
13 (8) (a) A district board of education shall establish a sick leave donation program to
14 permit teachers or employees to voluntarily contribute sick leave to teachers

17 fifteen (15) days' sick leave may request the board of education to transfer a
18 designated amount of sick leave to another teacher or employee who is

20 request an amount of sick leave be donated that reduces his or her sick leave
21 balance to less than fifteen (15) days.

23 1. a. The teacher or employee or a member of his or her immediate
24 family suffers from a medically certified illness, injury,

20 implement the sick leave donation program.
21 (9) A teacher or employee may use up to thirty (30) days of sick leave following the

2 day shall be based on a percentage of the daily salary rate calculated from the
3 employee's or teacher's last annual salary, not to exceed thirty percent (30%).
4 (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this subsection, payment for unused
5 sick leave days under this subsection shall be incorporated into the annual
6 salary of the final year of service for inclusion in the calculation of the
7 employee's or teacher's retirement allowance only at the time of his or her
8 initial retirement, provided that the member makes the regular retirement
9 contribution for members on the sick leave payment. The accumulation of
10 these days includes unused sick leave days held by the employee or teacher at
11 the time of implementation of the program.
12 (c) For a teacher or employee who becomes a nonuniversity member of the
13 Teachers' Retirement System on or after January 1, 2022, as provided by KRS

14 property at school-sponsored activities, constitutes cause for suspension or
15 expulsion from school; and
16 (b) Assault[ or battery or abuse] of school personnel; stealing or willfully or
17 wantonly defacing, destroying, or damaging the personal property of school
18 personnel on school property, off school property, or at school-sponsored

Page 8 of 18
XXXX 2/16/2025 12:46 PM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 468
1 weapon to school, a local board of education shall use the definition of
2 "unlawful possession of a weapon on school property" stated in KRS
3 527.070;
4 3. To have physically assaulted educational personnel at a school or
5 school function under the board's jurisdiction; or

7 property and the incident is likely to substantially disrupt the
8 educational process.

10 including expulsion from school, for a student who is determined by the board
11 to have:
12 1. Possessed prescription drugs or controlled substances for the purpose of
13 sale or distribution at a school under the board's jurisdiction;
14 2. Physically assaulted[ or battered or abused educational personnel or]

20 (3) (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, the board may
21 modify the expulsion requirement and length for students on a case-by-case
22 basis, except the length of expulsion shall be at least twelve (12) months for a
23 violation set forth in subsection (2)(a) of this section.
24 (b) In the case of students who have violated subsection (2)(a)3. or 4. of this

26 unless the victim of the assault consents to the modification. The victim may
27 issue conditional consent, the terms of which, if ratified by the board by
Page 9 of 18
XXXX 2/16/2025 12:46 PM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 468
1 virtue of issuing a modification, shall be honored until the student ceases to
2 be enrolled in the school or the victim ceases to be employed at the school,
3 whichever occurs first. A school district shall not retaliate against a victim,
4 coerce a victim to consent to a modification, or otherwise exercise undue
5 influence over the terms of that consent.
6 (c)[(b)] Nothing in this section shall prohibit a board from expelling a student
7 for longer than twelve (12) months.
8 (d)[(c)] A board that has expelled a student from the student's regular school
9 setting shall provide or ensure that educational services are provided to the
10 student in an appropriate alternative program or setting, unless the board has
11 made a determination, on the record, supported by clear and convincing
12 evidence, that the expelled student posed a threat to the safety of other
13 students or school staff and could not be placed into a state-funded agency
14 program. Behavior which constitutes a threat shall include but not be limited
15 to the physical assault[, battery, or abuse] of others; the threat of physical
16 force; being under the influence of drugs or alcohol; the use, possession, sale,
17 or transfer of drugs or alcohol; the carrying, possessing, or transfer of
18 weapons or dangerous instruments; and any other behavior which may
19 endanger the safety of others. Other intervention services as indicated for each
20 student may be provided by the board or by agreement with the appropriate
21 state or community agency. A state agency that provides the service shall be
22 responsible for the cost.
23 (e)[(d)] 1. In lieu of expelling a student, or upon the expiration of a student's
24 expulsion, a superintendent may place a student into an alternative
25 program or setting if the superintendent determines placement of the
26 student in his or her regular school setting is likely to substantially
27 disrupt the education process or constitutes a threat to the safety of other
Page 10 of 18
XXXX 2/16/2025 12:46 PM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 468
1 students or school staff. The action shall not be taken until the parent,
2 guardian, or other person having legal custody or control of the student
3 has had an opportunity to have a hearing before the board or an appeals
4 committee as described in subparagraph 2. of this paragraph.
5 2. The board may adopt a policy to establish an appeals committee and
6 delegate the authority to hear appeals made under this paragraph to that
7 committee.
8 3. The alternative program or setting may be provided virtually.

13 alternative programs of the district.
14 5. Students placed in an alternative program or setting under this paragraph
15 shall be subject to compulsory attendance requirements under KRS
16 Chapter 159 and applicable local board policy.
17 6. Following the initial alternative placement of a student under this
18 paragraph, the board shall review the alternative program or setting
19 placement at least once per year and determine if the placement should
20 be continued in accordance with subparagraph 1. of this paragraph.
21 (4) For purposes of this subsection, "charges" means substantiated behavior that falls
22 within the grounds for suspension or expulsion enumerated in subsection (1) of this
23 section, including behavior committed by a student while enrolled in a private or
24 public school, or in a school within another state. A school board may adopt a
25 policy providing that, if a student is suspended or expelled for any reason or faces
26 charges that may lead to suspension or expulsion but withdraws prior to a hearing
27 from any public or private school in this or any other state, the receiving district
Page 11 of 18

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 468
1 may review the details of the charges, suspension, or expulsion and determine if the
2 student will be admitted, and if so, what conditions may be imposed upon the
3 admission, which may include placement of the student into an alternative program
4 or setting as described in subsection (3)(e)[(d)] of this section.
5 (5) (a) School administrators, teachers, or other school personnel may immediately
6 remove or cause to be removed threatening or violent students from a
7 classroom setting or from the district transportation system pending any
8 further disciplinary action that may occur. Each board of education shall adopt
9 a policy to assure the implementation of this section and to assure the safety
10 of the students and staff.
11 (b) Except as described in subsection (10) of this section:
12 1. A principal may establish procedures for a student's removal from and
13 reentry to the classroom when the student's behavior disrupts the
14 classroom environment and education process or the student challenges
15 the authority of a supervising adult. In addition to removal, the student
16 shall be subject to further discipline for the behavior consistent with the
17 school's code of conduct.
18 2. A student who is removed from the same classroom three (3) times
19 within a thirty (30) day period shall be considered chronically disruptive
20 and may be suspended from school in accordance with this section, and
21 no other basis for suspension shall be deemed necessary.
22 3. At any time during the school year, for a student who has been removed
23 from the classroom under this paragraph, a principal may require a
24 review of the classroom issues with the teacher and the parent, guardian,
25 or other person having legal custody or control of the student and
26 determine a course of action for the teacher and student regarding the
27 student's continued placement in the classroom.

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 468
1 4. At any time during the school year, a principal may permanently remove
2 a student from a classroom for the remainder of the school year if the
3 principal determines the student's continued placement in the classroom
4 will chronically disrupt the education process for other students.
5 5. When a student is removed from a classroom under this paragraph
6 temporarily or permanently, the principal shall determine the placement
7 of the student in lieu of that classroom, which may include but is not
8 limited to:
9 a. Another classroom in that school; or
10 b. An alternative program or setting, which may be provided
11 virtually, as approved by the superintendent.
12 6. Any permanent action by a principal under this paragraph shall be
13 subject to an appeal process in accordance with a policy adopted by the
14 board.
15 7. Policies compliant with this paragraph shall be included in the code of
16 behavior and discipline adopted by the board of education under KRS
17 158.148 and the policies adopted by the school council under KRS
18 160.345.
19 (6) A student shall not be suspended from the common schools until after at least the
20 following due process procedures have been provided:
21 (a) The student has been given oral or written notice of the charge or charges
22 against him or her which constitute cause for suspension;
23 (b) The student has been given an explanation of the evidence of the charge or
24 charges if the student denies them; and
25 (c) The student has been given an opportunity to present his or her own version of
26 the facts relating to the charge or charges.
27 These due process procedures shall precede any suspension from the common
Page 13 of 18
XXXX 2/16/2025 12:46 PM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 468
1 schools unless immediate suspension is essential to protect persons or property or to
2 avoid disruption of the ongoing academic process. In such cases, the due process
3 procedures outlined above shall follow the suspension as soon as practicable, but no
4 later than three (3) school days after the suspension.
5 (7) (a) The superintendent, principal, assistant principal, or head teacher of any
6 school may suspend a student but shall report the action in writing
7 immediately to the superintendent and to the parent, guardian, or other person
8 having legal custody or control of the student.
9 (b) 1. The board of education of any school district may expel or extend the
10 expulsion of any student for misconduct as described in subsection (1)
11 of this section, but the action shall not be taken until the parent,
12 guardian, or other person having legal custody or control of the student
13 has had an opportunity to have a hearing before the board. The decision
14 of the board shall be final.
15 2. Within thirty (30) days prior to the end of a student's expulsion, the
16 board shall review the details of the expulsion and current factors and
17 circumstances, including if ending the expulsion will substantially
18 disrupt the education process or constitute a threat to the safety of
19 students or school staff, to determine if the expulsion shall be extended
20 for a period not to exceed twelve (12) months.
21 3. The expulsion review process shall be used prior to the end of each
22 expulsion period until the board ends the expulsion or the student is no
23 longer subject to compulsory attendance under KRS 159.010.
24 4. Each board of education shall adopt a policy for implementation of the
25 process described in this paragraph.
26 (8) (a) Suspension of exceptional children, as defined in KRS 157.200, shall be
27 considered a change of educational placement if:
Page 14 of 18
XXXX 2/16/2025 12:46 PM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 468
1 1. The child is removed for more than ten (10) consecutive days during a
2 school year; or
3 2. The child is subjected to a series of removals that constitute a pattern
4 because the removals accumulate to more than ten (10) school days
5 during a school year and because of other factors, such as the length of
6 each removal, the total amount of time the child is removed, and the
7 proximity of removals to one another.
8 (b) The admissions and release committee shall meet to review the placement and
9 make a recommendation for continued placement or a change in placement
10 and determine whether regular suspension or expulsion procedures apply.
11 Additional evaluations shall be completed, if necessary.
12 (c) If the admissions and release committee determines that an exceptional child's
13 behavior is related to his or her disability, the child shall not be suspended any
14 further or expelled unless the current placement could result in injury to the
15 child, other children, or the educational personnel, in which case an
16 appropriate alternative placement shall be provided that will provide for the
17 child's educational needs and will provide a safe learning and teaching
18 environment for all. If the admissions and release committee determines that
19 the behavior is not related to the disability, the local educational agency may
20 pursue its regular suspension or expulsion procedure for the child, if the
21 behavior so warrants. However, educational services shall not be terminated
22 during a period of expulsion and during a suspension after a student is

5 physician or surgeon duly qualified under KRS Chapter 342], whichever
6 is sooner;
7 2.[(b)] The district shall pay, for the entire duration of leave[up to one

10 benefits received by the teacher or employee resulting from the assault.
11 Payments by the district shall include payments for intermittent work
12 time missed as a result of the assault during the leave[one (1) year]
13 period.[ If the teacher's or employee's workers' compensation income
14 benefits cease during the one (1) year period after the assault, the district
15 shall also cease to make payments under this paragraph];
16 3.[(c)] The Commonwealth, through the Kentucky Department of

6 include limitations upon the number of days a teacher or employee may annually
7 contribute to the bank and limitations upon the number of days a teacher or
8 employee may annually draw from the bank. Only those teachers or employees who
9 contribute to the bank may draw upon the bank. Days contributed will be deducted
10 from the days available to the contributing teacher or employee. The sick leave
11 bank shall be administered in accordance with a policy adopted by the board of
12 education.
13 (8) (a) A district board of education shall establish a sick leave donation program to
14 permit teachers or employees to voluntarily contribute sick leave to teachers
15 or employees in the same school district who are in need of an extended
16 absence from school. A teacher or employee who has accrued more than
17 fifteen (15) days' sick leave may request the board of education to transfer a
18 designated amount of sick leave to another teacher or employee who is
19 authorized to receive the sick leave donated. A teacher or employee may not
20 request an amount of sick leave be donated that reduces his or her sick leave
21 balance to less than fifteen (15) days.

23 1. a. The teacher or employee or a member of his or her immediate
24 family suffers from a medically certified illness, injury,
25 impairment, or physical or mental condition that has caused or is
26 likely to cause the teacher or employee to be absent for at least ten
27 (10) days; or

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 468
1 b. The teacher or employee suffers from a catastrophic loss to his or
2 her personal or real property, due to either a natural disaster or fire,

4 absent for at least ten (10) consecutive working days;
5 2. The teacher's or employee's need for the absence and use of leave are
6 certified by a licensed physician for leave requested under subparagraph
7 1.a. of this subsection;
8 3. The teacher or employee has exhausted his or her accumulated sick
9 leave, personal leave, and any other leave granted by the school district;
10 and
11 4. The teacher or employee has complied with the school district's policies
12 governing the use of sick leave.
13 (c) While a teacher or employee is on sick leave provided by this section, he or
14 she shall be considered a school district employee, and his or her salary,
15 wages, and other employee benefits shall not be affected.
16 (d) Any sick leave that remains unused, is not needed by a teacher or employee,
17 and will not be needed in the future shall be returned to the teacher or
18 employee donating the sick leave.
19 (e) The board of education shall adopt policies and procedures necessary to
20 implement the sick leave donation program.

25 time of retirement or upon the death of a member in active contributing status
26 at the time of death who was eligible to retire by reason of service, an
27 employee or a teacher, or the estate of an employee or teacher, for each

1 unused sick leave day. The rate of compensation for each unused sick leave
2 day shall be based on a percentage of the daily salary rate calculated from the
3 employee's or teacher's last annual salary, not to exceed thirty percent (30%).
4 (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this subsection, payment for unused
5 sick leave days under this subsection shall be incorporated into the annual
6 salary of the final year of service for inclusion in the calculation of the
7 employee's or teacher's retirement allowance only at the time of his or her
8 initial retirement, provided that the member makes the regular retirement
9 contribution for members on the sick leave payment. The accumulation of
10 these days includes unused sick leave days held by the employee or teacher at
11 the time of implementation of the program.
12 (c) For a teacher or employee who becomes a nonuniversity member of the
13 Teachers' Retirement System on or after January 1, 2022, as provided by KRS

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 468
1 weapon to school, a local board of education shall use the definition of
2 "unlawful possession of a weapon on school property" stated in KRS
3 527.070;
4 3. To have physically assaulted educational personnel at a school or
5 school function under the board's jurisdiction; or
6 4. To have physically assaulted educational personnel off school
7 property and the incident is likely to substantially disrupt the
8 educational process.
9 (b) The board shall also adopt a policy requiring disciplinary actions, up to and
10 including expulsion from school, for a student who is determined by the board
11 to have:
12 1. Possessed prescription drugs or controlled substances for the purpose of
13 sale or distribution at a school under the board's jurisdiction;
14 2. Physically assaulted[ or battered or abused educational personnel or]
15 other students at a school or school function under the board's
16 jurisdiction; or
17 3. Physically assaulted[, battered, or abused educational personnel or]

19 substantially disrupt the educational process.
20 (3) (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, the board may
21 modify the expulsion requirement and length for students on a case-by-case
22 basis, except the length of expulsion shall be at least twelve (12) months for a
23 violation set forth in subsection (2)(a) of this section.
24 (b) In the case of students who have violated subsection (2)(a)3. or 4. of this
25 section, the board shall not modify the expulsion requirement or length
26 unless the victim of the assault consents to the modification. The victim may
27 issue conditional consent, the terms of which, if ratified by the board by
Page 9 of 18

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 468
1 virtue of issuing a modification, shall be honored until the student ceases to
2 be enrolled in the school or the victim ceases to be employed at the school,
3 whichever occurs first. A school district shall not retaliate against a victim,
4 coerce a victim to consent to a modification, or otherwise exercise undue
5 influence over the terms of that consent.
6 (c)[(b)] Nothing in this section shall prohibit a board from expelling a student
7 for longer than twelve (12) months.
8 (d)[(c)] A board that has expelled a student from the student's regular school
9 setting shall provide or ensure that educational services are provided to the
10 student in an appropriate alternative program or setting, unless the board has
11 made a determination, on the record, supported by clear and convincing
12 evidence, that the expelled student posed a threat to the safety of other
13 students or school staff and could not be placed into a state-funded agency
14 program. Behavior which constitutes a threat shall include but not be limited
15 to the physical assault[, battery, or abuse] of others; the threat of physical
16 force; being under the influence of drugs or alcohol; the use, possession, sale,
17 or transfer of drugs or alcohol; the carrying, possessing, or transfer of
18 weapons or dangerous instruments; and any other behavior which may
19 endanger the safety of others. Other intervention services as indicated for each
20 student may be provided by the board or by agreement with the appropriate
21 state or community agency. A state agency that provides the service shall be
22 responsible for the cost.
23 (e)[(d)] 1. In lieu of expelling a student, or upon the expiration of a student's
24 expulsion, a superintendent may place a student into an alternative
25 program or setting if the superintendent determines placement of the
26 student in his or her regular school setting is likely to substantially
27 disrupt the education process or constitutes a threat to the safety of other
Page 10 of 18

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 468
1 students or school staff. The action shall not be taken until the parent,
2 guardian, or other person having legal custody or control of the student
3 has had an opportunity to have a hearing before the board or an appeals
4 committee as described in subparagraph 2. of this paragraph.
5 2. The board may adopt a policy to establish an appeals committee and
6 delegate the authority to hear appeals made under this paragraph to that
7 committee.
8 3. The alternative program or setting may be provided virtually.
9 4. Notwithstanding any other statute or administrative regulation to the
10 contrary, students placed in an alternative program or setting under this
11 paragraph shall be counted in attendance and membership for state
12 funding purposes in the same manner as other students participating in
13 alternative programs of the district.
14 5. Students placed in an alternative program or setting under this paragraph
15 shall be subject to compulsory attendance requirements under KRS
16 Chapter 159 and applicable local board policy.
17 6. Following the initial alternative placement of a student under this
18 paragraph, the board shall review the alternative program or setting
19 placement at least once per year and determine if the placement should
20 be continued in accordance with subparagraph 1. of this paragraph.
21 (4) For purposes of this subsection, "charges" means substantiated behavior that falls
22 within the grounds for suspension or expulsion enumerated in subsection (1) of this
23 section, including behavior committed by a student while enrolled in a private or
24 public school, or in a school within another state. A school board may adopt a
25 policy providing that, if a student is suspended or expelled for any reason or faces
26 charges that may lead to suspension or expulsion but withdraws prior to a hearing
27 from any public or private school in this or any other state, the receiving district

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 468
1 may review the details of the charges, suspension, or expulsion and determine if the
2 student will be admitted, and if so, what conditions may be imposed upon the
3 admission, which may include placement of the student into an alternative program
4 or setting as described in subsection (3)(e)[(d)] of this section.
5 (5) (a) School administrators, teachers, or other school personnel may immediately
6 remove or cause to be removed threatening or violent students from a
7 classroom setting or from the district transportation system pending any
8 further disciplinary action that may occur. Each board of education shall adopt
9 a policy to assure the implementation of this section and to assure the safety
10 of the students and staff.
11 (b) Except as described in subsection (10) of this section:
12 1. A principal may establish procedures for a student's removal from and
13 reentry to the classroom when the student's behavior disrupts the
14 classroom environment and education process or the student challenges
15 the authority of a supervising adult. In addition to removal, the student
16 shall be subject to further discipline for the behavior consistent with the
17 school's code of conduct.
18 2. A student who is removed from the same classroom three (3) times
19 within a thirty (30) day period shall be considered chronically disruptive
20 and may be suspended from school in accordance with this section, and
21 no other basis for suspension shall be deemed necessary.
22 3. At any time during the school year, for a student who has been removed
23 from the classroom under this paragraph, a principal may require a
24 review of the classroom issues with the teacher and the parent, guardian,
25 or other person having legal custody or control of the student and
26 determine a course of action for the teacher and student regarding the
27 student's continued placement in the classroom.
Page 12 of 18

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 468
1 4. At any time during the school year, a principal may permanently remove
2 a student from a classroom for the remainder of the school year if the
3 principal determines the student's continued placement in the classroom
4 will chronically disrupt the education process for other students.
5 5. When a student is removed from a classroom under this paragraph
6 temporarily or permanently, the principal shall determine the placement
7 of the student in lieu of that classroom, which may include but is not
8 limited to:
9 a. Another classroom in that school; or
10 b. An alternative program or setting, which may be provided
11 virtually, as approved by the superintendent.
12 6. Any permanent action by a principal under this paragraph shall be
13 subject to an appeal process in accordance with a policy adopted by the
14 board.
15 7. Policies compliant with this paragraph shall be included in the code of
16 behavior and discipline adopted by the board of education under KRS
17 158.148 and the policies adopted by the school council under KRS
18 160.345.
19 (6) A student shall not be suspended from the common schools until after at least the
20 following due process procedures have been provided:
21 (a) The student has been given oral or written notice of the charge or charges
22 against him or her which constitute cause for suspension;
23 (b) The student has been given an explanation of the evidence of the charge or
24 charges if the student denies them; and
25 (c) The student has been given an opportunity to present his or her own version of
26 the facts relating to the charge or charges.
27 These due process procedures shall precede any suspension from the common
Page 13 of 18
XXXX 2/16/2025 12:46 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 468
1 schools unless immediate suspension is essential to protect persons or property or to
2 avoid disruption of the ongoing academic process. In such cases, the due process
3 procedures outlined above shall follow the suspension as soon as practicable, but no
4 later than three (3) school days after the suspension.
5 (7) (a) The superintendent, principal, assistant principal, or head teacher of any
6 school may suspend a student but shall report the action in writing
7 immediately to the superintendent and to the parent, guardian, or other person
8 having legal custody or control of the student.
9 (b) 1. The board of education of any school district may expel or extend the
10 expulsion of any student for misconduct as described in subsection (1)
11 of this section, but the action shall not be taken until the parent,
12 guardian, or other person having legal custody or control of the student
13 has had an opportunity to have a hearing before the board. The decision
14 of the board shall be final.
15 2. Within thirty (30) days prior to the end of a student's expulsion, the
16 board shall review the details of the expulsion and current factors and
17 circumstances, including if ending the expulsion will substantially
18 disrupt the education process or constitute a threat to the safety of
19 students or school staff, to determine if the expulsion shall be extended
20 for a period not to exceed twelve (12) months.
21 3. The expulsion review process shall be used prior to the end of each
22 expulsion period until the board ends the expulsion or the student is no
23 longer subject to compulsory attendance under KRS 159.010.
24 4. Each board of education shall adopt a policy for implementation of the
25 process described in this paragraph.
26 (8) (a) Suspension of exceptional children, as defined in KRS 157.200, shall be
27 considered a change of educational placement if:
Page 14 of 18
XXXX 2/16/2025 12:46 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 468
1 1. The child is removed for more than ten (10) consecutive days during a
2 school year; or
3 2. The child is subjected to a series of removals that constitute a pattern
4 because the removals accumulate to more than ten (10) school days
5 during a school year and because of other factors, such as the length of
6 each removal, the total amount of time the child is removed, and the
7 proximity of removals to one another.
8 (b) The admissions and release committee shall meet to review the placement and
9 make a recommendation for continued placement or a change in placement
10 and determine whether regular suspension or expulsion procedures apply.
11 Additional evaluations shall be completed, if necessary.
12 (c) If the admissions and release committee determines that an exceptional child's
13 behavior is related to his or her disability, the child shall not be suspended any
14 further or expelled unless the current placement could result in injury to the
15 child, other children, or the educational personnel, in which case an
16 appropriate alternative placement shall be provided that will provide for the
17 child's educational needs and will provide a safe learning and teaching
18 environment for all. If the admissions and release committee determines that
19 the behavior is not related to the disability, the local educational agency may
20 pursue its regular suspension or expulsion procedure for the child, if the
21 behavior so warrants. However, educational services shall not be terminated
22 during a period of expulsion and during a suspension after a student is
23 suspended for more than a total of ten (10) days during a school year. A
24 district may seek temporary injunctive relief through the courts if the parent
25 and the other members of the admissions and release committee cannot agree
26 upon a placement and the current placement will likely result in injury to the
27 student or others.

3 others.
4 (10) Any action under this section related to students with disabilities shall be in
5 compliance with applicable federal law.

21 has been terminated and shall reflect the charges and any final disposition of the
22 expulsion proceedings.
23 (7) Neither the husband-wife privilege of KRE 504 nor any professional-client
24 privilege, including those set forth in KRE 506 and 507, shall be a ground for
25 refusing to make a report required under this section or for excluding evidence in a
