10 carry a concealed deadly weapon in their state based upon having a valid
11 Kentucky concealed deadly weapon license, or whether a Kentucky resident
12 may apply for a concealed deadly weapon carrying license in that state based

15 months without payment, or fail, after receiving appropriate notice, to comply with
16 subpoenas or warrants relating to paternity or child support proceedings as provided

13 willingness to consent to a support order.
14 (6) When in the best interest of the child, the Office of the Attorney General may
15 review and adjust a parent's child support obligation or child care obligation as
16 established by the office, upon a request of the office when an assignment has been

18 under the order differs from the amount that would be awarded in accordance with
19 KRS 403.212 or 403.2122. The Office of the Attorney General shall notify parents
20 at least once every three (3) years of the right to a review.
21 (7) In establishing or modifying a parent's monthly child support obligation, the Office
22 of the Attorney General may use automated methods to identify orders eligible for

16 (b) Upon receipt of a request for informal dispute resolution, the regional
17 program manager, or the manager's designee, and a child-caring surveyor who
18 did not participate in the original survey or the decision to issue the disputed
19 deficiency shall, within thirty (30) days of receipt of the request, review the
20 specific deficiencies in dispute and notify the applicant or licensee in writing

22 applicant or licensee, the meeting shall be held, and no decision shall be made
23 regarding the disputed deficiencies until after the face-to-face meeting has
24 occurred.
25 1. If materials submitted by the applicant or licensee by mail or at the face-

5 findings of the regional office staff and make any corrections required
6 by the cabinet, or may, within thirty (30) days of receipt of the notice,
7 request in writing a meeting with the secretary or the secretary's
8 designee. The secretary may designate an individual who holds the
9 position of director or above to serve as the designee.
10 3. The secretary or the secretary's designee shall meet in person with the
11 licensee or applicant and review the documentation available within
12 fifteen (15) days of receipt of the request.
13 4. If the information provided demonstrates that specific deficiencies
14 should not have been cited, those deficiencies will be removed from the
15 statement of deficiencies and any enforcement actions imposed solely as
16 a result of those cited deficiencies will be rescinded.
17 5. If the secretary or the secretary's designee affirms the deficiencies, the
18 secretary or the secretary's designee shall, within fifteen (15) days issue
19 a final written order stating the cabinet's final position regarding the
20 deficiencies in dispute. The decision of the secretary or the secretary's
21 designee shall be a final order for purposes of subsection (5) of this
22 section.
23 (c) A request for informal dispute resolution shall not delay the required
24 submission of a plan of correction for any deficiency not in dispute. Any
25 corrective plan of action or similar submission required by the cabinet relating
26 to any deficiency in dispute shall be suspended until a decision is rendered
27 and a corrective plan of action is agreed to within the informal dispute

10 carry a concealed deadly weapon in their state based upon having a valid
11 Kentucky concealed deadly weapon license, or whether a Kentucky resident
12 may apply for a concealed deadly weapon carrying license in that state based
13 upon having a valid Kentucky concealed deadly weapon license. The

15 review and adjust a parent's child support obligation or child care obligation as

20 at least once every three (3) years of the right to a review.
21 (7) In establishing or modifying a parent's monthly child support obligation, the Office
22 of the Attorney General may use automated methods to identify orders eligible for

6 of the hearing, and all testimony shall be recorded but not be transcribed unless the
7 cabinet's final decision is appealed pursuant to this chapter.

9 final decision is made, no person shall have ex parte contacts with employees of the
10 cabinet regarding the revocation. If an ex parte contact occurs, it shall be promptly

6 Section 31. KRS 199.670 is amended to read as follows:
7 (1) The cabinet may revoke or suspend a license issued under KRS 199.640 for any

11 regulation promulgated in accordance with the provisions of KRS 199.640.
12 (2) If the cabinet proposes to revoke or suspend, or to refuse to issue a license, written
13 notice shall be given to the licensee or applicant, stating the proposed action and
14 grounds for the action[therefor], and notifying the licensee or applicant that the

2 (4) (a) Upon receipt of a statement of deficiency from the cabinet, the applicant or

5 written request to the cabinet for informal dispute resolution, which must be

8 1. Specify the deficiencies in dispute;
9 2. Provide a detailed explanation of the basis for the dispute;
10 3. Include any supporting documentation, including any information that
11 was not available at the time of the survey; and
12 4. If desired, request a face-to-face meeting with the regional program

14 participate in the original survey or the decision to issue the disputed
15 deficiency.
16 (b) Upon receipt of a request for informal dispute resolution, the regional
17 program manager, or the manager's designee, and a child-caring surveyor who
18 did not participate in the original survey or the decision to issue the disputed

20 specific deficiencies in dispute and notify the applicant or licensee in writing

24 occurred.
25 1. If materials submitted by the applicant or licensee by mail or at the face-
26 to-face meeting demonstrate that specific deficiencies should not have
27 been cited, those deficiencies will be removed from the statement of

1 deficiencies and any enforcement actions imposed solely as a result of
2 those cited deficiencies will be rescinded.
3 2. If, after review of the disputed deficiencies, the regional office staff
4 affirms the deficiencies, the licensee or applicant may accept the
5 findings of the regional office staff and make any corrections required
6 by the cabinet, or may, within thirty (30) days of receipt of the notice,
7 request in writing a meeting with the secretary or the secretary's
8 designee. The secretary may designate an individual who holds the
9 position of director or above to serve as the designee.
10 3. The secretary or the secretary's designee shall meet in person with the
11 licensee or applicant and review the documentation available within
12 fifteen (15) days of receipt of the request.
13 4. If the information provided demonstrates that specific deficiencies
14 should not have been cited, those deficiencies will be removed from the
15 statement of deficiencies and any enforcement actions imposed solely as
16 a result of those cited deficiencies will be rescinded.
17 5. If the secretary or the secretary's designee affirms the deficiencies, the
18 secretary or the secretary's designee shall, within fifteen (15) days issue
19 a final written order stating the cabinet's final position regarding the
20 deficiencies in dispute. The decision of the secretary or the secretary's
21 designee shall be a final order for purposes of subsection (5) of this
22 section.
23 (c) A request for informal dispute resolution shall not delay the required
24 submission of a plan of correction for any deficiency not in dispute. Any
25 corrective plan of action or similar submission required by the cabinet relating
26 to any deficiency in dispute shall be suspended until a decision is rendered
27 and a corrective plan of action is agreed to within the informal dispute
