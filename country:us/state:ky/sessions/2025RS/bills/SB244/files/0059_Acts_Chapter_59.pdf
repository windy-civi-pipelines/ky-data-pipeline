order, in writing and by return of the license, upon proper motion by the license holder. Subject to the
same conditions as above, a peace officer against whom an emergency protective order or domestic
violence order has been issued shall not be permitted to carry a concealed deadly weapon when not on
duty, the provisions of KRS 527.020 to the contrary notwithstanding.

records check as specified in subsection (3) of this section, determination that the renewal applicant is
not ineligible for a license as specified in subsection (4), and appropriate payment of fees. Upon the
issuance of a new license, the old license shall be destroyed by the sheriff. A licensee who fails to file a
renewal application on or before its expiration date may renew his or her license by paying, in addition
to the license fees, a late fee of fifteen dollars ($15). No license shall be renewed six (6) months or more
after its expiration date, and the license shall be deemed to be permanently expired six (6) months after
its expiration date. A person whose license has permanently expired may reapply for licensure pursuant
to subsections (7), (8), and (9) of this section.
(15) The licensee shall carry the license at all times the licensee is carrying a concealed firearm or other deadly
weapon and shall display the license upon request of a law enforcement officer. Violation of the provisions of
this subsection shall constitute a noncriminal violation with a penalty of twenty-five dollars ($25), payable to
the clerk of the District Court, but no court costs shall be assessed.

(19) The General Assembly finds as a matter of public policy that it is necessary to provide statewide uniform
standards for issuing licenses to carry concealed firearms and to occupy the field of regulation of the bearing
of concealed firearms to ensure that no person who qualifies under the provisions of this section is denied his
rights. The General Assembly does not delegate to the Department of Kentucky State Police the authority to
regulate or restrict the issuing of licenses provided for in this section beyond those provisions contained in this
section. This section shall be liberally construed to carry out the constitutional right to bear arms for self-
defense.
(20) (a) A person who is not a resident of Kentucky and who has a valid license issued by another state of the
United States to carry a concealed deadly weapon in that state may, subject to provisions of Kentucky
law, carry a concealed deadly weapon in Kentucky, and his or her license shall be considered as valid in
Kentucky.
(b) If a person with a valid license to carry a concealed deadly weapon issued from another state that has
entered into a reciprocity agreement with the Department of Kentucky State Police becomes a resident
of Kentucky, the license issued by the other state shall be considered as valid for the first one hundred

CHAPTER 59 17
twenty (120) days of the person's residence in Kentucky, if within sixty (60) days of moving to
Kentucky, the person completes a form promulgated by the Department of Kentucky State Police which
shall include:
1. A signed and notarized statement averring that to the best of his or her knowledge the person's
license to carry a concealed deadly weapon is valid and in compliance with applicable out-of-
state law, and has not been revoked or suspended for any reason except for valid forfeiture due to
departure from the issuing state;
2. The person's name, date of birth, citizenship, gender, Social Security number if applicable, proof
that he or she is a citizen of the United States, a permanent resident of the United States, or
otherwise lawfully present in the United States, former out-of-state address, current address

(e) The Department of Kentucky State Police shall,[ not later than thirty (30) days after July 15, 1998, and]
not less than once every twelve (12) months[ thereafter], make written inquiry of the concealed deadly
weapon carrying licensing authorities in each other state as to whether a Kentucky resident may carry a
concealed deadly weapon in their state based upon having a valid Kentucky concealed deadly weapon
license, or whether a Kentucky resident may apply for a concealed deadly weapon carrying license in
that state based upon having a valid Kentucky concealed deadly weapon license. The Department of
Kentucky State Police shall attempt to secure from each other state permission for Kentucky residents
who hold a valid Kentucky concealed deadly weapon license to carry concealed deadly weapons in that
state, either on the basis of the Kentucky license or on the basis that the Kentucky license is sufficient to
permit the issuance of a similar license by the other state. The Department of Kentucky State Police
shall enter into a written reciprocity agreement with the appropriate agency in each state that agrees to
permit Kentucky residents to carry concealed deadly weapons in the other state on the basis of a
Kentucky-issued concealed deadly weapon license or that will issue a license to carry concealed deadly
weapons in the other state based upon a Kentucky concealed deadly weapon license. If a reciprocity
agreement is reached, the requirement to recontact the other state each twelve (12) months shall be
eliminated as long as the reciprocity agreement is in force. The information shall be a public record and
shall be available to individual requesters free of charge for the first copy and at the normal rate for
open records requests for additional copies.
(21) By March 1 of each year, the Department of Kentucky State Police shall submit a statistical report to the

training activities for at least twenty (20) hours per week, unless the parent is incapacitated as defined by 42
U.S.C. sec. 607.

obligations.

arise with respect to any disclosure which results from a good faith, but erroneous, interpretation. In any civil
action brought for reason of negligence of disclosure of financial records, upon finding of liability on the part
of the defendant, the defendant shall be liable to the plaintiff in an amount equal to:
(a) The sum of the greater of one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each act of unauthorized disclosure of
financial records; or
(b) The sum of the actual damages sustained by the plaintiff resulting from the unauthorized disclosure;
plus
(c) If willful disclosure or disclosure was a result of gross negligence, punitive damages, plus the costs,
