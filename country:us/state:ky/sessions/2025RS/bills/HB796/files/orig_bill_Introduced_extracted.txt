14 day notice was mailed, along with a certificate attesting that the notices
15 were mailed in accordance with the requirements of this section.
16 3. If the notice required by paragraph (c) of this subsection is returned as
17 undeliverable, and the property valuation administrator is not able to
18 provide a corrected or updated address, the county attorney or the
19 department shall address the sixty (60) day notice to "Occupant" and
20 shall mail the notice to the address of the property to which the
21 certificate of delinquency applies;
22 (e) The county attorney or the department shall deliver to the property valuation
23 administrator, at the same time the notice required by paragraph (d) of this
24 subsection is sent, a list of the owners whose tax bills remain delinquent. The

1 (f) Anytime after the expiration of the one (1) year tolling period established by
2 KRS 134.546, the county attorney or department may institute an action to
3 collect the amount due on a certificate of delinquency owned by the taxing
4 jurisdictions and in the possession of the county clerk. At least forty-five (45)
5 days before instituting a legal action, the county attorney or department shall
6 send, by regular mail, a notice of intent to initiate legal action to enforce the
7 lien. The notice shall be sent to the owner of record of the property or to the
8 in-care-of address or corrected address if either has been provided pursuant to
9 this section.
10 (5) If property subject to a certificate of delinquency has been transferred in any year
11 after the assessment date, the property valuation administrator shall determine the
12 in-care-of address supplied in the deed pursuant to KRS 382.135 and shall provide
13 that information to the county attorney or the department.
14 (6) (a) Failure of the county attorney or the department to mail the notices required in
15 subsection (4) of this section shall not affect the validity of the claim of the
16 state, county, school district, and taxing district. However, the county attorney
17 or the department shall not receive any compensation, commission, or
18 payment related to any certificate of delinquency for which the notices
19 required by the provisions of subsection (4) of this section are not sent.
20 (b) For each notice mailed, one dollar ($1) shall be added to the amount of the
21 certificate of delinquency, to offset the cost of mailing, and, upon collection,
22 the county attorney or the department shall be paid such amounts as
23 reimbursement for mailing costs.
24 (7) (a) As compensation for the collection duties performed pursuant to a contract
25 with the department, a county attorney shall be paid twenty percent (20%) of
26 the amount due each taxing unit during the contract period, whether the
27 amount is paid voluntarily, through sale, or under court order, and whether the

1 amount is paid to the county clerk or the county attorney. The fee for the
2 county attorney shall be added to the amount of the certificate of delinquency
3 and shall be paid by the person paying the certificate of delinquency.
4 (b) If payment in full is voluntarily made by the taxpayer to the county attorney
5 or county clerk within five (5) days of the filing of the tax claim with the
6 county clerk, the county attorney fee shall be waived.
7 (c) If a county attorney files a court action or files a cross-claim, the county
8 attorney shall be paid an additional fee of thirteen percent (13%) of the
9 amount of the certificate of delinquency and shall be reimbursed for costs
10 incident to the court action. The additional fee and costs incident to the
11 litigation shall be added to the certificate of delinquency and shall be paid by
12 the person paying the certificate of delinquency.
13 (d) If more than one (1) county attorney renders necessary services to collect on a
14 certificate of delinquency, the county attorney serving the last notice or
15 rendering the last substantial service preceding collection shall be entitled to
16 the fee.
17 (8) (a) The county attorney shall establish a system to accept installment payments
18 from delinquent taxpayers. The county attorney may, during the contract
19 period, enter into an agreement with a delinquent taxpayer to accept
20 installment payments on the certificates of delinquency. The agreement shall
21 not waive the county attorney's right to initiate court action or other
22 authorized collection activities if the taxpayer does not make payments in
23 accordance with the agreement.
24 (b) The county attorney may, upon written request of the taxpayer for good cause
25 and with agreement of the affected taxing jurisdiction or fee recipient, waive
26 or reduce fees and penalties that are part of a certificate of delinquency during
27 settlement or negotiation with a taxpayer in accordance with guidance

1 provided by the department.
2 (9) Any action by the county attorney authorized by this chapter shall be filed on
3 relation of the commissioner. A copy of any judgment obtained by the county
4 attorney shall be sent to the department.
5 (10) (a) The county attorney shall notify the county clerk and the department of the
6 filing of a suit at the time the suit is filed and of payment agreements at the
7 time such agreements are entered into. The county clerk shall note on the
8 certificate of delinquency the filing of the lawsuit or the existence of the
9 payment agreement, and these certificates of delinquency shall not be
10 available for purchase or payment by a third-party purchaser.
11 (b) The county attorney shall provide to the county clerk at least ten (10) days but
12 not more than twenty (20) days prior to the annual sale date for the county
13 established pursuant to KRS 134.128, a protected list of current year
14 certificates of delinquency that are:
15 1. Under a payment plan with the county attorney on which payments are
16 current;
17 2. Involved in litigation initiated by the county attorney or in which the
18 county attorney responds or files an answer;
19 3. Involved in bankruptcy litigation in which the county attorney has filed
20 a claim; or
21 4. Included on a list of protected properties submitted to the county
22 attorney by a vacant property review commission or an alternative
23 government entity as provided in KRS 99.727.
24 The list shall include sufficient detail for the county clerk to accurately
25 identify the property.
26 (c) The county attorney shall notify the county clerk of the failure of any payment
27 agreement and, upon notification to the clerk, the certificate of delinquency

1 shall be available for purchase.
2 (11) The department may make its delinquent tax collection databases and other
3 technical resources, including but not limited to tax refund offsetting, available to
4 the county attorney upon request from the county attorney. The county attorney
5 seeking assistance shall enter into any agreements required by the department to
6 protect taxpayer confidentiality, to ensure database integrity, or to address the
7 concerns of the department.
8 (12) (a) If a county attorney chooses not to contract for collection duties, or if a county
9 attorney fails to perform the duties required by the contract, the department
10 shall assume responsibility for all uncollected certificates of delinquency and
11 personal property certificates of delinquency, including, at the option of the
12 department, those with pending court action or for which the county attorney
13 has entered into an installment payment agreement.
14 (b) If the department assumes or retains responsibility for the collection of
15 certificates of delinquency and personal property certificates of delinquency,
16 the twenty percent (20%) fee that would have been paid to the county attorney
17 under subsection (7) of this section, and any other fees or costs established by
18 this section for the county attorney shall be paid to the department for deposit
19 in the delinquent tax fund provided for under KRS 134.552.
