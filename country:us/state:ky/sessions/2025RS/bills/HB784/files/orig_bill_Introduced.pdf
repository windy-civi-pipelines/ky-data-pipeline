UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1526
1 AN ACT relating to virtual programs and declaring an emergency.
2 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
3 Section 1. For the purposes of this section, "virtual program" means a program
4 offered by a public school district in which all offered courses in the program are virtual,
5 do not include regular in-person instruction, and are designed as an alternative to
6 traditional in-person school programs. An independent school district with a virtual
7 program enrollment that is greater than 2,000 students on the date of this Act becoming
8 law shall not enroll more students in the district's virtual programs for the remainder of
9 the 2024-2025 school year and the entirety of the 2025-2026 school year than the
10 district's total enrollment in virtual programs on that date.
11 Section 2. Due to the time-sensitive budget planning process for districts to
12 determine the allocation of resources to support virtual and traditional instruction in
13 school districts, an emergency is declared to exist, and this Act takes effect upon its
14 passage and approval by the Governor or upon its otherwise becoming a law.
