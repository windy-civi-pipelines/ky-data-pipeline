Section 1:
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 472
2 WHEREAS, the General Assembly finds that it is imperative that Kentucky's
3 children be equipped with information geared toward improving the likelihood of
4 successful outcomes throughout their lives; and
5 WHEREAS, an analysis of longitudinal survey data from the National Longitudinal
6 Survey of Youth by Wendy Wang and Brad Wilcox of the American Enterprise Institute
7 and the Institute for Family Studies showed that 97 percent of the studied individuals that
8 followed the "Success Sequence" and 86 percent of those "on track" but not having
9 completed the sequence were not living in poverty by the time they reached young
10 adulthood, while 53 percent of young adults who did not follow this sequence at all were
11 living in poverty; and
12 WHEREAS, Wang and Wilcox also found that the odds of reaching middle-income
13 status were 9.4 times higher for people who followed the "Success Sequence" compared
14 to those who did not meet any of the milestones, when controlling for race, ethnicity,
15 gender, and other background factors; and
16 WHEREAS, in their 2013 research paper on the "Five Strong Starts for Social
17 Mobility," Richard Reeves and Kerry Searle Grannis at the Brookings Institute showed a
18 strong, positive correlation between the percentage of individuals at different income
19 levels who achieved the strong starts, which include sequentially achieving a strong
20 educational foundation, entry into the labor market, lack of criminal conviction, and
21 getting married before having your first child;
