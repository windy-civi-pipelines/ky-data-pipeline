1 (b) [The Kentucky Board of Education or the Kentucky Department of Education
2 shall not require or recommend policies or procedures for the use of pronouns
3 that do not conform to a student's biological sex as indicated on the student's
4 original, unedited birth certificate issued at the time of birth pursuant to KRS
5 156.070(2)(g)2.
6 (c) ]A local school district shall request[not require] school personnel and[or]
7 students to use gender-appropriate pronouns for a child when a parent has

11 paragraph (b) of this subsection].
12 (c)[(d)] Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit a school district or district
13 personnel from withholding information from a parent if a reasonably prudent
14 person would believe[, based on previous conduct and history,] that the
15 disclosure would result in the child becoming a dependent child or an abused
16 or neglected child as defined in KRS 600.020. The fact that district personnel
17 withhold information from a parent under this subsection shall not in itself
18 constitute evidence of failure to report dependency, neglect, or abuse to the
19 Cabinet for Health and Family Services under KRS 620.030.
20 (6) [Prior to a well-being questionnaire or assessment, or a health screening form being
21 given to a child for research purposes, a school district shall provide the student's

25 indicator of having a belief regarding the topic of the assessment or form.

2 district's policies; or
3 (b) Remove the duty to report pursuant to KRS 620.030 if district personnel has
4 reasonable cause to believe the child is a dependent child or an abused or
5 neglected child due to the risk of physical or emotional injury identified in
6 KRS 600.020(1)(a)2. or as otherwise provided in that statute.

15 of a different biological sex].
16 (4) (a) A student whose parent has submitted a request for accommodation[ who

21 the best available accommodation that ensures individual privacy for the
22 child in[, but that accommodation shall not include] the use of school
23 restrooms, locker rooms, or shower rooms[ designated for use by students of
24 the opposite biological sex while students of the opposite biological sex are
25 present or could be present].
