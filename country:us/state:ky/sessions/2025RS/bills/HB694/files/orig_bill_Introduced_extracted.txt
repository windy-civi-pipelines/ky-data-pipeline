14 (3) All employers who employ nonuniversity members shall make a contribution for
15 each payroll on behalf of their active employees who participate in the Teachers'
16 Retirement System in an amount equal to three percent (3%) of payroll of those
17 active employees. Except as provided in Section 1 of this Act, the contribution
18 specified by this subsection shall be used to fund retiree health benefits.
19 (4) When the funds established to actuarially fund pension annuities and the medical
20 insurance fund established under KRS 161.420[(5)] each achieve an actuarial
21 funding level of at least one hundred percent (100%)[achieves a sufficient
22 prefunded status] as determined by the annual actuarial valuation[Teachers'

24 Assembly that the contributions required under subsections (1)(c)2. and (e)3. and
25 (3) of this section shall, in an actuarially accountable manner, be either decreased,
26 suspended, or eliminated. The decrease, suspension, or elimination in contributions

1 five thousandths percent (2.025%) of annual compensation. The decrease,
2 suspension, or elimination in contributions required under subsection (1)(e)3. of this
3 section shall not exceed one and twenty-five hundredths percent (1.25%) of annual
4 compensation.
5 (5) Each employer shall remit the required employer contributions to the retirement
6 system under the terms and conditions specified for member contributions under

9 161.515, 161.545, 161.553, 161.605, 161.612, and 161.620(1), (3), (5), (6), and (7).
10 In the event an annual appropriation is less than the amount of these requirements,
11 the state shall make up the deficit in the next biennium budget appropriation to the
12 retirement system. Employer contributions to the retirement system are for the
13 exclusive purpose of providing benefits to members and annuitants and these
14 contributions shall be considered deferred compensation to the members. This

16 on or after January 1, 2022.
17 Section 5. KRS 161.675 is amended to read as follows:
18 (1) The board of trustees shall arrange by appropriate contract or on a self-insured basis
19 to provide a broad program of group hospital and medical insurance for present and
20 future eligible recipients of a retirement allowance from the Teachers' Retirement
21 System. The board of trustees may also arrange to provide health insurance
22 coverage through an insurer licensed pursuant to Subtitle 38 of KRS Chapter 304
23 and offering a managed care plan as defined in KRS 304.17A-500 as an alternative
24 to group hospital and medical insurance for persons eligible for hospital and

26 recipients of a retirement allowance from the Teachers' Retirement System who are
27 less than age sixty-five (65) to be included in the state-sponsored health insurance
Page 15 of 20

1 that is provided to active teachers and state employees under KRS 18A.225.
2 Members who are sixty-five (65) or older and retired for service shall not be
3 eligible to participate in the state employee health insurance program as described
4 in KRS 18A.225.
5 (2) (a) The coverage provided shall be as set forth in the contracts and the
6 administrative regulations of the board of trustees. The board of trustees may
7 change the levels of coverage and eligibility conditions to meet the changing
8 needs of the annuitants and, when necessary, to contain the expenses of the
9 insurance program within the funds available to finance the insurance
10 program, except as provided by paragraph (b) of this subsection. The
11 contracts and administrative regulations shall provide for but not be limited to
12 hospital room and board, surgical procedures, doctors' care in the hospital,
13 and miscellaneous hospital costs. An annuitant whose effective date of
14 retirement is July 1, 1974, and thereafter, must have a minimum of five (5)
15 years' creditable Kentucky service in the Teachers' Retirement System or five
16 (5) years of combined creditable service in the state-administered retirement
17 systems if the member is retiring under the reciprocity provisions of KRS
18 61.680, 61.702, and 78.5536. An annuitant shall not elect coverage through
19 more than one (1) of the state-administered retirement systems. The board of
20 trustees shall offer coverage to the disabled child of an annuitant regardless of
21 the disabled child's age if the annuitant pays the entire premium for the
22 disabled child's coverage. A child shall be considered disabled if he or she has
23 been determined to be eligible for federal Social Security disability benefits.
24 (b) Individuals who become members of the Kentucky Teachers' Retirement
25 System on or after July 1, 2008, shall not be eligible for benefits under this
26 section unless the member has at least fifteen (15) or more years of service
27 credited under KRS 161.500 or another state-administered retirement system.

1 (3) All expenses for benefits under this section shall be paid from the funding
2 provisions contained in KRS 161.420(5), from a trust fund established by the board
3 under 26 U.S.C. sec. 115, premium charges received from the annuitants and the
4 spouses, and from funds that may be appropriated or allocated by statute.
5 (4) (a) The board of trustees shall determine the amount of health insurance
6 supplement payments that the Teachers' Retirement System will provide to
7 assist eligible annuitants in paying the cost of their health insurance, based on
8 the funds available in the medical insurance fund and any trust fund
9 established by the board for this purpose under 26 U.S.C. sec. 115. The board
10 of trustees shall establish the maximum monthly amounts of health insurance
11 supplement payments that will be made by the Kentucky Teachers'
12 Retirement System for eligible annuitants. The board of trustees shall
13 annually establish the percentage of the maximum monthly health insurance
14 supplement payment that will be made, based on age and years of service
15 credit of eligible recipients of a retirement allowance. Monthly health
16 insurance supplement payments made by the retirement system may not
17 exceed the amount of the single coverage insurance premium chosen by the
18 eligible annuitants. In order to qualify for health insurance supplements, the
19 annuitant must agree to pay the difference between the insurance premium
20 and the applicable supplement payment, by payroll deduction from his or her
21 retirement allowance, or by a payment method approved by the retirement
22 system.
23 (b) 1. The board shall, effective July 1, 2010, have the authority to charge
24 retired members who are not paying the Standard Medicare Part B
25 premium an amount equal to the Standard Medicare Part B premium in
26 addition to any other payments determined by the board to be necessary
27 to contain costs within the available funding. If the board determines
Page 17 of 20
BR007700.100 - 77 - XXXX 2/26/2025 3:44 PM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 77
1 that retired members who are not paying the Standard Medicare Part B
2 premium should pay the equivalent of the Standard Medicare Part B
3 premium, the board shall phase in the premium according to the
4 following schedule:
5 July 1, 2010............. ....................................... Thirty-three percent (33%)
6 July 1, 2011........ ............................................. Sixty-seven percent (67%)
7 July 1, 2012, and thereafter ......................... One hundred percent (100%)
8 2. If the board requires retired members to pay the charges specified in
9 subparagraph 1. of this paragraph, the amount payable shall not be
10 reduced by the board until the funds established to actuarially fund
11 pension annuities and the medical insurance fund established under
12 Section 2 of this Act each achieve an actuarial funding level of at least
13 one hundred percent (100%).
14 3. Nothing in this paragraph shall limit the board's authority to change the
15 levels of coverage, eligibility conditions, or levels of health insurance
16 supplement for retirees in order to contain costs within available
17 funding.
18 (c) The board of trustees may offer, on a full-cost basis, health care insurance
19 coverage provided by the retirement system to spouses and dependents of
20 eligible annuitants not otherwise eligible for regular coverage. Recipients of a
21 retirement allowance from the retirement system must agree to pay the cost of
22 this coverage by payroll deduction from their retirement allowance or by a
23 payment method approved by the retirement system.
24 (d) The board of trustees shall offer, on a full-cost basis, health insurance
25 coverage provided by the retirement system to the disabled child of an
26 annuitant, regardless of the age of the disabled child. A child shall be
27 considered disabled for purposes of this section if the child has been

1 determined to be eligible for federal Social Security disability benefits.
2 (5) The board of trustees is empowered to require the annuitant and the annuitant's
3 spouse to pay a premium charge to assist in the financing of the hospital and
4 medical insurance program. The board of trustees is empowered to pay the
5 expenses for insurance coverage from the medical insurance fund, from any trust
6 fund established by the board for this purpose under 26 U.S.C. sec. 115, from the
7 premium charges received from the annuitants and the spouses, and from funds that
8 may be appropriated or allocated by statute. The board may provide insurance
9 coverage by making payment to insurance carriers including health insurance plans
10 that are available to active and retired state employees and active teachers,
11 institutions, and individuals for services performed, or the board of trustees may
12 elect to provide insurance on a "self-insurance" basis or a combination of these
13 provisions.
14 (6) The board of trustees may approve health insurance supplement payments to
15 eligible annuitants who are less than sixty-five (65) years of age, as reimbursement
16 for hospital and medical insurance premiums made by annuitants for their
17 individual coverage. Eligible annuitants or recipients are those annuitants who are
18 not eligible for Medicare and who do not reside in Kentucky or in an area outside of
19 Kentucky where comparable coverage is available. The reimbursement payments
20 shall not exceed the minimum supplement payment that would have been made had
21 the annuitant lived in Kentucky. Eligible annuitants or recipients shall submit proof
22 of payment to the retirement system for hospital and medical insurance that they
23 have obtained. Reimbursement payments shall be made on a quarterly basis.
24 (7) Contracts negotiated may include the provision that a stated amount of hospital cost
25 or period of hospitalization shall incur no obligation on the part of the insurance
26 carrier or the retirement system or any trust fund established for this purpose by the
27 board.

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 77
1 (8) The board of trustees is empowered to promulgate administrative regulations to
2 assure efficient operation of the hospital and medical insurance program.
3 (9) Premiums paid for hospital and medical insurance coverage procured under
4 authority of this section shall be exempt from any premium tax which might
5 otherwise be required under KRS Chapter 136. The payment of premiums by the
6 medical insurance fund or another trust fund established by the board for this
7 purpose shall not constitute taxable income to an insured recipient.
8 (10) In the event that a member is providing services on less than a full-time basis under
9 KRS 161.605, the retirement system may pay the full cost of the member's health
10 insurance coverage for the full fiscal year that the member is providing those
11 services, at the conclusion of which, the retirement system may then bill the active
12 employer and the active employer shall reimburse the retirement system for the cost
13 of the health insurance coverage incurred by the retirement system on a pro rata
14 basis for the time that the member was employed by the active employer.

17 (100%) as determined by the annual actuarial valuation, the employer
18 contributions for retiree health benefits as provided in subsections (1)(a)2., (b)2.,
19 (c)2., (d)3., and (e)3. and (3) of Section 4 of this Act shall be deposited into the

23 year following the annual actuarial valuation in which the criteria of this
24 subsection are first met.
25 (3) After reaching an actuarial funding level of at least one hundred percent (100%),

16 insurance supplement payments made by the retirement system may not
17 exceed the amount of the single coverage insurance premium chosen by the
18 eligible annuitants. In order to qualify for health insurance supplements, the
19 annuitant must agree to pay the difference between the insurance premium
20 and the applicable supplement payment, by payroll deduction from his or her
21 retirement allowance, or by a payment method approved by the retirement
22 system.
23 (b) 1. The board shall, effective July 1, 2010, have the authority to charge
24 retired members who are not paying the Standard Medicare Part B
25 premium an amount equal to the Standard Medicare Part B premium in
26 addition to any other payments determined by the board to be necessary
27 to contain costs within the available funding. If the board determines

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 77
1 that retired members who are not paying the Standard Medicare Part B
2 premium should pay the equivalent of the Standard Medicare Part B
3 premium, the board shall phase in the premium according to the
4 following schedule:
5 July 1, 2010............. ....................................... Thirty-three percent (33%)
6 July 1, 2011........ ............................................. Sixty-seven percent (67%)
7 July 1, 2012, and thereafter ......................... One hundred percent (100%)
8 2. If the board requires retired members to pay the charges specified in
9 subparagraph 1. of this paragraph, the amount payable shall not be
10 reduced by the board until the funds established to actuarially fund
11 pension annuities and the medical insurance fund established under
12 Section 2 of this Act each achieve an actuarial funding level of at least
13 one hundred percent (100%).
14 3. Nothing in this paragraph shall limit the board's authority to change the
15 levels of coverage, eligibility conditions, or levels of health insurance
16 supplement for retirees in order to contain costs within available
17 funding.
18 (c) The board of trustees may offer, on a full-cost basis, health care insurance
19 coverage provided by the retirement system to spouses and dependents of
20 eligible annuitants not otherwise eligible for regular coverage. Recipients of a
21 retirement allowance from the retirement system must agree to pay the cost of
22 this coverage by payroll deduction from their retirement allowance or by a
23 payment method approved by the retirement system.
24 (d) The board of trustees shall offer, on a full-cost basis, health insurance
25 coverage provided by the retirement system to the disabled child of an
26 annuitant, regardless of the age of the disabled child. A child shall be
27 considered disabled for purposes of this section if the child has been

1 determined to be eligible for federal Social Security disability benefits.
2 (5) The board of trustees is empowered to require the annuitant and the annuitant's
3 spouse to pay a premium charge to assist in the financing of the hospital and
4 medical insurance program. The board of trustees is empowered to pay the
5 expenses for insurance coverage from the medical insurance fund, from any trust
6 fund established by the board for this purpose under 26 U.S.C. sec. 115, from the
7 premium charges received from the annuitants and the spouses, and from funds that
8 may be appropriated or allocated by statute. The board may provide insurance
9 coverage by making payment to insurance carriers including health insurance plans
10 that are available to active and retired state employees and active teachers,
11 institutions, and individuals for services performed, or the board of trustees may
12 elect to provide insurance on a "self-insurance" basis or a combination of these
13 provisions.
14 (6) The board of trustees may approve health insurance supplement payments to
15 eligible annuitants who are less than sixty-five (65) years of age, as reimbursement
16 for hospital and medical insurance premiums made by annuitants for their
17 individual coverage. Eligible annuitants or recipients are those annuitants who are
18 not eligible for Medicare and who do not reside in Kentucky or in an area outside of
19 Kentucky where comparable coverage is available. The reimbursement payments
20 shall not exceed the minimum supplement payment that would have been made had
21 the annuitant lived in Kentucky. Eligible annuitants or recipients shall submit proof
22 of payment to the retirement system for hospital and medical insurance that they
23 have obtained. Reimbursement payments shall be made on a quarterly basis.
24 (7) Contracts negotiated may include the provision that a stated amount of hospital cost
25 or period of hospitalization shall incur no obligation on the part of the insurance
26 carrier or the retirement system or any trust fund established for this purpose by the
27 board.

1 (8) The board of trustees is empowered to promulgate administrative regulations to
2 assure efficient operation of the hospital and medical insurance program.
3 (9) Premiums paid for hospital and medical insurance coverage procured under
4 authority of this section shall be exempt from any premium tax which might
5 otherwise be required under KRS Chapter 136. The payment of premiums by the
6 medical insurance fund or another trust fund established by the board for this
7 purpose shall not constitute taxable income to an insured recipient.
8 (10) In the event that a member is providing services on less than a full-time basis under
9 KRS 161.605, the retirement system may pay the full cost of the member's health
10 insurance coverage for the full fiscal year that the member is providing those
11 services, at the conclusion of which, the retirement system may then bill the active
12 employer and the active employer shall reimburse the retirement system for the cost
13 of the health insurance coverage incurred by the retirement system on a pro rata
14 basis for the time that the member was employed by the active employer.
