1 A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION expressing Kentucky's support for the Crisis
2 Recovery Support Network coordinated by the Southern Regional Education Board,
3 expressing support for Kentucky's participation in the network, and recognizing the
4 network as a trusted support for Kentucky schools, districts, and postsecondary
5 institutions to know they may call upon if the need arises.
6 WHEREAS, after natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods, after
7 school shootings, and in public emergencies, recovery must be prioritized as a long-term
8 process, rather than an immediate response only; and
9 WHEREAS, states, school districts, and postsecondary institutions have focused on
10 crisis prevention and management, but may not have the capacity to provide sustained
11 counseling support for their students, teachers, communities, and even their own
12 counselors during the recovery stage; and
13 WHEREAS, rural school districts and institutions in particular tend to have fewer
14 counselors and limited access to additional counseling resources; and
15 WHEREAS, school counselors are often expected to respond to student needs after
16 tragedy, even as they themselves grapple with the emotional toll, underscoring the need
17 for external support for the entire school community; and
18 WHEREAS, schools and institutions affected by crisis may require at least a year of
19 dedicated support to fully recover; and
20 WHEREAS, recovery efforts can strain resources that are already stretched thin,
21 given that a National Center for Education Statistics study showed that less than half of
22 public schools surveyed believe that their school is equipped to provide mental health
23 services to all students in need; and
24 WHEREAS, recovery is an extended healing process for students and adults alike,
25 and having additional counselors come to the aid of a school or institution in extreme
26 need supports the healing process of all people in the community, including teachers and
27 counselors; and

1 WHEREAS, specialized training for counselors is essential to ensure they have
2 received psychological first aid training and provide counseling that aligns with the
3 unique needs of an educational environment; and
4 WHEREAS, research shows that students who receive adequate support after a
5 crisis are more likely to succeed academically, remain in school, and contribute positively
6 to society; and
7 WHEREAS, the Southern Regional Education Board (SREB), with its 75-year
8 history of partnering with states to improve education, is uniquely equipped to lead this
9 effort because of its ability to mobilize key education and policymaking stakeholders at
10 all levels; and
11 WHEREAS, SREB will cover the cost of a coordinator to operate the network, as
12 well as travel costs for network counselors during training and deployment; and
13 WHEREAS, SREB has secured funding for the first two years of training for a pool
14 of counselors from each SREB state; and
15 WHEREAS, the Kentucky General Assembly is aware that SREB will ask states for
16 $10,000 in additional funding in two years to sustain training of counselors;
17 NOW, THEREFORE,
18 Be it resolved by the Senate of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of
19 Kentucky, the House of Representatives concurring therein:
20 Section 1. To meet the urgent need for a coordinated, region-wide effort to
21 provide consistent long-term counseling capacity that is ready to deploy immediately
22 after a crisis is managed, the Kentucky General Assembly supports the mission of the
23 Southern Regional Education Board (SREB) Crisis Recovery Support Network. The
24 SREB, in close collaboration with governors’ offices, state education agencies, local
25 school districts, and postsecondary institutions, will complement existing school and
26 district crisis management efforts by focusing on long-term healing and psychological
27 resilience by deploying counselors with specialized training to schools in extreme need.
