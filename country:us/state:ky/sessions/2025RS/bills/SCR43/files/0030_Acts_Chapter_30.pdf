CHAPTER 30
( SCR 43 )
A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION expressing Kentucky's support for the Crisis Recovery Support Network
coordinated by the Southern Regional Education Board, expressing support for Kentucky's participation in the
network, and recognizing the network as a trusted support for Kentucky schools, districts, and postsecondary
institutions to know they may call upon if the need arises.
WHEREAS, after natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods, after school shootings, and in
public emergencies, recovery must be prioritized as a long-term process, rather than an immediate response only; and
WHEREAS, states, school districts, and postsecondary institutions have focused on crisis prevention and
management, but may not have the capacity to provide sustained counseling support for their students, teachers,
communities, and even their own counselors during the recovery stage; and
WHEREAS, rural school districts and institutions in particular tend to have fewer counselors and limited
access to additional counseling resources; and
WHEREAS, school counselors are often expected to respond to student needs after tragedy, even as they
themselves grapple with the emotional toll, underscoring the need for external support for the entire school
community; and
WHEREAS, schools and institutions affected by crisis may require at least a year of dedicated support to fully
recover; and
WHEREAS, recovery efforts can strain resources that are already stretched thin, given that a National Center
for Education Statistics study showed that less than half of public schools surveyed believe that their school is
equipped to provide mental health services to all students in need; and
WHEREAS, recovery is an extended healing process for students and adults alike, and having additional
counselors come to the aid of a school or institution in extreme need supports the healing process of all people in the
community, including teachers and counselors; and
WHEREAS, specialized training for counselors is essential to ensure they have received psychological first aid
training and provide counseling that aligns with the unique needs of an educational environment; and
WHEREAS, research shows that students who receive adequate support after a crisis are more likely to
succeed academically, remain in school, and contribute positively to society; and
WHEREAS, the Southern Regional Education Board (SREB), with its 75-year history of partnering with states
to improve education, is uniquely equipped to lead this effort because of its ability to mobilize key education and
policymaking stakeholders at all levels; and
WHEREAS, SREB will cover the cost of a coordinator to operate the network, as well as travel costs for
network counselors during training and deployment; and
WHEREAS, SREB has secured funding for the first two years of training for a pool of counselors from each
SREB state; and
WHEREAS, the Kentucky General Assembly is aware that SREB will ask states for $10,000 in additional
funding in two years to sustain training of counselors;
NOW, THEREFORE,
Be it resolved by the Senate of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, the House of
Representatives concurring therein:
Section 1. To meet the urgent need for a coordinated, region-wide effort to provide consistent long-term
counseling capacity that is ready to deploy immediately after a crisis is managed, the Kentucky General Assembly
supports the mission of the Southern Regional Education Board (SREB) Crisis Recovery Support Network. The
SREB, in close collaboration with governors’ offices, state education agencies, local school districts, and
postsecondary institutions, will complement existing school and district crisis management efforts by focusing on
long-term healing and psychological resilience by deploying counselors with specialized training to schools in
extreme need.
