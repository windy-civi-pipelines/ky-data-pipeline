2 (1) After termination of a lease, the tenant is entitled to the amount by which the
3 security deposit and any unearned rent exceeds the amount the landlord is owed
4 under the lease or Sections 1 to 61 of this Act.
5 (2) Not later than thirty (30) days after a lease terminates and the tenant vacates the
6 premises, the landlord shall determine the amount the landlord believes the
7 tenant is entitled to under subsection (1) of this section and:
8 (a) Tender that amount to the tenant or, if the tenant has died, the tenant
9 representative;
10 (b) Send that amount by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to an address
11 provided by the tenant or, if the tenant has died, the tenant representative
12 or, in the absence of that address, to the relevant address specified in
13 Section 8 of this Act; or
14 (c) Cause a funds transfer in that amount to be made, with the cost of transfer
15 paid, to a bank account designated by the tenant or, if the tenant has died,
16 the tenant's representative.
17 (3) If the amount under subsection (2) of this section is less than the sum of the
18 tenant’s security deposit and any unearned rent, the landlord shall provide the
19 tenant or tenant representative, within the period specified under subsection (2)
20 of this section, a record specifying each item of property damage or other
21 unfulfilled obligation of the tenant to which the security deposit or unearned rent
22 was applied and the amount applied to each item.

2 or two (2) times the amount recoverable under subsection (4) of this section,
3 whichever is greater, unless the landlord’s only noncompliance was the failure to
4 comply with subsection (2)(b) of this section as a result of the inadvertent failure
5 to pay the cost of postage or transmission or to use the proper address.
6 (6) If a security deposit and unearned rent held by a landlord are insufficient to
7 satisfy the tenant’s obligations under the lease and Sections 1 to 61 of this Act,

15 interest in the premises any security deposit being held by the landlord and
16 notify the tenant in a record of the successor’s name and address, the
17 amount transferred, and any claim previously made against the security
18 deposit; or
19 (b) If the lease terminates as a result of the termination of the landlord’s
20 interest, comply with Section 59 of this Act.
21 (2) If a landlord dies before the termination of the lease, the personal representative
22 of the landlord’s estate becomes the landlord until the premises are distributed to

24 termination of the lease, the security deposit held by the representative must be
25 transferred to the successor and the representative shall notify the tenant in a
26 record of the successor’s name and address, the amount transferred to the
27 successor, and any claim previously made against the security deposit. If the

2 the representative shall comply with Section 59 of this Act.

4 subsection (1) or (2) of this section, the landlord or the estate has no further
5 liability with respect to the security deposit.
6 (4) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (5) of this section, a successor to a
7 landlord’s interest in the premises has all rights and obligations of the landlord
8 under Sections 1 to 61 of this Act with respect to any security deposit held by the
9 predecessor landlord which has not been returned to the tenant, whether or not
10 the security deposit was transferred or distributed to the successor.
11 (5) If a landlord’s interest is terminated by foreclosure, the successor’s liability
12 under subsection (4) of this section is limited to the security deposit received by
13 the successor.

4 under the lease or Sections 1 to 61 of this Act.
5 (2) Not later than thirty (30) days after a lease terminates and the tenant vacates the
6 premises, the landlord shall determine the amount the landlord believes the
7 tenant is entitled to under subsection (1) of this section and:
8 (a) Tender that amount to the tenant or, if the tenant has died, the tenant
9 representative;
10 (b) Send that amount by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to an address
11 provided by the tenant or, if the tenant has died, the tenant representative
12 or, in the absence of that address, to the relevant address specified in
13 Section 8 of this Act; or
14 (c) Cause a funds transfer in that amount to be made, with the cost of transfer
15 paid, to a bank account designated by the tenant or, if the tenant has died,
16 the tenant's representative.
17 (3) If the amount under subsection (2) of this section is less than the sum of the
18 tenant’s security deposit and any unearned rent, the landlord shall provide the
19 tenant or tenant representative, within the period specified under subsection (2)
20 of this section, a record specifying each item of property damage or other
21 unfulfilled obligation of the tenant to which the security deposit or unearned rent

2 or two (2) times the amount recoverable under subsection (4) of this section,
3 whichever is greater, unless the landlord’s only noncompliance was the failure to
4 comply with subsection (2)(b) of this section as a result of the inadvertent failure
5 to pay the cost of postage or transmission or to use the proper address.
6 (6) If a security deposit and unearned rent held by a landlord are insufficient to
7 satisfy the tenant’s obligations under the lease and Sections 1 to 61 of this Act,

15 interest in the premises any security deposit being held by the landlord and
16 notify the tenant in a record of the successor’s name and address, the
17 amount transferred, and any claim previously made against the security
18 deposit; or
19 (b) If the lease terminates as a result of the termination of the landlord’s
20 interest, comply with Section 59 of this Act.
21 (2) If a landlord dies before the termination of the lease, the personal representative
22 of the landlord’s estate becomes the landlord until the premises are distributed to

24 termination of the lease, the security deposit held by the representative must be
25 transferred to the successor and the representative shall notify the tenant in a
26 record of the successor’s name and address, the amount transferred to the
27 successor, and any claim previously made against the security deposit. If the

2 the representative shall comply with Section 59 of this Act.
3 (3) If a landlord or personal representative of the landlord’s estate complies with
4 subsection (1) or (2) of this section, the landlord or the estate has no further
5 liability with respect to the security deposit.
6 (4) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (5) of this section, a successor to a
7 landlord’s interest in the premises has all rights and obligations of the landlord
8 under Sections 1 to 61 of this Act with respect to any security deposit held by the
9 predecessor landlord which has not been returned to the tenant, whether or not
10 the security deposit was transferred or distributed to the successor.
11 (5) If a landlord’s interest is terminated by foreclosure, the successor’s liability
12 under subsection (4) of this section is limited to the security deposit received by
13 the successor.
