14 health professional, or a disability as defined in Section 1 of this Act, if the
15 mental illness, intellectual disability, or disability[which] renders the parent
16 consistently unable to care for the immediate and ongoing physical or

18 (b) Acts of abuse or neglect as defined in KRS 600.020(1) toward any child in the

24 KRS 610.127 for not requiring reasonable efforts have been

1 assessment of the parent, or has received a written acknowledgement
2 from the parent knowingly and affirmatively rejecting the offered
3 services;
4 (d) The efforts and adjustments the parent has made in his or her circumstances,

12 (4) If the child has been placed with the cabinet, the parent may present testimony
13 concerning the reunification, adaptive, or supportive services offered by the cabinet
14 and whether additional services would be likely to bring about lasting parental
15 adjustment enabling a return of the child to the parent.
16 (5) If the parent proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the child will not
17 continue to be an abused or neglected child as defined in KRS 600.020(1) if
18 returned to the parent, or if the parent proves by a preponderance of the evidence
19 that appropriate and specifically targeted adaptive or supportive services based
20 upon an individual assessment of the parent have not been offered or provided to
21 the parent, the court in its discretion may determine not to terminate parental rights.
22 (6) Upon the conclusion of proof and argument of counsel, the Circuit Court shall enter
23 findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a decision as to each parent-respondent
24 within thirty (30) days either:
25 (a) Terminating the right of the parent; or
26 (b) Dismissing the petition and stating whether the child shall be returned to the
27 parent or shall remain in the custody of the state.

20 secretary.

22 study, the secretary shall grant or refuse permission for the applicant to place or
23 receive a child as early as practicable, but, in any case, the decision shall be made

1 Public Safety Cabinet or the Administrative Office of the Courts and a
2 background check of child abuse and neglect records maintained by the

4 check required for temporary custody shall be part of the home study required
5 under subsection (2) of this section.
6 (c) If the application is denied by the secretary, the temporary custody order shall
7 be set aside and, upon motion of the cabinet or of the child's parent or parents,
8 the Circuit Court may order the child returned to the biological parent or
9 parents or the child's custody may be awarded to the cabinet, another licensed
10 child-placing agency, or other individuals deemed appropriate by the court.
11 (d) This section shall not be deemed to permit the completion of any adoption
12 proceeding without the approval of the secretary and compliance with KRS
13 615.030, if required.
14 (9) (a) In any case where the cabinet refuses to approve the placement of a child for
15 adoption when requested by the parent or parents of the child, or refuses the
16 request of any person or persons that a child be placed with that person or
17 those persons for adoption, the decision of the secretary in so refusing shall be
18 final unless within ten (10) days after notice of refusal, the biological or
19 proposed adopting parent or parents shall appeal to the Circuit Court of the
20 county in which the adoption is proposed.
21 (b) No placement shall be disapproved:
22 1. On the basis of the religious, ethnic, racial, or interfaith background of
23 the adoptive applicant, if the placement is made with the consent of the
24 parent; or
25 2. On the sole basis of a disability of the adoptive applicant without
26 considering whether targeted adaptive or supportive services could
27 enable the applicant to provide essential care and protection for the
Page 8 of 16

1 child.
2 (10) (a) The cabinet may refuse to approve the placement of a child for adoption if the
3 child's custodial parent is unwilling for the child to be placed for adoption
4 with the proposed adoptive family. The cabinet may approve or deny the
5 placement, in spite of the fact that the custodial parent or parents are unwilling
6 to be interviewed by the cabinet or other approving entity, or if, after diligent
7 efforts have been made, the adoption worker is unable to locate or interview
8 the custodial parent or parents.
9 (b) The cabinet shall be made a party defendant to any[the] appeal taken under
10 subsection (9) of this section. In the hearing of an appeal, the court shall
11 review the findings of the secretary and shall determine if the secretary has
12 acted arbitrarily, unlawfully, or in a manner that constitutes an abuse of
13 discretion.
14 (11) If a child who does not fall within the exception provided for in KRS 199.470(4) is
15 placed or received in a home without the court's review of the background check
16 required under this section or the permission of the secretary for health and family
17 services, or if permission to receive a child has been denied, a representative of the
18 cabinet shall notify in writing or may petition the juvenile session of District Court
19 of the county in which the child is found setting out the facts concerning the child.
20 When the petition has been filed, the court shall take jurisdiction of the child and
21 shall provide for it as it would provide for a dependent, neglected, or abused child
22 under KRS Chapter 620, except that the child may not be placed in the home of the
23 applicants who are to receive the child unless permission to do so is granted by the
24 secretary or the action is ordered by a Kentucky court of competent jurisdiction.
25 (12) When either the custodial parent or parents of the child to be placed or the persons
26 wishing to receive the child reside out-of-state, the requirement of KRS 615.030,
27 Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children, shall be met before the cabinet

3 nonrefundable fee of two hundred dollars ($200) upon the filing of the written
4 application for permission to place or receive a child. Payment shall be made by
5 certified or cashier's check only. All funds collected under this section shall be
6 deposited in a restricted account, which is hereby created, for the purpose of
7 subsidizing an adoptive parent for suitable care of a special-needs child as
8 authorized in KRS 199.555.
9 (14) Nothing in this statute shall be construed to limit the authority of the cabinet or a
10 child-placing institution or agency to determine the proper disposition of a child
11 committed to it by the juvenile session of District Court or the Circuit Court, prior
12 to the filing of an application to place or receive a child.
13 Section 4. KRS 625.050 is amended to read as follows:
14 (1) A petition for involuntary termination of parental rights shall be entitled "In the

13 Section 5. KRS 625.090 is amended to read as follows:
14 (1) The Circuit Court may involuntarily terminate all parental rights of a parent of a

1 abuse treatment or recovery program and a regimen of prenatal
2 care or postnatal care as recommended by her health care
3 practitioner throughout the remaining term of her pregnancy or the
4 appropriate time after her pregnancy; or
5 c. In the absence of a prescription for the treatment of a legitimate
6 medical condition, agrees, prior to discharge from the hospital, to
7 participate in a court-ordered assessment by a drug treatment
8 provider and the assigning of a certified peer support specialist for
9 referral to appropriate treatment, and agrees to participate in
10 treatment which shall commence within ninety (90) days after the
11 birth; or
12 4. The parent has been convicted of a criminal charge relating to the
13 physical or sexual abuse or neglect of any child and that physical or
14 sexual abuse, neglect, or emotional injury to the child named in the
15 present termination action is likely to occur if the parental rights are not
16 terminated;
17 (b) 1. The Cabinet for Health and Family Services has filed a petition with the
18 court pursuant to KRS 620.180 or 625.050; or
19 2. A child-placing agency licensed by the cabinet, any county or

21 under KRS 625.050; and
22 (c) Termination would be in the best interest of the child.

27 (90) days;
Page 13 of 16
BR032700.100 - 327 - XXXX 2/13/2025 2:52 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 327
1 (b) That the parent has inflicted or allowed to be inflicted upon the child, by other
2 than accidental means, serious physical injury;
3 (c) That the parent has continuously or repeatedly inflicted or allowed to be
4 inflicted upon the child, by other than accidental means, physical injury or
5 emotional harm;
6 (d) That the parent has been convicted of a felony that involved the infliction of
7 serious physical injury to any child;
8 (e) That the parent, for a period of not less than six (6) months, has continuously
9 or repeatedly failed or refused to provide or has been substantially incapable
10 of providing essential parental care and protection for the child and that there
11 is no reasonable expectation of improvement in parental care and protection,
12 considering the age of the child;
13 (f) That the parent has caused or allowed the child to be sexually abused or
14 exploited;
15 (g) That the parent, for reasons other than poverty alone, has continuously or
16 repeatedly failed to provide or is incapable of providing essential food,
17 clothing, shelter, medical care, or education reasonably necessary and
18 available for the child's well-being and that there is no reasonable expectation
19 of significant improvement in the parent's conduct in the immediately
20 foreseeable future, considering the age of the child;
21 (h) That:
22 1. The parent's parental rights to another child have been involuntarily
23 terminated;
24 2. The child named in the present termination action was born subsequent
25 to or during the pendency of the previous termination; and
26 3. The conditions or factors which were the basis for the previous
27 termination finding have not been corrected;
Page 14 of 16
BR032700.100 - 327 - XXXX 2/13/2025 2:52 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 327
1 (i) That the parent has been convicted in a criminal proceeding of having caused
2 or contributed to the death of another child as a result of physical or sexual
3 abuse or neglect;
4 (j) That the child has been in foster care under the responsibility of the cabinet
5 for fifteen (15) cumulative months out of forty-eight (48) months preceding
6 the filing of the petition to terminate parental rights; or
7 (k) That the child has been removed from the biological or legal parents more
8 than two (2) times in a twenty-four (24) month period by the cabinet or a
9 court.
10 (3) In determining the best interest of the child and the existence of a ground for
11 termination, the Circuit Court shall consider the following factors:
12 (a) Mental illness as defined by KRS 202A.011(9), or an intellectual disability as
13 defined by KRS 202B.010(9) of the parent as certified by a qualified mental
14 health professional, or a disability as defined in Section 1 of this Act, if the
15 mental illness, intellectual disability, or disability[which] renders the parent
16 consistently unable to care for the immediate and ongoing physical or
17 psychological needs of the child for extended periods of time;
18 (b) Acts of abuse or neglect as defined in KRS 600.020(1) toward any child in the
19 family;
20 (c) If the child has been placed with the cabinet, whether the cabinet has, prior to
21 the filing of the petition:
22 1. Made reasonable efforts as defined in KRS 620.020 to reunite the child
23 with the parents unless one or more of the circumstances enumerated in
24 KRS 610.127 for not requiring reasonable efforts have been
25 substantiated in a written finding by the District Court; or
26 2. Provided a parent with a disability as defined in Section 1 of this Act
27 with targeted adaptive and supportive services based on an individual
Page 15 of 16
BR032700.100 - 327 - XXXX 2/13/2025 2:52 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 327
1 assessment of the parent, or has received a written acknowledgement
2 from the parent knowingly and affirmatively rejecting the offered
3 services;
4 (d) The efforts and adjustments the parent has made in his or her circumstances,
5 conduct, or conditions to make it in the child's best interest to return the
6 child[him] to his or her home within a reasonable period of time, considering
7 the age of the child;
8 (e) The physical, emotional, and mental health of the child and the prospects for
9 the improvement of the child's welfare if termination is ordered; and
10 (f) The payment or the failure to pay a reasonable portion of substitute physical
11 care and maintenance if financially able to do so.
12 (4) If the child has been placed with the cabinet, the parent may present testimony
13 concerning the reunification, adaptive, or supportive services offered by the cabinet
14 and whether additional services would be likely to bring about lasting parental
15 adjustment enabling a return of the child to the parent.
16 (5) If the parent proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the child will not
17 continue to be an abused or neglected child as defined in KRS 600.020(1) if
18 returned to the parent, or if the parent proves by a preponderance of the evidence
19 that appropriate and specifically targeted adaptive or supportive services based
20 upon an individual assessment of the parent have not been offered or provided to
21 the parent, the court in its discretion may determine not to terminate parental rights.
22 (6) Upon the conclusion of proof and argument of counsel, the Circuit Court shall enter
23 findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a decision as to each parent-respondent
24 within thirty (30) days either:
25 (a) Terminating the right of the parent; or
26 (b) Dismissing the petition and stating whether the child shall be returned to the
27 parent or shall remain in the custody of the state.
