permanent custody, or adoption on the sole basis of a disability of the prospective caregiver without
considering whether targeted adaptive or supportive services could enable the prospective caregiver to
provide essential care and protection for the child.
(4)[(3)] During a certified adoptive or foster home's annual reevaluation, the Cabinet for Health and Family
Services may:
(a) Require a background investigation for each adult household member of the certified adoptive or foster

federal government, unless the applicant submits a written request for the home study to be conducted

obtaining a home study from a licensed child-placing agency approved to provide adoption services.

(5) Based on the report and recommendation of the adoption worker making the home study, the secretary shall
grant or refuse permission for the applicant to place or receive a child as early as practicable, but, in any case,
the decision shall be made within sixty (60) days after the receipt of the application. In reaching a decision, the
secretary shall be guided by the ability of the persons wishing to receive the child to give the child a suitable
home, and shall at all times consider the best interest of the child from a financial, medical, psychological, and
psychiatric standpoint.
(6) (a) If the application is refused, the secretary shall in general terms furnish in writing the reasons for his or
her refusal.
(b) If the application is refused based upon any disability of the applicant, the secretary shall confirm
that an individual assessment was conducted, and that targeted adaptive or supportive services and
modifications were reviewed and considered prior to the refusal.
(c) The cabinet shall maintain all information and supporting documentation related to the assessment,
considered targeted adaptive or supportive services and available modifications for a period of two
(2) years or as otherwise ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction.

adoption shall file a petition seeking temporary custody, with a notice of intent to adopt, with the
Circuit Court that will have jurisdiction of the adoption proceedings.
(b) The clerk of the court shall send a notice of the filing of the petition to the cabinet. A hearing on the
petition shall occur no later than seventy-two (72) hours after the filing of the petition, excluding
weekends and holidays. Proceedings under this subsection shall be incorporated into the court's

(c) If the adoption is not finalized within six (6) months of the filing of the petition and notice of intent, the
court shall conduct a hearing on the status and custody of the child.
(8) (a) Upon a finding by the Circuit Court that the child should be placed prior to the secretary's ruling on the
application, the Circuit Court may grant the applicant temporary custody of the child pending the
decision of the secretary.
(b) Temporary custody shall not be granted to an applicant unless a background check, including but not
limited to a criminal records check by the Justice and Public Safety Cabinet or the Administrative
Office of the Courts and a background check of child abuse and neglect records maintained by the
cabinet, has been submitted to and reviewed by the court. The background check required for temporary
custody shall be part of the home study required under subsection (2) of this section.
(c) If the application is denied by the secretary, the temporary custody order shall be set aside and, upon
motion of the cabinet or of the child's parent or parents, the Circuit Court may order the child returned
to the biological parent or parents or the child's custody may be awarded to the cabinet, another licensed
child-placing agency, or other individuals deemed appropriate by the court.

CHAPTER 26 5
(d) This section shall not be deemed to permit the completion of any adoption proceeding without the
approval of the secretary and compliance with KRS 615.030, if required.
(9) (a) In any case where the cabinet refuses to approve the placement of a child for adoption when requested
by the parent or parents of the child, or refuses the request of any person or persons that a child be
placed with that person or those persons for adoption, the decision of the secretary in so refusing shall
be final unless within ten (10) days after notice of refusal, the biological or proposed adopting parent or
parents shall appeal to the Circuit Court of the county in which the adoption is proposed.
(b) No placement shall be disapproved:
1. On the basis of the religious, ethnic, racial, or interfaith background of the adoptive applicant, if
the placement is made with the consent of the parent; or
2. On the sole basis of a disability of the adoptive applicant without considering whether targeted
adaptive or supportive services could enable the applicant to provide essential care and
protection for the child.
(10) (a) The cabinet may refuse to approve the placement of a child for adoption if the child's custodial parent is
unwilling for the child to be placed for adoption with the proposed adoptive family. The cabinet may
approve or deny the placement, in spite of the fact that the custodial parent or parents are unwilling to
be interviewed by the cabinet or other approving entity, or if, after diligent efforts have been made, the
adoption worker is unable to locate or interview the custodial parent or parents.
(b) The cabinet shall be made a party defendant to any[the] appeal taken under subsection (9) of this
section. In the hearing of an appeal, the court shall review the findings of the secretary and shall
determine if the secretary has acted arbitrarily, unlawfully, or in a manner that constitutes an abuse of
discretion.

home without the court's review of the background check required under this section or the permission of the
secretary for health and family services, or if permission to receive a child has been denied, a representative of
the cabinet shall notify in writing or may petition the juvenile session of District Court of the county in which
the child is found setting out the facts concerning the child. When the petition has been filed, the court shall
take jurisdiction of the child and shall provide for it as it would provide for a dependent, neglected, or abused
child under KRS Chapter 620, except that the child may not be placed in the home of the applicants who are to
receive the child unless permission to do so is granted by the secretary or the action is ordered by a Kentucky
court of competent jurisdiction.
(12) When either the custodial parent or parents of the child to be placed or the persons wishing to receive the child
reside out-of-state, the requirement of KRS 615.030, Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children, shall be
met before the cabinet gives approval for the child's placement.
(13) The secretary of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services shall be paid a nonrefundable fee of two hundred
dollars ($200) upon the filing of the written application for permission to place or receive a child. Payment
shall be made by certified or cashier's check only. All funds collected under this section shall be deposited in a
restricted account, which is hereby created, for the purpose of subsidizing an adoptive parent for suitable care
of a special-needs child as authorized in KRS 199.555.
(14) Nothing in this statute shall be construed to limit the authority of the cabinet or a child-placing institution or
agency to determine the proper disposition of a child committed to it by the juvenile session of District Court
or the Circuit Court, prior to the filing of an application to place or receive a child.
Section 5. KRS 625.050 is amended to read as follows:

shall consider the following factors:
(a) Mental illness as defined by KRS 202A.011(9), or an intellectual disability as defined by KRS
202B.010(9) of the parent as certified by a qualified mental health professional, or a disability as

neglected child as defined in KRS 600.020(1) if returned to the parent, or if the parent proves by a
preponderance of the evidence that appropriate and specifically targeted adaptive or supportive services
based upon an individual assessment of the parent have not been offered or provided to the parent, the court
in its discretion may determine not to terminate parental rights.
(6) Upon the conclusion of proof and argument of counsel, the Circuit Court shall enter findings of fact,
