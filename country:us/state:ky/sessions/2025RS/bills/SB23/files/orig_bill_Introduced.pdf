1 Assembly, to the members of the House Standing Committee on Local
2 Government and the Senate Standing Committee on State and Local
3 Government. The submission to the members shall include a note from the
4 Secretary of State stating that the members may submit any comments
5 regarding the proposed administrative regulation in accordance with the
6 deadline established in KRS 13A.270(1)(c).
7 (d) Notwithstanding KRS 13A.290(6)(a), after full review by the Administrative
8 Regulation Review Subcommittee, the Legislative Research Commission
9 shall assign the administrative regulation to the Interim Joint Committee on
10 Local Government for consideration or, if during a session of the General
11 Assembly, to the House Standing Committee on Local Government and the
12 Senate Standing Committee on State and Local Government.
13 (e) Once the standard form or forms are adopted or amended, the Secretary of
14 State shall include the form or forms, instructions, and any updates on the
15 one-stop business portal or another public website[Web site] maintained by
16 that office along with information submitted to the Secretary of State pursuant
17 to subsection (2) or (3) of this section. The form or forms and instructions
18 shall be updated and maintained by the Secretary of State at no cost to the tax
19 districts. No fee shall be levied against the public or businesses for accessing
20 and downloading forms, instructions, or other information maintained by the
21 Secretary of State under this section.
22 (2) After the form or forms are adopted under subsection (1) of this section but prior to
23 July 1, 2017, a tax district may adopt the standard form or forms as its exclusive
24 return form or forms, may accept the standard form or forms in addition to the tax
25 district's own return form or forms, or may elect to opt out of accepting the standard
26 form or forms through adoption of a written order by the tax district's governing
27 body. If a tax district elects not to accept the standard form or forms, it shall

1 forward the following information to the Secretary of State for inclusion on the one-
2 stop business portal or another public website[Web site] maintained by that office:
3 (a) A copy of the written order specifying that the tax district will not accept the
4 standard form or forms within thirty (30) days of its adoption; and
5 (b) A copy of occupational license tax forms that the tax district accepts, any
6 accompanying instructions, and any future amendments to those forms and
7 instructions within thirty (30) days of any change.
8 (3) After July 1, 2017, a tax district shall either adopt the standard form or forms as its
9 exclusive return form or forms or accept the standard form or forms in addition to
10 the tax district's own return form or forms, unless:
11 (a) The tax district submits a written request approved by the tax district's
12 governing body to the Secretary of State for an exemption based on
13 documented information that acceptance of the form will impose an undue
14 financial hardship on the tax district; and
15 (b) The Secretary of State approves the request for an exemption and obtains the
16 return form or forms that will be accepted by the tax district and any
17 applicable instructions for inclusion on the one-stop business portal or another
18 public website[Web site] maintained by that office. In exercising his or her
19 discretion to grant an exemption under this subsection, the Secretary of State
20 may impose any reasonable terms and limitations upon the exemption.
21 (4) Upon receipt of an order pursuant to subsection (2) of this section or upon the
22 issuance of an exemption under subsection (3) of this section, the Secretary of State
23 shall provide notice to the Kentucky Society of Certified Public Accountants of the
24 tax districts that have submitted a written order to opt out under subsection (2) of
25 this section or that are granted an exemption under subsection (3) of this section.
26 (5) The Secretary of State shall, only upon the request of a tax district, include
27 electronic links for the electronic filing of forms with the local tax district by no

1 later than July 1, 2017.
2 (6) Nothing in this section or KRS 67.766 shall be interpreted to alter or preempt the
3 requirements imposed by a tax district regarding deadlines, reporting, rates, or other
4 legally imposed procedures regarding the imposition, administration, and collection
5 of local occupational license taxes by a tax district. Nor shall the adoption or use of
6 a standard form or forms developed under this section release the taxpayer from any
7 liability or responsibility to the tax district for the correct payment of taxes,
8 penalties, and any other obligations imposed by the tax district. This section and
9 KRS 67.766 shall not be interpreted to authorize the collection of local tax revenues
10 by the state government or any other agency of the state.
11 Section 9. Whereas it is essential that the public and the General Assembly
12 promptly receive the necessary information to make informed decisions about
13 administrative regulations, an emergency is declared to exist, and this Act takes effect
14 upon its passage and approval by the Governor or upon its otherwise becoming a law.
