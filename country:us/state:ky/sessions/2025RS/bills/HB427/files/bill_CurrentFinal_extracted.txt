1 notify the council [on Postsecondary Education and the Kentucky Community and

5 change shall enter into discussion with the council, the other public universities,
6 and the Kentucky Community and Technical College System to verify there
7 remains a clearly defined path to transfer credits[a bachelor's degree] for those
8 students who plan to transfer from the Kentucky Community and Technical College
9 System or another public university to the public university.
10 (4) Beginning July 1, 2026, any student who transfers among public postsecondary
11 institutions shall be awarded credit by the receiving institution for courses
12 satisfactorily completed by the student at the previous institutions when the credit
13 was part of a statewide transfer pathway available at both the earning institution
14 and the receiving institution.
15 (5) Beginning July 1, 2026, participating institutions receiving transfer course credit
16 within a statewide transfer pathway shall accept and apply general education
17 courses and credit in the equivalent pathway at the receiving institution. The
18 credit shall be applied as first satisfying general education core course credit
19 requirements and program specific general education course credit requirements
20 before applying the course credit as elective credit.
