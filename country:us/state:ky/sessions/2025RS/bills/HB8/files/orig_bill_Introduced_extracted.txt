UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 249
2 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
3 Section 1. KRS 158.645 is amended to read as follows:
4 (1) The General Assembly recognizes that educating the Commonwealth's children
5 with essential knowledge and capacities is the critical goal of public education[
6 involves shared responsibilities]. The education of the children of the
7 Commonwealth requires the shared efforts of state and local government, [local
8 ]communities, parents, students, teachers, and other school employees[ must work
9 together to create an efficient public school system]. These parties need to work
10 cooperatively to provide quality educational services to all of the
11 Commonwealth's children. The public schools of the Commonwealth encompass
12 dynamic models and various delivery systems, but each is tasked with ensuring
13 every student acquires the knowledge and fundamental proficiencies, especially
14 in the core academic content areas, to become informed and productive citizens.[
15 Parents and students must assist schools with efforts to assure student attendance,
16 preparation for school, and involvement in learning. The cooperation of all involved
17 is necessary to assure that desired outcomes are achieved.]
18 (2) It is the intent of the General Assembly to create a system of public education
19 which shall allow and assist all students to acquire the following capacities:
20 (a)[(1)] Communication skills necessary to function in a complex and changing
21 civilization;
22 (b)[(2)] Knowledge to make economic, social, and political choices;
23 (c) [(3)] Core values and qualities of good character to make moral and ethical
24 decisions throughout his or her life;
25 (d) [(4)] Understanding of governmental processes as they affect the community,
26 the state, and the nation;
27 (e) [(5)] Sufficient self-knowledge and knowledge of his or her mental and

1 physical wellness;
2 (f) [(6)] Sufficient grounding in the arts to enable each student to appreciate his
3 or her cultural and historical heritage;
4 (g) [(7)] Sufficient preparation to choose and pursue his or her life's work
5 intelligently; and
6 (h) [(8)] Skills to enable him or her to compete favorably with students in other
7 states.
8 (3) (a) It is the additional and specific intent of the General Assembly to create an
9 efficient system of common schools that creates a solid educational
10 foundation upon which the Commonwealth's children can continue to build
11 and grow. To achieve this goal, the General Assembly seeks to create a
12 system of education in the lower grades based upon the following
13 principles:
14 1. The primary focus of public education during kindergarten through
15 grade five (5) shall be in the development of foundational knowledge
16 and capacities in the core academic content areas of reading and
17 language arts, mathematics, natural sciences, and social studies; and
18 2. The secondary focus of public education during kindergarten through
19 grade five (5) shall be in the enrichment areas of:
20 a. Visual, auditory, and tactile arts; and
21 b. Physical education, fitness, and an understanding of personal
22 health.
23 (b) By focusing primarily on the core academic content areas and secondarily
24 on the enrichment of students during this critical time period, public
25 education in the lower grades will provide students with the basic knowledge
26 and capacities necessary for future education and development.
27 (4) As used in this section and Section 2 of this Act:

8 Section 26. KRS 157.360 is amended to read as follows:
9 (1) (a) In determining the cost of the program to support education excellence in
10 Kentucky, the statewide guaranteed base funding level, as defined in KRS
11 157.320, shall be computed by dividing the amount appropriated for this
12 purpose by the prior year's statewide average daily attendance.
13 (b) When determining the biennial appropriations for the program, the average
14 daily attendance for each fiscal year shall include an estimate of the number
15 of students graduating early under the provisions of KRS 158.142.
16 (2) Each district shall receive an amount equal to the base funding level for each pupil
17 in average daily attendance in the district in the previous year, except a district shall
18 receive an amount equal to one-half (1/2) of the state portion of the average
19 statewide per pupil guaranteed base funding level for each student who graduated
20 early under the provisions of KRS 158.142. Each district's base funding level shall
21 be adjusted by the following factors:
22 (a) The number of at-risk students in the district. At-risk students shall be
23 identified as those approved for the free lunch program under state and federal
24 guidelines. The number of at-risk students shall be multiplied by a factor to be
25 established by the General Assembly. Funds generated under this paragraph
26 may be used to pay for:
27 1. Alternative programs for students who are at risk of dropping out of
Page 56 of 64

2 2. A hazardous duty pay supplement as determined by the local board of
3 education to the teachers who work in alternative programs with
4 students who are violent or assaultive;
5 (b) The number and types of exceptional children in the district as defined by
6 KRS 157.200. Specific weights for each category of exceptionality shall be
7 used in the calculation of the add-on factor for exceptional children; and
8 (c) Transportation costs. The per-pupil cost of transportation shall be calculated
9 as provided by KRS 157.370. Districts which contract to furnish
10 transportation to students attending nonpublic schools may adopt any payment
11 formula which ensures that no public school funds are used for the
12 transportation of nonpublic students.
13 (3) Beginning with the 2015-2016 school year and each year thereafter, the General
14 Assembly shall annually allocate funds equal to one-half (1/2) of the state portion
15 of the average statewide per pupil guaranteed base funding level for each student
16 who graduated early under the provisions of KRS 158.142 the previous school year
17 to the Kentucky Higher Education Assistance Authority for deposit in the early
18 graduation scholarship trust fund.

13 making, Class size loads for middle and secondary school classroom teachers
14 shall not exceed the equivalent of one hundred fifty (150) pupil hours per day.
15 (d)[(c)] The commissioner of education, upon approval of the Kentucky Board
16 of Education, shall adopt administrative regulations for enforcing this

18 superintendent to request an exemption from the Kentucky Board of
19 Education when unusual circumstances warrant an increased class size for an
20 individual class. A request for an exemption shall include specific reasons for
21 the increased class size with a plan for reducing the class size prior to the
22 beginning of the next school year. A district shall not receive in any one (1)
23 year exemptions for more classes than enroll twenty percent (20%) of the
24 pupils in the primary grades and grades four (4) through eight (8).
25 (e)[(d)] In all schools the commissioner of education shall enforce the special
26 education maximum class sizes set by administrative regulations adopted by

1 exemption pursuant to paragraph (d)[(c)] of this subsection. A local school
2 council may request a waiver pursuant to KRS 156.160(2). An exemption or
3 waiver shall not be granted if the increased class size will impede any
4 exceptional child from achieving his or her individual education program in
5 the least restrictive environment.
6 (6) In grades four (4) through six (6) with combined grades, the maximum class size
7 shall be the average daily attendance upon which funding is appropriated for the
8 lowest assigned grade in the class. There shall be no exceptions to the maximum
9 class size for combined classes. In combined classes other than the primary grades,
10 no ungraded students shall be placed in a combined class with graded students. In

15 that an appropriate program in the least restrictive environment for a particular child
16 with a disability includes either part-time or full-time enrollment with a private
17 school or agency within the state or a public or private agency in another state, the
18 school district shall count as average daily attendance in a public school the time
19 that the child is in attendance at the school or agency, contingent upon approval by
20 the commissioner of education.
21 (8) Pupils attending a center for child learning and study established under an
22 agreement pursuant to KRS 65.210 to 65.300 shall, for the purpose of calculating
23 average daily attendance, be considered as in attendance in the school district in
24 which the child legally resides and which is party to the agreement. For purposes of
25 subsection (1) of this section, teachers who are actually employees of the joint or
26 cooperative action shall be considered as employees of each school district which is
27 a party to the agreement.

1 (9) Program funding shall be increased when the average daily attendance in any
2 district for the first two (2) months of the current school year is greater than the
3 average daily attendance of the district for the first two (2) months of the previous
4 school year. The program funds allotted the district shall be increased by the
5 percent of increase. The average daily attendance in kindergarten is the
6 kindergarten full-time equivalent pupils in average daily attendance.
7 (10) If the average daily attendance for the current school year in any district decreases
8 by ten percent (10%) or more than the average daily attendance for the previous
9 school year, the average daily attendance for purposes of calculating program
10 funding for the next school year shall be increased by an amount equal to two-thirds
11 (2/3) of the decrease in average daily attendance. If the average daily attendance
12 remains the same or decreases in the succeeding school year, the average daily
13 attendance for purposes of calculating program funding for the following school
14 year shall be increased by an amount equal to one-third (1/3) of the decrease for the
15 first year of the decline.
16 (11) If the percentage of attendance of any school district shall have been reduced more
17 than two percent (2%) during the previous school year, the program funding
18 allotted the district for the current school year shall be increased by the difference in
19 the percentage of attendance for the two (2) years immediately prior to the current
20 school year less two percent (2%).
21 (12) (a) Instructional salaries for vocational agriculture classes shall be for twelve (12)

18 executed.
19 (13) (a) In allotting program funds for home and hospital instruction, statewide
20 guaranteed base funding, excluding the capital outlay, shall be allotted for

2 regulations to include such factors as a reasonable per hour, per child
3 allotment for teacher instructional time, with a maximum number of funded
4 hours per week, a reasonable allotment for teaching supplies and equipment,
5 and a reasonable allotment for travel expenses to and from instructional
6 assignments, but the formula shall not include an allotment for capital outlay.
7 Attendance shall be calculated pursuant to KRS 157.270 and shall be reported

17 (16) During a fiscal year, a school district may request that the Department of Education
18 recalculate its funds allocated under this section if the current year average daily
19 attendance for the twenty (20) day school month as defined in KRS 158.060(1) that
20 contains the most days within the calendar month of January exceeds the prior year
21 adjusted average daily attendance plus growth by at least one percent (1%). Any
22 adjustments in the allotments approved under this subsection shall be proportional
23 to the remaining days in the school year and subject to available funds under the
24 program to support education excellence in Kentucky.
25 (17) To calculate the state portion of the program to support education excellence in

3 year assessment or the prior year assessment increased by four percent (4%) plus
4 the value of current year new property. The calculation under this subsection shall
5 be subject to available funds.
6 (18) Notwithstanding any other statute or budget of the Commonwealth language to the
7 contrary, time missed due to shortening days for emergencies may be made up by
8 lengthening school days in the school calendar without any loss of funds under the

1 AN ACT relating to education.
2 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
3 Section 1. KRS 158.645 is amended to read as follows:
4 (1) The General Assembly recognizes that educating the Commonwealth's children
5 with essential knowledge and capacities is the critical goal of public education[
6 involves shared responsibilities]. The education of the children of the
7 Commonwealth requires the shared efforts of state and local government, [local
8 ]communities, parents, students, teachers, and other school employees[ must work
9 together to create an efficient public school system]. These parties need to work
10 cooperatively to provide quality educational services to all of the
11 Commonwealth's children. The public schools of the Commonwealth encompass
12 dynamic models and various delivery systems, but each is tasked with ensuring
13 every student acquires the knowledge and fundamental proficiencies, especially
14 in the core academic content areas, to become informed and productive citizens.[
15 Parents and students must assist schools with efforts to assure student attendance,
16 preparation for school, and involvement in learning. The cooperation of all involved
17 is necessary to assure that desired outcomes are achieved.]
18 (2) It is the intent of the General Assembly to create a system of public education
19 which shall allow and assist all students to acquire the following capacities:
20 (a)[(1)] Communication skills necessary to function in a complex and changing
21 civilization;
22 (b)[(2)] Knowledge to make economic, social, and political choices;
23 (c) [(3)] Core values and qualities of good character to make moral and ethical
24 decisions throughout his or her life;
25 (d) [(4)] Understanding of governmental processes as they affect the community,
26 the state, and the nation;
27 (e) [(5)] Sufficient self-knowledge and knowledge of his or her mental and

1 physical wellness;
2 (f) [(6)] Sufficient grounding in the arts to enable each student to appreciate his
3 or her cultural and historical heritage;
4 (g) [(7)] Sufficient preparation to choose and pursue his or her life's work
5 intelligently; and
6 (h) [(8)] Skills to enable him or her to compete favorably with students in other
7 states.
8 (3) (a) It is the additional and specific intent of the General Assembly to create an
9 efficient system of common schools that creates a solid educational
10 foundation upon which the Commonwealth's children can continue to build
11 and grow. To achieve this goal, the General Assembly seeks to create a
12 system of education in the lower grades based upon the following
13 principles:
14 1. The primary focus of public education during kindergarten through
15 grade five (5) shall be in the development of foundational knowledge
16 and capacities in the core academic content areas of reading and
17 language arts, mathematics, natural sciences, and social studies; and
18 2. The secondary focus of public education during kindergarten through
19 grade five (5) shall be in the enrichment areas of:
20 a. Visual, auditory, and tactile arts; and
21 b. Physical education, fitness, and an understanding of personal
22 health.
23 (b) By focusing primarily on the core academic content areas and secondarily
24 on the enrichment of students during this critical time period, public
25 education in the lower grades will provide students with the basic knowledge
26 and capacities necessary for future education and development.
27 (4) As used in this section and Section 2 of this Act:

9 (1) (a) In determining the cost of the program to support education excellence in
10 Kentucky, the statewide guaranteed base funding level, as defined in KRS
11 157.320, shall be computed by dividing the amount appropriated for this
12 purpose by the prior year's statewide average daily attendance.
13 (b) When determining the biennial appropriations for the program, the average
14 daily attendance for each fiscal year shall include an estimate of the number
15 of students graduating early under the provisions of KRS 158.142.
16 (2) Each district shall receive an amount equal to the base funding level for each pupil
17 in average daily attendance in the district in the previous year, except a district shall
18 receive an amount equal to one-half (1/2) of the state portion of the average
19 statewide per pupil guaranteed base funding level for each student who graduated
20 early under the provisions of KRS 158.142. Each district's base funding level shall
21 be adjusted by the following factors:
22 (a) The number of at-risk students in the district. At-risk students shall be
23 identified as those approved for the free lunch program under state and federal
24 guidelines. The number of at-risk students shall be multiplied by a factor to be

7 used in the calculation of the add-on factor for exceptional children; and
8 (c) Transportation costs. The per-pupil cost of transportation shall be calculated
9 as provided by KRS 157.370. Districts which contract to furnish
10 transportation to students attending nonpublic schools may adopt any payment
11 formula which ensures that no public school funds are used for the
12 transportation of nonpublic students.
13 (3) Beginning with the 2015-2016 school year and each year thereafter, the General
14 Assembly shall annually allocate funds equal to one-half (1/2) of the state portion
15 of the average statewide per pupil guaranteed base funding level for each student
16 who graduated early under the provisions of KRS 158.142 the previous school year

18 school district shall count as average daily attendance in a public school the time
19 that the child is in attendance at the school or agency, contingent upon approval by
20 the commissioner of education.
21 (8) Pupils attending a center for child learning and study established under an
22 agreement pursuant to KRS 65.210 to 65.300 shall, for the purpose of calculating
23 average daily attendance, be considered as in attendance in the school district in
24 which the child legally resides and which is party to the agreement. For purposes of
25 subsection (1) of this section, teachers who are actually employees of the joint or
26 cooperative action shall be considered as employees of each school district which is
27 a party to the agreement.

5 percent of increase. The average daily attendance in kindergarten is the
6 kindergarten full-time equivalent pupils in average daily attendance.
7 (10) If the average daily attendance for the current school year in any district decreases
8 by ten percent (10%) or more than the average daily attendance for the previous
9 school year, the average daily attendance for purposes of calculating program
10 funding for the next school year shall be increased by an amount equal to two-thirds
11 (2/3) of the decrease in average daily attendance. If the average daily attendance
12 remains the same or decreases in the succeeding school year, the average daily
13 attendance for purposes of calculating program funding for the following school

15 first year of the decline.
16 (11) If the percentage of attendance of any school district shall have been reduced more
17 than two percent (2%) during the previous school year, the program funding
18 allotted the district for the current school year shall be increased by the difference in
19 the percentage of attendance for the two (2) years immediately prior to the current

14 level for any pupil in average daily attendance who spends a portion of his or her
15 school day in a program at a state-operated career and technical education or
16 vocational facility.
17 (16) During a fiscal year, a school district may request that the Department of Education
18 recalculate its funds allocated under this section if the current year average daily
19 attendance for the twenty (20) day school month as defined in KRS 158.060(1) that
20 contains the most days within the calendar month of January exceeds the prior year
21 adjusted average daily attendance plus growth by at least one percent (1%). Any
22 adjustments in the allotments approved under this subsection shall be proportional
23 to the remaining days in the school year and subject to available funds under the
24 program to support education excellence in Kentucky.
25 (17) To calculate the state portion of the program to support education excellence in
26 Kentucky for a school district, the Department of Education shall subtract the local
27 effort required under KRS 157.390(5) from the calculated base funding under the

1 program to support education excellence in Kentucky, as required by this section.
2 The value of the real estate used in this calculation shall be the lesser of the current
3 year assessment or the prior year assessment increased by four percent (4%) plus
4 the value of current year new property. The calculation under this subsection shall
5 be subject to available funds.
6 (18) Notwithstanding any other statute or budget of the Commonwealth language to the
7 contrary, time missed due to shortening days for emergencies may be made up by
8 lengthening school days in the school calendar without any loss of funds under the
9 program to support education excellence in Kentucky.
10 Section 27. KRS 157.195 is amended to read as follows:
11 The General Assembly declares that all students of the Commonwealth have a right to an
12 appropriate and quality education in the public schools and the right to achieve the
13 capacities and goals under KRS 158.645. The General Assembly challenges all school
14 personnel to take the necessary action to help each individual student complete
15 elementary and secondary school with the capacities to transition successfully to adult
16 life.

20 acquire the capacities established in subsections (2)(b) and (d) of Section 1 of this
21 Act[KRS 158.645(2) and (4)]. Instruction in election procedures is consistent with
22 the goals of responsible citizenship established in KRS 158.6451.
