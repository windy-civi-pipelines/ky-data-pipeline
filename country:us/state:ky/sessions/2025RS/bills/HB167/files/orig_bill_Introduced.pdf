UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 829
1 a school council shall intentionally engage in a pattern of practice which is
2 detrimental to the successful implementation of or circumvents the intent of
3 school-based decision making to allow the professional staff members of a
4 school and parents to be involved in the decision making process in working
5 toward meeting the educational goals established in KRS 158.645 and
6 158.6451 or to make decisions in areas of policy assigned to a school council

19 neglect of duty.
20 (e) Notwithstanding paragraph (d) of this subsection and KRS 7.410(2)(c), if the
21 state board determines a violation of the nondisclosure agreement required by
22 subsection (2)(h)2.b. of this section by a school council member has occurred,
23 the state board shall remove the member from the school council, and the
24 member shall be permanently prohibited from serving on any school council

7 encourages healthy choices among students. The policy may permit physical
8 activity to be considered part of the instructional day, not to exceed thirty (30)
9 minutes per day, or one hundred and fifty (150) minutes per week. Each school

12 or principal may utilize an existing assessment program. The Kentucky Department
13 of Education shall make available a list of available resources to carry out the

15 Research Commission no later than November 1 of each year on how the schools

19 policy.
20 Section 2. KRS 158.153 is amended to read as follows:
21 (1) Unless the action is taken pursuant to KRS 158.150, no school, school

23 on information contained in a record of an adjudication of delinquency or
24 conviction of an offense received by the school pursuant to KRS 610.345 or from
25 any other source. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit a local
26 school board or school official from instituting disciplinary proceedings against any
27 student for violating the discipline policy of the school or school district or taking
Page 13 of 15
XXXX 1/8/2025 5:17 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 829
1 actions necessary to protect staff and students. Actions to protect staff and students
2 may be taken only after the principal makes a determination that the conduct of the
3 student reflected in the records of the school or obtained by the school from the
4 court indicates a substantial likelihood of an immediate and continuing threat that
5 the student will cause harm to students or staff, and that the restrictions to be
6 ordered represent the least restrictive alternative available and appropriate to
7 remedy the threat, and that the determination and supporting material be
8 documented in the child's record. The action of the principal, in addition to or in
9 lieu of any other procedure available, may be appealed by the child or the child's
10 parent or guardian to the superintendent of the school system or to the Circuit Court
11 in the county in which the school is located, and the appealing party may be
12 represented by counsel.
13 (2) Except as provided in KRS 610.345, no school, school administrator, teacher, or
14 other school employee who has custody of records received or maintained by the
15 school pursuant to KRS 610.345 or who has received information contained in or
16 relating to a record received by the school pursuant to KRS 610.345 shall disclose
17 the fact of the record's existence, or any information contained in the record or
18 received from the record to any other person, including but not limited to other
19 teachers, school employees, pupils, or parents other than the pupil, or parents of the
20 pupil who is the subject of the record.
21 (3) The child and his or her parent or guardian shall have a civil cause of action against
22 the school board and against any school administrator violating subsection (1) or (2)
23 of this section or divulging information in violation of KRS 610.345 or 610.340.
24 This civil cause of action shall be in addition to any other criminal or administrative
25 remedy provided by law.
26 (4) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a local board of education
27 from establishing districtwide standards of behavior for students who participate in
Page 14 of 15

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 829
1 extracurricular and cocurricular activities, including athletics. A school principal
2 may deny or terminate a student's eligibility to participate in extracurricular or
3 cocurricular activities if the student has violated the local district behavior standards
4 or the council's criteria for participation, as described in KRS 160.345(2)(i)9.[8.] A
5 student's right to participate in extracurricular or cocurricular activities, including
