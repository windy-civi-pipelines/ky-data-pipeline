23 on information contained in a record of an adjudication of delinquency or
24 conviction of an offense received by the school pursuant to KRS 610.345 or from
25 any other source. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit a local
26 school board or school official from instituting disciplinary proceedings against any
27 student for violating the discipline policy of the school or school district or taking
Page 13 of 15
XXXX 1/8/2025 5:17 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 829
1 actions necessary to protect staff and students. Actions to protect staff and students
2 may be taken only after the principal makes a determination that the conduct of the
3 student reflected in the records of the school or obtained by the school from the
4 court indicates a substantial likelihood of an immediate and continuing threat that
5 the student will cause harm to students or staff, and that the restrictions to be
6 ordered represent the least restrictive alternative available and appropriate to
7 remedy the threat, and that the determination and supporting material be
8 documented in the child's record. The action of the principal, in addition to or in
9 lieu of any other procedure available, may be appealed by the child or the child's
10 parent or guardian to the superintendent of the school system or to the Circuit Court
11 in the county in which the school is located, and the appealing party may be
12 represented by counsel.
13 (2) Except as provided in KRS 610.345, no school, school administrator, teacher, or
14 other school employee who has custody of records received or maintained by the
15 school pursuant to KRS 610.345 or who has received information contained in or
16 relating to a record received by the school pursuant to KRS 610.345 shall disclose
17 the fact of the record's existence, or any information contained in the record or
18 received from the record to any other person, including but not limited to other
19 teachers, school employees, pupils, or parents other than the pupil, or parents of the
20 pupil who is the subject of the record.
21 (3) The child and his or her parent or guardian shall have a civil cause of action against
22 the school board and against any school administrator violating subsection (1) or (2)
23 of this section or divulging information in violation of KRS 610.345 or 610.340.
24 This civil cause of action shall be in addition to any other criminal or administrative
25 remedy provided by law.
26 (4) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a local board of education
27 from establishing districtwide standards of behavior for students who participate in
Page 14 of 15

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 829
1 extracurricular and cocurricular activities, including athletics. A school principal

3 cocurricular activities if the student has violated the local district behavior standards
4 or the council's criteria for participation, as described in KRS 160.345(2)(i)9.[8.] A
5 student's right to participate in extracurricular or cocurricular activities, including
