2 ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY
(2) Notwithstanding any other statute or administrative regulation to the contrary, the Kentucky Board of
Education shall promulgate administrative regulations to further define a multitiered system of supports for
district-wide use of a system for students in kindergarten through grade three (3), that includes a tiered
continuum of interventions with varying levels of intensity and duration and which connects general,
compensatory, and special education programs to provide interventions implemented with fidelity to evidence-
based research and matched to individual student strengths and needs. At a minimum, evidence of
implementation shall be submitted by the district to the department by October 1 of each year and shall include
but not be limited to the activities required under KRS 158.649.
(3) The department [of Education ]shall provide technical assistance and training, if requested by a local district,
to assist in the implementation of the district-wide, multitiered system of supports as a means to identify and
assist any student experiencing difficulty in reading, writing, mathematics, or behavior and to determine
appropriate instructional modifications needed by advanced learners to make continuous progress.
(4) The technical assistance and training shall be designed to improve:
(a) The use of specific screening processes and programs to identify student strengths and needs;
(b) The use of screening data for designing instructional interventions;
(c) The use of multisensory instructional strategies and other interventions validated for effectiveness by
evidence-based research;
(d) Progress monitoring of student performance; and
(e) Accelerated, intensive, direct instruction that addresses students' individual differences, including
advanced learners, and enables students that are experiencing difficulty to catch up with typically
performing peers.
(5) (a) [By January 1, 2023, ]Each superintendent or public charter school board of directors shall select:
1. At least one (1) universal screener for reading that is determined by the department to be reliable
and valid to be administered to all students in kindergarten through grade three (3); and
2. At least one (1) reading diagnostic assessment for reading that is determined by the department
to be reliable and valid to be administered as part of a multitiered system of supports for students
in kindergarten through grade three (3).
(b) Notwithstanding KRS 158.6453(19) and 160.345, each superintendent or public charter school board
shall adopt a common comprehensive reading program that is determined by the department to be
reliable, valid, and aligned to reading and writing standards required by KRS 158.6453 and outlined in
administrative regulation promulgated by the Kentucky Board of Education for kindergarten through
grade three (3) for all schools or a subset of schools, with consultation of all affected elementary school
councils.
(c) All teachers of students in kindergarten through grade three (3), including public charter school
teachers, shall be trained on any reading diagnostic assessment and universal screener selected by the
superintendent or public charter school board prior to administration of the assessment. The training
shall address:
1. How to properly administer the reading diagnostic assessment;
2. How to interpret the results of the reading diagnostic assessment to identify students needing
interventions;
3. How to use the assessment results to design instruction and interventions;
4. The use of the assessment to monitor the progress of student performance; and
5. The use of accelerated, intensive, and direct instruction that addresses students' individual
differences and enables students to achieve proficiency in reading, including but not limited to
daily, one-on-one instruction.
(6) [Beginning with the 2023-2024 school year, ]A universal screener determined by the department[ of
Education] to be reliable and valid shall be:
(a) Given in the first forty-five (45) days of the school year for all kindergarten students at a public school
or public charter school;[ and]

CHAPTER 103 3

school or public charter school; and
(c) Given within the final fourteen (14) instructional days of the school year to all students in
kindergarten and first grade at a public school or public charter school.
(7) A reading improvement plan shall be developed and implemented by a reading improvement team for any
student in kindergarten through grade three (3) identified as needing accelerated interventions to progress
toward proficient performance in reading. The reading improvement plan shall require:
(a) Intensive intervention that includes effective instructional strategies and appropriate instructional
materials necessary to help the student make accelerated progress toward proficient performance in
reading and become ready for the next grade, including but not limited to daily, one-on-one instruction
with students the most in need provided by certified teachers specifically trained to provide one-on-one
instruction;
(b) A school to provide a written quarterly progress report containing the information required by
paragraph (a) of this subsection to a parent or guardian of any student subject to a reading improvement
plan. The written quarterly progress report for the reading improvement plan may be included in the

(c) Individual placement decisions for children who are eligible for special education and related services
to be determined by the appropriate admissions and release committee in accordance with
administrative regulations promulgated by the Kentucky Board of Education.
(8) [Beginning in the 2023-2024 school year, ]If a student's rate of progress toward proficient performance in
reading needs accelerated interventions as demonstrated by the results of an approved reading diagnostic
assessment, the local school district shall provide:

strategies;
(b) Intensive instructional services, progress monitoring measures, and supports to students through grade
three (3); and
