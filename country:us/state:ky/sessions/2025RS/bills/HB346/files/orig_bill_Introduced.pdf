4 (1) As used in this section, "emergency stationary internal combustion engine"
5 means any engine that:
6 (a) Has no time limits on use in emergency situations;
7 (b) Is operated for a maximum of one hundred (100) hours per calendar year
8 for all nonemergency situations, including maintenance checks and
9 readiness testing; and
10 (c) Is operated for a maximum of fifty (50) hours per calendar year for
11 nonemergency situations that do not constitute maintenance checks or
12 readiness testing. Hours of operation under this paragraph are counted as
13 part of the one hundred (100) hours allowed under paragraph (b) of this
14 subsection.
15 (2) The cabinet, or an air pollution control district created pursuant to KRS Chapters 77
16 and 224, may promulgate administrative regulations adopting fees for the cost of
17 administering the air quality program authorized by this chapter, as mandated under
18 the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Pub. L. No.[ (Public Law] 101-549, as
19 amended[)]. Any person who fails to pay a fee as required by the administrative
20 regulations adopted pursuant to this section shall pay an additional fee equal to fifty
21 percent (50%) of the fee amount, plus interest on the fee amount computed in
22 accordance with 26 U.S.C. sec.[Section] 6621(a)(2)[ of the Internal Revenue Code

1 in the enacted budget bill.
2 (4)[(3)] Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, the emissions fees shall
3 be assessed on each permitted source of regulated air pollutants emitted in the
4 preceding year, and the cabinet shall not create an upper limit on the amount of
5 actual emissions of a single regulated air pollutant from a permitted source
6 emitted in the preceding year that may be assessed emissions fees.
7 (5) An emergency stationary internal combustion engine unit shall not subject a
8 source that has been issued a state origin or federally enforceable non-major
9 source permit to the assessment or payment of emissions fees on any emissions
10 from that source.
11 (6)[(4)] Moneys generated by a fee structure shall be deposited into a separate and
12 distinct interest-bearing account and invested in accordance with administrative
13 regulations promulgated by the State Investment Commission pursuant to KRS
14 42.525. Moneys not expended at the end of a fiscal year shall be carried forward to
15 the next fiscal year. Any available balance shall be credited against the emissions
16 fee required in the succeeding fiscal year, and shall be credited to each source
17 according to the proportion of the total of all emission fees which were paid by that
18 source in a timely manner.
19 Section 2. Whereas it is necessary for the health and welfare of the citizens of
20 the Commonwealth that an air quality program established by an air pollution control
21 board or the Energy and Environment Cabinet be properly maintained and funded, an
22 emergency is declared to exist, and this Act takes effect upon its passage and approval by
23 the Governor or upon its otherwise becoming a law.
