1 AN ACT relating to statutory interpretation.
2 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
3 ïƒ¢SECTION 1. A NEW SECTION OF KRS CHAPTER 446 IS CREATED TO
4 READ AS FOLLOWS:
5 (1) (a) The title of any act of the General Assembly that contains "an
6 appropriation" or "declaring an emergency" or similar terms shall not be
7 determinative of whether the act contains an appropriation or declares an
8 emergency. Inclusion of these terms in the title of any act shall be
9 interpreted or construed solely as providing notification to members of the
10 General Assembly of the potential of a higher vote threshold requirement.
11 (b) The determination of whether an act of the General Assembly contains an
12 appropriation or declares an emergency shall be made as established by the
13 Rules of the Senate, the Rules of the House of Representatives, and
14 applicable law.
15 (2) Any section in an act of the General Assembly that sets out a justification for
16 declaring an emergency may be considered by the courts as a justification for the
17 emergency only, and shall not be considered as evidencing legislative intent
18 regarding the enactment itself.
