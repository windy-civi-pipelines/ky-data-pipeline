10 (3) "Medical emergency" means a condition that in the physician's reasonable medical
11 judgment, based upon the facts known to the physician at that time, so complicates
12 the woman's pregnancy as to necessitate the immediate performance or inducement
13 of an abortion in order to prevent the death of the pregnant woman or to avoid a
14 serious risk of the substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily
15 function of the pregnant woman that delay in the performance or inducement of the

8 attempts to perform or induce the abortion terminates or attempts to
9 terminate the pregnancy in the manner that provides the best opportunity

12 the physician at that time, that the termination of the pregnancy in that
13 manner poses a greater risk of death of the pregnant woman or a greater
14 risk of the substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily
15 function of the pregnant woman than would other available methods of
16 abortion, or the termination of the pregnancy is performed under
17 subsection (2)(c) of this section;
