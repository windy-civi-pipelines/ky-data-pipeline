1 combination of conditions, outlined in KRS 431.064 and 431.518 and
2 Section 5 of this Act shall reasonably ensure the appearance of the
3 defendant for required court appearances and the safety of the public.
4 (b) The court shall, in determining whether there are conditions of release that
5 will reasonably ensure the appearance of the defendant for required court
6 appearances and the safety of the public, consider the following:
7 1. Whether the offense involves violence, obstruction of public
8 administration under KRS Chapter 519, or interference with judicial
9 administration under KRS Chapter 524; and

19 of sentence for an offense under local, state, or federal law; and
20 c. The nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the
21 community that would be posed by the defendantâ€™s release.
22 (c) There shall be a rebuttable presumption that no condition or combination of
23 conditions of release will reasonably ensure the safety of the public if the
24 court finds by probable cause that the defendant:
25 1. Committed a violent or sexual offense while armed with a deadly
26 weapon or dangerous instrument;
27 2. Committed a violent or sexual offense and has previously been
Page 9 of 23
XXXX 12/23/2024 2:54 PM Jacketed

8 physical injury.
9 (d) After considering the information outlined in paragraph (b) of this
10 subsection and the existence, if any, of a rebuttable presumption under

12 evidence that no condition, or combination of conditions, outlined in KRS
13 431.064 and 431.518 and Section 5 of this Act shall reasonably ensure the
14 appearance of the defendant for required court appearances and the safety
15 of the public, the court shall order the defendant detained before trial. If the
16 court orders the defendant detained before trial, the court shall make
17 written findings of fact and a written statement for the reasons for the
18 detention.
19 (3) (a) At the detention hearing, if the defendant:
20 1. Poses a high risk and was detained pursuant to Section 1 of this Act;
21 2. Poses a risk of failing to appear for required court appearances;
22 3. Does not pose a danger to the public if released; and

24 the court may impose money bail in addition to any conditions outlined in
25 KRS 431.064 and 431.518 and Section 5 of this Act for the sole purpose of
26 reasonably ensuring the appearance of the defendant for required court
27 appearances. The court shall not impose money bail to ensure the
Page 10 of 23
XXXX 12/23/2024 2:54 PM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 927
1 protection or the safety of the community, to ensure that the defendant will
2 not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process, or for the
3 purpose of preventing the release of the defendant. If imposed, the amount
4 of money bail shall be set in accordance with Section 6 of this Act.
5 (b) In considering whether to impose money bail under paragraph (a) of this
6 subsection, the court may upon its own motion, or shall upon the motion of
7 the Commonwealth, conduct an inquiry into the source of the property to be
8 designated for potential forfeiture or offered as collateral to secure a bond,
9 and shall decline to accept the designation or the use as collateral of
10 property that, because of its source, will not reasonably ensure the
11 appearance of the defendant at required court appearances.
12 (4) At the detention hearing, the defendant shall:
13 (a) Have the right to be represented by counsel and, if financially unable to
14 obtain adequate representation, to have counsel appointed; and
15 (b) Be afforded an opportunity to testify. However, the defendant's testimony
16 shall not be admissible on the issue of guilt in any other judicial
17 proceedings, except for those proceedings under KRS 520.070 and 520.080,
18 in revocation hearings, in perjury proceedings, and for the purpose of
19 impeachment in any subsequent proceedings.
20 (5) After the court has determined pursuant to this section to either detain or release
21 a verified and eligible defendant prior to trial, the determination may be reviewed
22 at any time before trial by the court either upon its own motion or upon motion of
23 either party if:
24 (a) The court finds that information exists that was not known to the movant at
25 the time of the determination and that has a material bearing on the issue of
26 whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably ensure the
27 appearance of the defendant for required court appearances or the safety of
Page 11 of 23

1 the public; or
2 (b) Based on the Commonwealth's motion, the court finds probable cause that
3 the defendant has failed to comply with the conditions of release. The court
4 may either summon the defendant to appear at a hearing or issue a warrant
5 for the defendant's arrest. If a defendant is arrested pursuant to this
6 paragraph, a hearing shall be held within five (5) days of arrest.
7 (6) Nothing in this section shall be construed as modifying or limiting the verified
8 and eligible defendant's presumption of innocence.

1 combination of conditions, outlined in KRS 431.064 and 431.518 and
2 Section 5 of this Act shall reasonably ensure the appearance of the
3 defendant for required court appearances and the safety of the public.
4 (b) The court shall, in determining whether there are conditions of release that
5 will reasonably ensure the appearance of the defendant for required court
6 appearances and the safety of the public, consider the following:
7 1. Whether the offense involves violence, obstruction of public
8 administration under KRS Chapter 519, or interference with judicial

24 court finds by probable cause that the defendant:
25 1. Committed a violent or sexual offense while armed with a deadly
26 weapon or dangerous instrument;
27 2. Committed a violent or sexual offense and has previously been

13 431.064 and 431.518 and Section 5 of this Act shall reasonably ensure the
14 appearance of the defendant for required court appearances and the safety
15 of the public, the court shall order the defendant detained before trial. If the

24 the court may impose money bail in addition to any conditions outlined in
25 KRS 431.064 and 431.518 and Section 5 of this Act for the sole purpose of
26 reasonably ensuring the appearance of the defendant for required court
27 appearances. The court shall not impose money bail to ensure the

1 protection or the safety of the community, to ensure that the defendant will
2 not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process, or for the
3 purpose of preventing the release of the defendant. If imposed, the amount
4 of money bail shall be set in accordance with Section 6 of this Act.
5 (b) In considering whether to impose money bail under paragraph (a) of this
6 subsection, the court may upon its own motion, or shall upon the motion of
7 the Commonwealth, conduct an inquiry into the source of the property to be
8 designated for potential forfeiture or offered as collateral to secure a bond,
9 and shall decline to accept the designation or the use as collateral of
10 property that, because of its source, will not reasonably ensure the
11 appearance of the defendant at required court appearances.
12 (4) At the detention hearing, the defendant shall:
13 (a) Have the right to be represented by counsel and, if financially unable to
14 obtain adequate representation, to have counsel appointed; and
15 (b) Be afforded an opportunity to testify. However, the defendant's testimony
16 shall not be admissible on the issue of guilt in any other judicial
17 proceedings, except for those proceedings under KRS 520.070 and 520.080,
18 in revocation hearings, in perjury proceedings, and for the purpose of
19 impeachment in any subsequent proceedings.

21 a verified and eligible defendant prior to trial, the determination may be reviewed
22 at any time before trial by the court either upon its own motion or upon motion of
23 either party if:
24 (a) The court finds that information exists that was not known to the movant at
25 the time of the determination and that has a material bearing on the issue of
26 whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably ensure the
27 appearance of the defendant for required court appearances or the safety of

1 the public; or
2 (b) Based on the Commonwealth's motion, the court finds probable cause that
3 the defendant has failed to comply with the conditions of release. The court
4 may either summon the defendant to appear at a hearing or issue a warrant
5 for the defendant's arrest. If a defendant is arrested pursuant to this
6 paragraph, a hearing shall be held within five (5) days of arrest.
