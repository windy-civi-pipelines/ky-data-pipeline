Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
Section 1. KRS 158.6453 is amended to read as follows:
(1) As used in this section:
(a) "Accelerated learning" means an organized way of helping students meet individual academic goals by
providing direct instruction to eliminate student performance deficiencies or enable students to move
more quickly through course requirements and pursue higher level skill development;
(b) "Advanced coursework" means educational programs or opportunities designed to challenge
students with more rigorous content beyond the standard curriculum, including but not limited to
advanced placement, International Baccalaureate, and honors courses;
(c) "Constructed-response items" or "performance-based items" means individual test items that require the
student to create an answer rather than select a response and may include fill-in-the-blank, short-
answer, extended-answer, open-response, and writing-on-demand formats;
(d)[(c)] "Criterion-referenced test" means a test that is aligned with defined academic content standards
and measures an individual student's level of performance against the standards;
(e)[(d)] "End-of-course examination" means the same as defined in KRS 158.860;
(f)[(e)] "Formative assessment" means a process used by teachers and students during instruction to
adjust ongoing teaching and learning to improve students' achievement of intended instructional
outcomes. Formative assessments may include the use of commercial assessments, classroom
observations, teacher-designed classroom tests and assessments, and other processes and assignments to
gain information about individual student learning;
(g)[(f)] "Interim assessments" means assessments that are given periodically throughout the year to
provide diagnostic information and to show individual student performance against content standards;
(h)[(g)] "Summative assessment" means an assessment given at the end of the school year, semester, or
other period of time to evaluate students' performance against content standards within a unit of
instruction or a course; and
(i)[(h)] "Writing" means a purposeful act of thinking and expression that uses language to explore ideas
and communicate meaning to others. Writing is a complex, multifaceted act of communication and is
distinct from basic handwriting or penmanship.

Education shall implement a process for reviewing Kentucky's academic standards and the alignment of
corresponding assessments for possible revision or replacement to ensure alignment with transition
readiness standards necessary for global competitiveness, state career and technical education standards,
and KRS 158.196.
(b) The revisions to the content standards shall:

Section 2:
1. Focus on critical knowledge, skills, and capacities needed for success in the global economy;

Section 3:
2. Result in fewer but more in-depth standards to facilitate mastery learning;

Section 4:
3. Communicate expectations more clearly and concisely to teachers, parents, students, and
citizens;

Section 5:
4. Be based on evidence-based research;

CHAPTER 148 1
CHAPTER 148
( HB 190 )
AN ACT relating to advanced educational opportunities.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
Section 1. KRS 158.6453 is amended to read as follows:
(1) As used in this section:
(a) "Accelerated learning" means an organized way of helping students meet individual academic goals by
providing direct instruction to eliminate student performance deficiencies or enable students to move
more quickly through course requirements and pursue higher level skill development;
(b) "Advanced coursework" means educational programs or opportunities designed to challenge
students with more rigorous content beyond the standard curriculum, including but not limited to
advanced placement, International Baccalaureate, and honors courses;
(c) "Constructed-response items" or "performance-based items" means individual test items that require the
student to create an answer rather than select a response and may include fill-in-the-blank, short-
answer, extended-answer, open-response, and writing-on-demand formats;
(d)[(c)] "Criterion-referenced test" means a test that is aligned with defined academic content standards
and measures an individual student's level of performance against the standards;
(e)[(d)] "End-of-course examination" means the same as defined in KRS 158.860;
(f)[(e)] "Formative assessment" means a process used by teachers and students during instruction to
adjust ongoing teaching and learning to improve students' achievement of intended instructional
outcomes. Formative assessments may include the use of commercial assessments, classroom
observations, teacher-designed classroom tests and assessments, and other processes and assignments to
gain information about individual student learning;
(g)[(f)] "Interim assessments" means assessments that are given periodically throughout the year to
provide diagnostic information and to show individual student performance against content standards;
(h)[(g)] "Summative assessment" means an assessment given at the end of the school year, semester, or
other period of time to evaluate students' performance against content standards within a unit of
instruction or a course; and
(i)[(h)] "Writing" means a purposeful act of thinking and expression that uses language to explore ideas
and communicate meaning to others. Writing is a complex, multifaceted act of communication and is
distinct from basic handwriting or penmanship.
(2) (a) Beginning in fiscal year 2017-2018, and every six (6) years thereafter, the Kentucky Department of
Education shall implement a process for reviewing Kentucky's academic standards and the alignment of
corresponding assessments for possible revision or replacement to ensure alignment with transition
readiness standards necessary for global competitiveness, state career and technical education standards,
and KRS 158.196.
(b) The revisions to the content standards shall:
1. Focus on critical knowledge, skills, and capacities needed for success in the global economy;
2. Result in fewer but more in-depth standards to facilitate mastery learning;
3. Communicate expectations more clearly and concisely to teachers, parents, students, and
citizens;
4. Be based on evidence-based research;
5. Consider international benchmarks; and
6. Ensure that the standards are aligned from elementary to high school to postsecondary education
so that students can be successful at each education level.

2 ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY
(c) 1. The department shall establish four (4) standards and assessments review committees, with each
committee composed of a minimum of six (6) Kentucky public school teachers and a minimum
of two (2) representatives from Kentucky institutions of higher education, including at least one
(1) representative from a public institution of higher education. Each committee member shall
teach in the subject area that his or her committee is assigned to review and have no prior or
current affiliation with a curriculum or assessment resources vendor.
2. One (1) of the four (4) committees shall be assigned to focus on the review of language arts and
writing academic standards and assessments, one (1) on the review of mathematics academic
standards and assessments, one (1) on the review of science academic standards and assessments,
and one (1) on the review of social studies academic standards and assessments.
(d) 1. The department shall establish twelve (12) advisory panels to advise and assist each of the four
(4) standards and assessments review committees.

(g) 1. The review process implemented under this subsection shall be an open, transparent process that
allows all Kentuckians an opportunity to participate. The department shall ensure the public's
assistance in reviewing and suggesting changes to the standards and alignment adjustments to
corresponding state assessments by establishing a website dedicated to collecting comments by
the public and educators. An independent third party, which has no prior or current affiliation
with a curriculum or assessment resources vendor, shall be selected by the department to collect

CHAPTER 148 3
and transmit the comments to the department for dissemination to the appropriate advisory panel
for review and consideration.
2. Each advisory panel shall review the standards and assessments for its assigned subject matter
