Page 3 of 47
XXXX 1/7/2025 11:09 AM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1090
1 the Speaker, and every written motion, bill, resolution or other paper, after it has been
2 read by the Clerk, shall be the property and in the possession of the House and shall not
3 be withdrawn without consent of the House. Every written motion, report or measure
4 may be committed or recommitted at the pleasure of the House.
5 Rule 8. Order of Questions. All questions, whether in Committee of the Whole
6 or in the House, when not privileged questions, shall be propounded in the order in which
7 they were moved, except that in filling blanks the smallest sum and the most remote date
8 shall be put first.
9 Rule 9. Precedence of Motions. When a question is under consideration, no
10 motion shall be in order except:
11 1. To call the House when there is no quorum present.
12 2. To fix the time to which the House shall adjourn.
13 3. To adjourn.
14 4. To take recess.
15 5. To lay on the table.
16 6. For the previous question.
17 7. To limit or extend limits of debate.
18 8. To postpone to a fixed time.
19 9. To lay on the Clerk’s desk.
20 10. To refer or commit.
21 11. To amend.
22 12. To postpone indefinitely.
23 The above several motions shall have precedence in the order in which they are
24 arranged and the first seven of them shall not be debatable.
25 A second motion to adjourn, to take a recess, to lay on the table, for the previous
26 question, to limit or extend limits of debate, to postpone to a time certain, to lay on the
27 Clerk’s desk, to refer or commit or to postpone indefinitely shall not be in order on the
Page 4 of 47
XXXX 1/7/2025 11:09 AM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1090
1 same day, upon the same question, and at the same status unless other business
2 intervenes; provided, however, that amendments may be made to the time to which it is
3 proposed to adjourn, to take a recess or to postpone to a fixed time.
4 Rule 10. Motion to Adjourn. A motion to adjourn, to take a recess, or a motion
5 to adjourn to a time certain, shall always be in order, except when a member is speaking,
6 while a vote is being taken or when the Committee on Committees is reporting; subject,
7 however, to the limitations set out in Rule 9. A motion to adjourn or a motion to adjourn
8 to a time certain shall be taken by roll call vote, unless the motion is made after the
9 House has reached adjournment in the order of business under Rule 4, in which case
10 adjournment shall be by voice vote unless a roll call is ordered by a majority of the
11 members.
12 Rule 11. Motion to Table. The adoption of the motion to table, under these rules,
13 defeats the subject matter under consideration. The reconsideration of the motion to table
14 shall require approval of a majority of the members elected.
15 Rule 12. Previous Question. The previous question may be ordered by a three-
16 fifths majority of the members elected. On the call of the roll,[ and subject to any motion
17 to limit debate,] no member shall be allowed to speak more than three[two] minutes to
18 explain a vote[, and no more than one minute if the member has already spoken on the
19 measure,] and shall not speak at all if the question is not a debatable question. The effect
20 of the previous question shall be to put an end to debate on any pending amendment; to
21 prevent the offering of additional amendments and to bring the House to an immediate
22 vote upon any amendment that has been called and is in order. Once the previous
23 question has been ordered, and any pending amendment has been voted upon, the
24 opponents of the measure shall have ten minutes, and proponents of the measure shall
25 have ten minutes,[all debate shall cease and the House shall immediately] before the
26 vote upon[on] the main question.
27 Rule 13. Motion to Set the Limits on Debate. A motion to set a time limit for
Page 5 of 47
XXXX 1/7/2025 11:09 AM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1090
1 debate on a measure,[ which may include a time limit for explanation of votes,] in excess
2 of that permitted under Rule 12, shall be in order unless the previous question shall have
3 been ordered on the measure. The time limit set for debate[ and explanation of votes]
4 under this rule shall be allotted by the Speaker evenly between the opponents of the
5 measure and the proponents of the measure. Adoption of a motion under this rule does
6 not prevent the offering of additional amendments.
7 Rule 14. Motion to Reconsider. A motion to reconsider a vote shall not be in
8 order unless made by a member who voted upon the prevailing side of the question, nor
9 shall that motion be in order unless made within two legislative days in which the House
10 is in session next after the date the vote was taken and the bill or resolution is in the
11 possession of the House; however, the motion to reconsider when coupled with the
12 additional motion to lay that motion upon the table may be made by any member. For
13 purposes of this rule, a member who is recorded as "not voting" on a proposition which
14 failed is considered to have voted on the prevailing side. Procedural motions, such as a
15 motion to lay on the table or lay on the clerk’s desk, shall not be subject to a motion to
16 reconsider.
17 Rule 15. Motion to Lay on Clerk’s Desk. The effect of the adoption of a motion
18 to lay on the Clerk’s desk under these rules is to place in charge of the Clerk the pending
19 question and everything adhering to it. A motion laid on the Clerk’s desk may be taken
20 from the desk and proceeded with at any time in the same order as when laid on the
21 Clerk’s desk.
22 Rule 16. Motion to Strike Out Enacting Clause. A motion to amend by striking
23 out the enacting words of a bill or resolution shall have precedence over a motion to
24 amend; and, if adopted, shall have the same effect as though the bill or resolution were
25 regularly voted upon and rejected.
26 Rule 17. Motion to Separate Part of a Measure. A motion to commit,
27 recommit, or postpone a part of a measure so as to separate that part of the measure from
Page 6 of 47

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1090
1 the remainder shall not be in order.
2 Rule 18. Postponement of Measure. When a measure shall have been postponed
3 indefinitely it shall not be in order again during the session.
4 Rule 19. Reading of Pending Papers. Any pending bill, resolution, motion or
5 report shall be read upon the request of any member, with the concurrence of a majority
6 of the members elected to the House, but it shall not again be read on the same day unless
7 so ordered by the House.
8 Rule 20. Nominations. In all elections a previous nomination shall be made.
9 MEMBERS
10 Rule 21. Attendance of Members. No member shall be absent from a session of
11 the House without leave from the House. For the purposes of this rule, a member shall be
12 considered present if the member is in his or her Capitol Annex office during any session
13 when remote voting is authorized pursuant to House Rule 67A or if the member is in his
14 or her automobile on the Capitol Campus during any session when alternative voting is
15 authorized pursuant to House Rule 68A.
16 Rule 22. Decorum of Members. No member shall designate another member by
17 name. All members shall treat fellow members with the utmost courtesy and respect. All
18 members’ remarks in debate shall be confined to the subject under debate, avoiding
19 personality.[ A sign, poster, or any other object, the purpose of which can be reasonably
20 construed to indicate support or opposition to any measure before the House, and which
21 is large enough to be generally visible from the chair, shall not be displayed in the House
22 Chamber, or in a member’s Capitol Annex office during any session when remote voting
23 is authorized pursuant to House Rule 67A, by any member while the House is in session.]
24 Rule 22A. Point of Personal Privilege. To be in order, a point of personal
25 privilege must relate to allegations regarding the rights, reputation, or conduct of a
26 member personally, in the member’s capacity as a representative, that, if true, would
27 incapacitate them for membership. Members who have the floor after claiming a point of
Page 7 of 47
XXXX 1/7/2025 11:09 AM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1090
1 personal privilege shall confine themselves to defending their own rights, reputations, or
2 conduct, and not those of other members. Members wishing to make general comments
3 about pending legislation, media coverage, or other matters that would be out of order if
4 raised as a point of personal privilege shall use Motions, Petitions, Communications, and
5 Announcements.
6 Rule 22B. Required Training. Each member of the House shall complete
7 workplace harassment prevention training at the beginning of each session of the General
8 Assembly.
9 Rule 23. Call to Order. If any member, in speech or otherwise, transgresses the
10 rules of order or decorum, the member shall immediately be called to order by the chair
11 and shall be seated. The Clerk shall reduce the objectionable words to writing and read
12 them to the House. After hearing a short explanation from the member called to order, or
13 upon the withdrawal of the objectionable language, the Speaker may permit the member
14 to proceed, or may compel silence upon the member until the matter is disposed of. The
15 ruling of the chair shall be subject to an appeal to the House. A member offending the
16 House shall be liable to censure.
17 Rule 24. Debate. No member may speak more than once to the same subject until
18 all members desiring to be heard have spoken, but nothing in this rule shall do away with
19 the previous question if then in effect, nor permit debate on an undebatable motion.
20 No member shall speak more than thirty minutes in the aggregate on any question
21 or measure, at the end of which period, or any portion thereof, the floor shall be returned
22 to the Speaker.
23 Rule 25. Members Shall Vote at Seats. Except when remote voting is
24 authorized pursuant to House Rule 67A or alternative voting is authorized pursuant to
25 House Rule 68A, a member shall vote only when at the member’s seat or visibly
26 approaching it.

22 resolution introduced in or reported to the House.
23 Rule 56. Readings of Bills. If a bill is reported with the expression of opinion
24 that it should not pass, a vote may then be taken on whether it shall be read at length and
25 be placed on the Calendar, if a majority of the members elected to the House shall concur
26 therein. When reported favorably by the committee, the bill shall then be given its first
27 reading at length and shall be placed by the Commission staff[Clerk] upon the Calendar

17 (3) A Standing Committee may at the time of favorably reporting any House or
18 Senate Bill, recommend that it be placed in the Consent Calendar provided:
19 (a) The primary sponsor has so requested when it is a House Bill, and
20 (b) The bill receives a "should pass" or "should pass with committee
21 amendment/substitute attached" recommendation from the committee by a unanimous
22 vote of the members present.[The Rules Committee may recommend that any House or
23 Senate Bill having been favorably reported by a Standing Committee be placed in the
24 Consent Calendar, provided the bill receives a recommendation from the Rules
25 Committee by a unanimous vote of the members present. ]
26 Any House or Senate Bill thus reported shall be first[recommended for consent
27 shall be] placed in the Consent Calendar on the day on which it is entitled to a second
Page 34 of 47
XXXX 1/7/2025 11:09 AM Jacketed

6 Calendar showing the unanimous recommendation of the members[ of the Rules
7 Committee] present[,] signed by the Chair.

14 Order bills may not be amended from the floor.
15 (7) The Commission staff[Clerk] shall attach a roll call to each bill in the Consent
16 Calendar and any member may at any time prior to passage of the Consent Orders record

18 Calendar or Consent Orders.
19 (8) Upon the call for the question on the Consent Orders, the Speaker shall
20 instruct the Commission staff[Clerk] to announce the "nay" and "pass" votes previously
21 filed on each bill in the Consent Orders. All other members present in the chamber on the
22 day and at the time the Consent Orders are called shall be considered as having voted
23 "aye" and the roll call attached to each bill shall so reflect as the final vote.
24 (9) Upon the written petition of any member objecting to the placement or
25 retention of any bill in the Consent Calendar or Consent Orders, or upon the filing of a
26 floor amendment to the bill, the bill shall cease to be so considered and shall be placed

1 when taking a yea and nay vote.
2 Any time these rules require a roll-call vote, or a yea and a nay vote of the
3 members, that vote may be taken by either a voice roll call or the electrical voting system,
4 as ordered by the Speaker.
5 The Speaker, before each roll-call vote is taken, shall instruct the Clerk to sound the
6 warning chimes installed in that part of the Capitol assigned to the use of the House.
7 During a roll call any one member, with a second, may request and be afforded a
8 delay of two minutes prior to the closing of the roll. Except when remote voting is
9 authorized pursuant to House Rule 67A or alternative voting is authorized pursuant to
10 House Rule 68A, only one such motion shall be observed during any one roll call.
11 Rule 67. Electrical Voting System. When the House is ready to vote upon any
12 question requiring a roll call, and the vote is to be taken by the electrical roll call system,
13 the Speaker shall announce:
14 "The question is on the passage of (designating the matter to be voted upon). All in
15 favor of the question shall vote ‘yea,’ and all opposed shall vote ‘nay.’ The House roll is
16 now open for voting."
17 The Speaker shall recognize any member who rises for the purpose of explaining a
18 vote. No member shall be allowed to speak more than three[two] minutes to explain a
19 vote,[ and no more than one minute if the member has already spoken on the measure,]
20 and shall not speak at all if the question is not a debatable question.[ The recognition of a
21 member for the purpose of explaining a vote and the time limit allotted by this rule for
22 explanation are subject to, and may be further limited by, a motion to set limits on
23 debate.]
24 When sufficient time has been allowed the members to vote and to explain their
25 vote, the Speaker shall announce: "Have all voted?" "Does anyone desire to change their
26 vote?" and, after sufficient pause, shall lock the roll call system and instruct the Clerk to
27 record the vote. Except when alternative voting is authorized pursuant to House Rule
Page 41 of 47
XXXX 1/7/2025 11:09 AM Jacketed

1 68A, it shall be the responsibility of each member to determine the accuracy of the
2 member’s individual vote as registered opposite the member’s name on the electrical roll
3 call board and advise the Speaker of any desired change before the roll call system is
4 locked. If alternative voting is authorized pursuant to House Rule 68A, either the member
5 or the designee of the member’s caucus that is permitted to cast votes on behalf of the
6 member may determine the accuracy of the member’s individual vote and advise the
7 Speaker of any desired change before the roll call system is locked. In the case of
8 alternative voting, the Speaker shall recognize each caucus designee that is permitted to
9 cast votes on behalf of any member for an affirmation that all member votes are
10 registered correctly before the roll call system is locked.
11 The Clerk shall immediately start the recording equipment, and when completely
12 recorded, shall present the result to the Speaker who shall announce same to the House.
13 The Clerk shall enter upon the Journal the result in the manner provided by the rules of
14 the House.
15 At the same time the vote is recorded by the electric recording equipment an
16 original and five duplicate roll call sheets shall be made showing the vote, two of which
17 duplicates shall be for use of the press, and one copy shall be furnished to the Legislative
18 Research Commission.
19 With respect to any roll call vote on a question that is not on the passage of a bill,
20 adoption of an amendment or committee substitute, concurrence or recession from a
21 Senate amendment, adoption of a conference committee or free conference committee
22 report, or override of a gubernatorial veto, the electrical voting system shall indicate that
23 the question subject of the roll call vote is procedural in nature, and the roll call vote shall
24 be described as a procedural vote on the original roll call sheet and on all duplicates.
25 Rule 67A. Remote Voting Permitted. At any time, the Speaker, or other presiding
26 officer as specified in House Rule 26, may authorize remote voting procedures for the
27 members on any matter pending before the House. At any time, a committee chair may

XXXX 1/7/2025 11:09 AM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1090
1 authorize remote voting procedures for the members of the committee on any matter
2 pending before the committee.
3 If remote voting is authorized in the House, any member physically present in their
4 Capitol Annex office may cast a vote on any matter pending before the House by
5 utilizing the Legislative Research Commission Remote Voting System to indicate the
6 member’s yea or nay vote on the matter. Any votes cast by members in person in a
7 member’s Capitol Annex office through the Legislative Research Commission Remote
8 Voting System shall be reflected on the electrical voting system.
9 Rule 67B. Vote Modification. Following the close of any vote, a member may
10 only enter a new vote or modify a previously cast vote by motion, and only if the
11 member’s vote will not change the outcome of the original vote on the measure. If the
12 member’s motion is granted, the member shall file with the Clerk the vote the member
13 wishes the Clerk to enter or modify on a form provided by the Clerk, and the Clerk shall
14 thereafter enter upon the Journal the member’s new or modified vote; provided that no
15 vote cast or modified by motion under this rule shall amend an original roll call sheet.
16 Rule 68. Voting for Others Prohibited. Except when alternative voting is
17 authorized pursuant to House Rule 68A, no member shall vote for another member, nor
18 shall any person not a member cast a vote for a member. In addition to any penalties as
19 may be prescribed by law, any member who shall vote or attempt to vote for another
20 member who is not authorized to vote for the member by House Rule 68A may be
21 punished in a manner as the House may determine. If a person not a member shall vote or
22 attempt to vote for any member, that person shall be barred from the floor of the House
23 for the remainder of the session and may be further punished in any manner as the House
24 may deem proper, in addition to the punishment as may be prescribed by law.
25 Rule 68A. Alternative Voting for Others Permitted. If any member is diagnosed
26 with COVID-19 or is under a quarantine order related to COVID-19, the Speaker, or

Page 3 of 47
XXXX 1/7/2025 11:09 AM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1090
1 the Speaker, and every written motion, bill, resolution or other paper, after it has been
2 read by the Clerk, shall be the property and in the possession of the House and shall not
3 be withdrawn without consent of the House. Every written motion, report or measure
4 may be committed or recommitted at the pleasure of the House.
5 Rule 8. Order of Questions. All questions, whether in Committee of the Whole
6 or in the House, when not privileged questions, shall be propounded in the order in which
7 they were moved, except that in filling blanks the smallest sum and the most remote date
8 shall be put first.
9 Rule 9. Precedence of Motions. When a question is under consideration, no
10 motion shall be in order except:
11 1. To call the House when there is no quorum present.
12 2. To fix the time to which the House shall adjourn.
13 3. To adjourn.
14 4. To take recess.
15 5. To lay on the table.
16 6. For the previous question.
17 7. To limit or extend limits of debate.
18 8. To postpone to a fixed time.
19 9. To lay on the Clerk’s desk.
20 10. To refer or commit.
21 11. To amend.
22 12. To postpone indefinitely.
23 The above several motions shall have precedence in the order in which they are
24 arranged and the first seven of them shall not be debatable.
25 A second motion to adjourn, to take a recess, to lay on the table, for the previous
26 question, to limit or extend limits of debate, to postpone to a time certain, to lay on the
27 Clerk’s desk, to refer or commit or to postpone indefinitely shall not be in order on the
Page 4 of 47
XXXX 1/7/2025 11:09 AM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1090
1 same day, upon the same question, and at the same status unless other business
2 intervenes; provided, however, that amendments may be made to the time to which it is
3 proposed to adjourn, to take a recess or to postpone to a fixed time.
4 Rule 10. Motion to Adjourn. A motion to adjourn, to take a recess, or a motion
5 to adjourn to a time certain, shall always be in order, except when a member is speaking,
6 while a vote is being taken or when the Committee on Committees is reporting; subject,
7 however, to the limitations set out in Rule 9. A motion to adjourn or a motion to adjourn
8 to a time certain shall be taken by roll call vote, unless the motion is made after the
9 House has reached adjournment in the order of business under Rule 4, in which case
10 adjournment shall be by voice vote unless a roll call is ordered by a majority of the
11 members.
12 Rule 11. Motion to Table. The adoption of the motion to table, under these rules,
13 defeats the subject matter under consideration. The reconsideration of the motion to table
14 shall require approval of a majority of the members elected.
15 Rule 12. Previous Question. The previous question may be ordered by a three-
16 fifths majority of the members elected. On the call of the roll,[ and subject to any motion
17 to limit debate,] no member shall be allowed to speak more than three[two] minutes to
18 explain a vote[, and no more than one minute if the member has already spoken on the
19 measure,] and shall not speak at all if the question is not a debatable question. The effect
20 of the previous question shall be to put an end to debate on any pending amendment; to
21 prevent the offering of additional amendments and to bring the House to an immediate
22 vote upon any amendment that has been called and is in order. Once the previous
23 question has been ordered, and any pending amendment has been voted upon, the
24 opponents of the measure shall have ten minutes, and proponents of the measure shall
25 have ten minutes,[all debate shall cease and the House shall immediately] before the
26 vote upon[on] the main question.
27 Rule 13. Motion to Set the Limits on Debate. A motion to set a time limit for
Page 5 of 47
XXXX 1/7/2025 11:09 AM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1090
1 debate on a measure,[ which may include a time limit for explanation of votes,] in excess
2 of that permitted under Rule 12, shall be in order unless the previous question shall have
3 been ordered on the measure. The time limit set for debate[ and explanation of votes]
4 under this rule shall be allotted by the Speaker evenly between the opponents of the
5 measure and the proponents of the measure. Adoption of a motion under this rule does
6 not prevent the offering of additional amendments.
7 Rule 14. Motion to Reconsider. A motion to reconsider a vote shall not be in
8 order unless made by a member who voted upon the prevailing side of the question, nor
9 shall that motion be in order unless made within two legislative days in which the House
10 is in session next after the date the vote was taken and the bill or resolution is in the
11 possession of the House; however, the motion to reconsider when coupled with the
12 additional motion to lay that motion upon the table may be made by any member. For
13 purposes of this rule, a member who is recorded as "not voting" on a proposition which
14 failed is considered to have voted on the prevailing side. Procedural motions, such as a
15 motion to lay on the table or lay on the clerk’s desk, shall not be subject to a motion to
16 reconsider.
17 Rule 15. Motion to Lay on Clerk’s Desk. The effect of the adoption of a motion
18 to lay on the Clerk’s desk under these rules is to place in charge of the Clerk the pending
19 question and everything adhering to it. A motion laid on the Clerk’s desk may be taken
20 from the desk and proceeded with at any time in the same order as when laid on the
21 Clerk’s desk.
22 Rule 16. Motion to Strike Out Enacting Clause. A motion to amend by striking
23 out the enacting words of a bill or resolution shall have precedence over a motion to
24 amend; and, if adopted, shall have the same effect as though the bill or resolution were
25 regularly voted upon and rejected.
26 Rule 17. Motion to Separate Part of a Measure. A motion to commit,
27 recommit, or postpone a part of a measure so as to separate that part of the measure from
Page 6 of 47

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1090
1 the remainder shall not be in order.
2 Rule 18. Postponement of Measure. When a measure shall have been postponed
3 indefinitely it shall not be in order again during the session.
4 Rule 19. Reading of Pending Papers. Any pending bill, resolution, motion or
5 report shall be read upon the request of any member, with the concurrence of a majority
6 of the members elected to the House, but it shall not again be read on the same day unless
7 so ordered by the House.
8 Rule 20. Nominations. In all elections a previous nomination shall be made.
9 MEMBERS

11 the House without leave from the House. For the purposes of this rule, a member shall be

14 or her automobile on the Capitol Campus during any session when alternative voting is
15 authorized pursuant to House Rule 68A.
16 Rule 22. Decorum of Members. No member shall designate another member by
17 name. All members shall treat fellow members with the utmost courtesy and respect. All
18 members’ remarks in debate shall be confined to the subject under debate, avoiding
19 personality.[ A sign, poster, or any other object, the purpose of which can be reasonably
20 construed to indicate support or opposition to any measure before the House, and which
21 is large enough to be generally visible from the chair, shall not be displayed in the House
22 Chamber, or in a member’s Capitol Annex office during any session when remote voting
23 is authorized pursuant to House Rule 67A, by any member while the House is in session.]
24 Rule 22A. Point of Personal Privilege. To be in order, a point of personal
25 privilege must relate to allegations regarding the rights, reputation, or conduct of a
26 member personally, in the member’s capacity as a representative, that, if true, would
27 incapacitate them for membership. Members who have the floor after claiming a point of
Page 7 of 47
XXXX 1/7/2025 11:09 AM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1090
1 personal privilege shall confine themselves to defending their own rights, reputations, or
2 conduct, and not those of other members. Members wishing to make general comments
3 about pending legislation, media coverage, or other matters that would be out of order if
4 raised as a point of personal privilege shall use Motions, Petitions, Communications, and
5 Announcements.
6 Rule 22B. Required Training. Each member of the House shall complete
7 workplace harassment prevention training at the beginning of each session of the General
8 Assembly.
9 Rule 23. Call to Order. If any member, in speech or otherwise, transgresses the
10 rules of order or decorum, the member shall immediately be called to order by the chair
11 and shall be seated. The Clerk shall reduce the objectionable words to writing and read
12 them to the House. After hearing a short explanation from the member called to order, or
13 upon the withdrawal of the objectionable language, the Speaker may permit the member
14 to proceed, or may compel silence upon the member until the matter is disposed of. The
15 ruling of the chair shall be subject to an appeal to the House. A member offending the
16 House shall be liable to censure.
17 Rule 24. Debate. No member may speak more than once to the same subject until
18 all members desiring to be heard have spoken, but nothing in this rule shall do away with
19 the previous question if then in effect, nor permit debate on an undebatable motion.
20 No member shall speak more than thirty minutes in the aggregate on any question
21 or measure, at the end of which period, or any portion thereof, the floor shall be returned
22 to the Speaker.
23 Rule 25. Members Shall Vote at Seats. Except when remote voting is
24 authorized pursuant to House Rule 67A or alternative voting is authorized pursuant to
25 House Rule 68A, a member shall vote only when at the member’s seat or visibly
26 approaching it.

19 (a) The primary sponsor has so requested when it is a House Bill, and
20 (b) The bill receives a "should pass" or "should pass with committee
21 amendment/substitute attached" recommendation from the committee by a unanimous
22 vote of the members present.[The Rules Committee may recommend that any House or

24 Consent Calendar, provided the bill receives a recommendation from the Rules
25 Committee by a unanimous vote of the members present. ]
26 Any House or Senate Bill thus reported shall be first[recommended for consent

20 adoption of an amendment or committee substitute, concurrence or recession from a
21 Senate amendment, adoption of a conference committee or free conference committee
22 report, or override of a gubernatorial veto, the electrical voting system shall indicate that
23 the question subject of the roll call vote is procedural in nature, and the roll call vote shall
24 be described as a procedural vote on the original roll call sheet and on all duplicates.

11 member’s vote will not change the outcome of the original vote on the measure. If the
12 member’s motion is granted, the member shall file with the Clerk the vote the member
13 wishes the Clerk to enter or modify on a form provided by the Clerk, and the Clerk shall
14 thereafter enter upon the Journal the member’s new or modified vote; provided that no
15 vote cast or modified by motion under this rule shall amend an original roll call sheet.
16 Rule 68. Voting for Others Prohibited. Except when alternative voting is
17 authorized pursuant to House Rule 68A, no member shall vote for another member, nor
18 shall any person not a member cast a vote for a member. In addition to any penalties as
19 may be prescribed by law, any member who shall vote or attempt to vote for another
20 member who is not authorized to vote for the member by House Rule 68A may be
21 punished in a manner as the House may determine. If a person not a member shall vote or
22 attempt to vote for any member, that person shall be barred from the floor of the House

11 be distributed unless the party interested in the distribution of the material is clearly and
12 physically identified on the material to be distributed. All this material shall conform to
13 accepted public taste, shall contain no matter appealing to prurient interest or without
14 redeeming social value, and shall uphold the dignity of the legislative process. Material
15 originating from the general public shall be delivered to the administrative offices of the

4 materials of any nature to be distributed in the House Chamber. Questions as to the
5 propriety of materials shall be referred to the Committee on Committees for resolution.

8 unclaimed after one week shall be discarded. Material which is received via e-mail or via
9 any digital storage device or media with a request for distribution electronically by LRC
10 staff shall be refused or returned to the sender. Nothing in this rule restricts the right of
11 any person to communicate directly with any member, either electronically or through the
12 United States mail.
13 RULES
14 Rule 74. Mason’s Manual. In the absence of a specific rule of the House, the
15 most recent edition of Mason’s Manual of Legislative Procedure, as adopted by the
16 National Conference of State Legislatures, shall govern the proceedings, except that in all
17 cases where general parliamentary law provides for a rule of two-thirds, it shall mean in
18 this House a majority of all members elected thereto.
19 Rule 75. Change of Rules. The rules of the House, after their adoption shall not
20 be altered, changed, amended, suspended or interrupted, unless the same be done by a
21 majority of the members elected to the House. No rule shall be suspended for the purpose
22 of any action affecting the passage of a bill or resolution carrying the force of law unless
23 the rule is suspended by a majority of the members elected to the House. Whenever a rule
24 is suspended, no measure shall be considered under suspension except the measure or
25 measures in whose favor the suspension was invoked, and only for that day.
