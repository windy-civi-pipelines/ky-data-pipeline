10 proof of the fact and amount of loss realized, and pays them within fifteen
11 (15) days after the period of accumulation.
12 (d) Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, benefits are not

17 (5)(a)2. of Section 1 of this Act.

1 (4) (a) A reparation obligor may bring an action to recover benefits which are not
2 payable, but are in fact paid, because of an intentional misrepresentation of a
3 material fact, upon which the reparation obligor relies, by the insured or by a
4 person providing an item of medical expense.
5 (b) The action may be brought only against the person providing the item of
6 medical expense, unless the insured has intentionally misrepresented the facts
7 or knows of the misrepresentation.
8 (c) An insurer may offset amounts he is entitled to recover from the insured under
9 this subsection against any basic or added reparation benefits otherwise due.
