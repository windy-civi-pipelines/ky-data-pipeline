2 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
3 Section 1. KRS 304.39-020 is amended to read as follows:
4 As used in this subtitle:
5 (1) "Added reparation benefits" mean benefits provided by optional added reparation
6 insurance.
7 (2) "Basic reparation benefits" mean benefits providing reimbursement for net loss
8 suffered through injury arising out of the operation, maintenance, or use of a motor
9 vehicle, subject, where applicable, to the limits, deductibles, exclusions,
10 disqualifications, and other conditions provided in this subtitle. The maximum
11 amount of basic reparation benefits payable for all economic loss resulting from
12 injury to any one (1) person as the result of one (1) accident shall be ten thousand
13 dollars ($10,000), regardless of the number of persons entitled to such benefits or
14 the number of providers of security obligated to pay such benefits. Basic reparation
15 benefits consist of one (1) or more of the elements defined as "loss."
16 (3) "Basic reparation insured" means:
17 (a) A person identified by name as an insured in a contract of basic reparation
18 insurance complying with this subtitle; and
19 (b) While residing in the same household with a named insured, the following
20 persons not identified by name as an insured in any other contract of basic
21 reparation insurance complying with this subtitle: a spouse or other relative of
22 a named insured; and a minor in the custody of a named insured or of a
23 relative residing in the same household with the named insured if he usually
24 makes his home in the same family unit, even though he temporarily lives
25 elsewhere.
26 (4) "Injury" and "injury to person" mean bodily harm, sickness, disease, or death.
27 (5) "Loss" means accrued economic loss consisting only of medical expense, work

1 loss, replacement services loss, and, if injury causes death, survivor's economic loss
2 and survivor's replacement services loss. Noneconomic detriment is not loss.
3 However, economic loss is loss although caused by pain and suffering or physical
4 impairment.
5 (a) 1. "Medical expense" means reasonable charges incurred for reasonably
6 needed products, services, and accommodations, including those for
7 medical care, physical rehabilitation, rehabilitative occupational
8 training, licensed ambulance services, and other remedial treatment and
9 care. "Medical expense" may include non-medical remedial treatment
10 rendered in accordance with a recognized religious method of healing.
11 The term includes a total charge not in excess of one thousand dollars
12 ($1,000) per person for expenses in any way related to funeral,
13 cremation, and burial. It does not include that portion of a charge for a
14 room in a hospital, clinic, convalescent or nursing home, or any other
15 institution engaged in providing nursing care and related services, in
16 excess of a reasonable and customary charge for semi-private
17 accommodations, unless intensive care is medically required. Medical
18 expense shall include all healing arts professions licensed by the
19 Commonwealth of Kentucky.
20 2. A medical expense, other than care provided in a hospital or hospital-
21 owned outpatient facility, submitted pursuant to this subtitle shall not
22 exceed the maximum fee allowed or listed for that expense on the
23 relevant workers' compensation schedule of fees established pursuant
24 to KRS 342.035 that is in effect at the time the medical expense is
25 incurred.
26 3. There shall be a presumption that any medical expense[bill] submitted
27 in accordance with this paragraph is reasonable.

5 performed by him.
6 (c) "Replacement services loss" means expenses reasonably incurred in obtaining

14 (e) "Survivor's replacement services loss" means expenses reasonably incurred by
15 survivors after decedent's death in obtaining ordinary and necessary services
16 in lieu of those the decedent would have performed for their benefit if he had

19 loss.
