1 AN ACT relating to youth mental health protection and declaring an emergency.
2 WHEREAS, the American Psychological Association's Task Force on Appropriate
3 Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation concluded that sexual orientation and
4 gender identity change efforts can pose critical health risks to lesbian, gay, and bisexual
5 people, including depression, social withdrawal, suicidality, substance abuse, and high-
6 risk sexual behaviors; and
7 WHEREAS, the American Psychological Association issued a resolution on
8 Appropriate Affirmative Responses to Sexual Orientation Distress and Change Efforts in
9 2009, which advises parents, guardians, young people, and their families to avoid sexual
10 orientation and gender identity change efforts that portray homosexuality as a mental
11 illness or developmental disorder and to seek psychotherapy, social support, and
12 educational services that provide accurate information on sexual orientation and
13 sexuality; and
14 WHEREAS, the American Psychological Association issued a resolution in 2021
15 stating it opposes sexual orientation change efforts because there is abundant evidence of
16 former participants reporting harm resulting from their experiences of sexual orientation
17 change efforts and it opposes training supporting sexual orientation change efforts in any
18 stage of the education of psychologists and psychology; and
19 WHEREAS, the American Psychiatric Association published a position statement
20 in March 2000 in which it stated psychotherapeutic modalities to convert or "repair"
21 homosexuality are based on developmental theories whose scientific validity is
22 questionable and that anecdotal reports of "cures" are counterbalanced by anecdotal
23 claims of psychological harm; and
24 WHEREAS, the American Academy of Pediatrics in 1993 published an article in its
25 journal, Pediatrics, stating: "Therapy directed at specifically changing sexual orientation
26 is contraindicated, since it can provoke guilt and anxiety while having little or no
27 potential for achieving changes in orientation"; and

1 WHEREAS, the American Medical Association Council on Scientific Affairs
2 prepared a report in 1994 in which it stated: "Aversion therapy (a behavioral or medical
3 intervention which pairs unwanted behavior, in this case, homosexual behavior, with
4 unpleasant sensations or aversive consequences) is no longer recommended for gay men
5 and lesbians. Through psychotherapy, gay men and lesbians can become comfortable
6 with their sexual orientation and understand the societal responses to it"; and
7 WHEREAS, the National Association of Social Workers prepared a 1997 policy
8 statement in which it stated: "Sexual orientation conversion therapies assume that
9 homosexual orientation is both pathological and freely chosen. No data demonstrates that
10 reparative or conversion therapies are effective, and, in fact, they may be harmful"; and
11 WHEREAS, the American Counseling Association Governing Council issued a
12 position statement in April 1999, and in it the council states: "We oppose the promotion
13 of "reparative therapy" as a "cure" for individuals who are homosexual"; and
14 WHEREAS, the American School Counselor Association issued a position
15 statement in 2014 which states that: "It is not the role of the professional school counselor
16 to attempt to change a student’s sexual orientation or gender identity. Professional school
17 counselors do not support efforts by licensed mental health professionals to change a
18 student’s sexual orientation or gender identity as these practices have been proven
19 ineffective and harmful"; and
20 WHEREAS, the American Psychoanalytic Association issued a position statement
21 in June 2012 on attempts to change sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender
22 expression, and in it the association states: "Psychoanalytic technique does not
23 encompass purposeful attempts to "convert," "repair," change or shift an individual’s
24 sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. Such directed efforts are against
25 fundamental principles of psychoanalytic treatment and often result in substantial
26 psychological pain by reinforcing damaging internalized attitudes"; and
27 WHEREAS, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in 2012
Page 2 of 8

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 238
1 published an article in its Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent
2 Psychiatry, stating: "Clinicians should be aware that there is no evidence that sexual
3 orientation can be altered through therapy, and that attempts to do so may be harmful";
4 and
5 WHEREAS, the Pan American Health Organization, a regional office of the World
6 Health Organization, issued a statement in 2012 stating: "These supposed conversion
7 therapies constitute a violation of the ethical principles of health care and violate human
8 rights that are protected by international and regional agreements"; and
9 WHEREAS, the American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors, and
10 Therapists issued a statement in 2014 stating: "[S]ame sex orientation is not a mental
11 disorder and we oppose any "reparative" or conversion therapy that seeks to "change" or
12 "fix" a person’s sexual orientation"; and
13 WHEREAS, the American College of Physicians wrote a position paper in 2015
14 stating: "The College opposes the use of "conversion," "reorientation,' or "reparative"
15 therapy for the treatment of LGBT persons. […] Available research does not support the
16 use of reparative therapy as an effective method in the treatment of LGBT persons.
17 Evidence shows that the practice may actually cause emotional or physical harm to
18 LGBT individuals, particularly adolescents or young persons"; and
19 WHEREAS, the Trevor Project’s 2019 National Survey on LGBTQ Mental Health,
20 which surveyed over 34,000 LGBTQ youth between the ages of 13-24, found that five
21 percent of respondents reported being subjected to conversion therapy. 42 percent of
22 these LGBTQ youth who underwent conversion therapy reported a suicide attempt in the
23 past year, more than twice the rate of their LGBTQ peers who did not report undergoing
24 conversion therapy, and 57 percent of transgender and nonbinary youth who had
25 undergone conversion therapy reported a suicide attempt in the last year; and
26 WHEREAS, the Commonwealth of Kentucky has a compelling interest in
27 protecting the physical and psychological well-being of minors and vulnerable adults,
