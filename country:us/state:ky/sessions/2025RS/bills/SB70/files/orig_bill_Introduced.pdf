2 (1) (a) As used in this subsection:
3 1. "Ownership interest in a closely held farm corporation or partnership"
4 means any interest in a farm with one (1) or more of the shareholders or
5 partners owning twenty percent (20%) or more of the corporation or
6 partnership.
7 2. "Farm" means a tract of at least five (5) contiguous acres used for the
8 production of agricultural or horticultural crops including, but not
9 limited to, livestock, livestock products, poultry, poultry products, grain,
10 hay, pastures, soybeans, tobacco, timber, orchard fruits, vegetables,
11 flowers, or ornamental plants, including provision for dwellings for
12 persons and their families who are engaged in the above agricultural use
13 on the tract, but not including residential building development for sale
14 or lease to the public.
15 (b) A person desiring a division of land held jointly with others, a person desiring
16 an allotment of dower or curtesy, or a person with an ownership interest of
17 twenty percent (20%) or more in a closely held farm corporation or
18 partnership may file in the Circuit Court of the county in which the land or the
19 greater part thereof lies a petition containing a description of the land, a
20 statement of the names of those having an interest in it, and the amount of
21 such interest, with a prayer for the division or allotment; and, thereupon, all
22 persons interested in the property who have not united in the petition shall be
23 summoned to answer not more than twenty (20) days after service of the
24 summons. The written evidences of the title to the land, or copies thereof, if
25 there be any, must be filed with the petition.
26 (2) The statutory guardian of an infant or guardian or conservator of a person adjudged
27 mentally disabled may file or unite in the petition, in the names of, and in
Page 21 of 25
XXXX 1/2/2025 9:57 AM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 39
1 conjunction with such infant or mentally disabled person; and, if the petition be
2 against an infant or mentally disabled person the guardian or conservator may
3 appear and defend for them; if they fail to do so, the court shall appoint a discreet
4 person for that purpose.
5 (3) Upon such a petition by all interested in the property, or upon the expiration of
6 twenty (20) days after the service of a summons on all who have an interest in the
7 property and have not united in the petition, the court may order the division, or
8 allotment of dower or curtesy, according to the rights of the parties, except that if
9 the court determines that the property is heirs property under the Uniform
10 Partition of Heirs Property Act, then the partition or sale shall comply with
11 Sections 1 to 13 of this Act.
12 (4) The court shall appoint three (3) competent persons as commissioners to determine
13 the division or allotment of land, having a due regard for the rights of all parties
14 interested. Before proceeding to act, the commissioners shall take an oath to
15 discharge their duty impartially.
16 (5) The order of appointment shall fix a time and place for the meeting of the
17 commissioners who shall meet accordingly; but, if prevented from meeting at the
18 time and place so fixed, they may meet as soon thereafter as convenient, and may
19 adjourn to such other time and place as they may agree upon, until their duty shall
20 be performed.
21 (6) The commissioners shall equitably determine the allotment to the parties of their
22 respective interests in the land. A registered land surveyor shall perform the actual
23 survey of the land in accordance with the determination made by the
24 commissioners, and prepare the descriptions of the land, including all related maps,
25 plats, and documents, and he or she shall affix thereto his or her personal seal and
26 signature, unless such actual survey and the resultant description, maps, plats, and
27 documents pertaining to this land are already in existence. The commissioners shall

2 report to the commissioners for correction.
3 (7) If the report be confirmed, a commissioner to be appointed for the purpose shall, by
4 deed, convey to each party the land allotted to him.
5 (8) If the report be confirmed by the Circuit Court, it, together with said surveyor's
6 descriptions, survey and all related documents, and the applicable deeds shall be
7 certified by the clerk of that court to the county clerk, for record.
8 (9) Two (2) of the commissioners may act, if one (1) refuses or fails to do so.
9 (10) A party summoned may, by answer, controvert the allegations of the petition or
10 contest the rights claimed therein; and, thereupon, the case shall be tried and
11 decided as an ordinary action, but without the intervention of a jury.
12 (11) The costs of the action shall be apportioned among the parties in the ratio of their
13 interests, except that the costs arising from a contest of fact or law shall be adjudged
14 against the unsuccessful party.
15 (12) No verification of the pleadings shall be required.
16 (13) The commissioners and the land surveyor shall be paid a reasonable compensation,
17 to be taxed as costs.
18 (14) This section shall not affect the jurisdiction of courts of equity to make partition or
19 allot dower or curtesy.
20 Section 18. KRS 389A.030 is amended to read as follows:
21 (1) (a) When two (2) or more persons other than tenants by the entirety in residential
22 property actually occupied by them as a principal residence share title to real
23 estate in such manner that a conveyance by them jointly would pass a fee
24 simple title, any one (1) or more of them may bring an action for the sale or
25 division thereof in the Circuit Court of the county in which the land, or the
26 greater part thereof, lies, making parties defendant those owners who have not
27 joined as plaintiffs. A fiduciary possessing a power of sale may institute such
Page 23 of 25
XXXX 1/2/2025 9:57 AM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 39
1 an action against owners of interests not represented by him. Defendant
2 owners shall be brought before the court in the manner provided by the civil
3 rules whether or not a fiduciary possesses a power of sale of the defendant's
4 interest, but any fiduciary possessing such a power shall also be made a
5 defendant. The case shall be tried without a jury.
6 (b) This subsection shall not apply to property that the court determines is heirs
7 property under the Uniform Partition of Heirs Property Act. If the property
8 is heirs property, then the partition or sale shall comply with Sections 1 to
9 13 of this Act.
10 (2) A defendant who is under disability and for whom no fiduciary is acting shall be
11 represented in the action by a guardian ad litem, but in the event of sale of such
12 defendant's interest the court shall retain control of the proceeds of such interest
13 until a duly appointed and adequately bonded fiduciary or custodian pursuant to a
14 court order makes claim to the funds.
15 (3) In all such actions indivisibility of the real estate shall be presumed unless an issue
16 in respect thereto is raised by the pleading of any party, and if the court is satisfied
17 from the evidence that the property is divisible, without materially impairing the
18 value of any interest therein, division thereof pursuant to KRS 381.135 shall be
19 ordered.
20 (4) If a sale of all or any part of the real estate shall be ordered, the court shall refer the
21 matter to the master commissioner or appoint a commissioner to conduct a public
22 sale and convey the property upon terms of sale and disposition of the net proceeds
23 as may have been determined by the court.
24 (5) The death of any party pending the action and prior to distribution of the proceeds
25 of sale or setting apart a divisible share shall not affect the action but the court may
26 direct distribution or apportionment to the successors in interest of the decedent
27 upon application therefor.

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 39
1 (6) If the interest of any party be one for life, or other term, in any portion of the real
2 estate, the court shall determine the value of such interest and direct that such party
3 receive a portion of the net sale proceeds or portion of the property if divisible, in
4 fee in satisfaction of such interest, but if any party to the action objects to such
5 procedure, and if the court finds that such procedure would defeat the objects and
6 purpose of a person not a party to the action, such as a testator, grantor or settlor,
7 but that sale or division is nevertheless desirable, the court shall order that the
8 interest of the life or term tenant shall continue as to his or her portion of the real
9 estate or the net proceeds of the sale thereof, in the latter case by directing that the
10 funds derived from the sale of that portion of the real estate in which the life or term
11 interest existed be paid to a trustee, appointed by and accountable to the District
12 Court, for reinvestment and distribution of income and principal in a manner
13 consistent with the instrument under which the life or term estate was created.
