5 pay for the cure and relief from the effects of an injury or occupational disease the
6 medical, surgical, and hospital treatment, including nursing, medical, and surgical
7 supplies and appliances, as may reasonably be required at the time of the injury and
8 thereafter for the length of time set forth in this section, or as may be required for
9 the cure and treatment of an occupational disease.
10 (2) In claims resulting in an award of permanent total disability or resulting from an
11 injury described in subsection (9) of this section, the employer's obligation to pay
12 the benefits specified in this section shall continue for so long as the employee is
13 disabled regardless of the duration of the employee's income benefits.
14 (3) (a) In all permanent partial disability claims not involving an injury described in
15 subsection (9) of this section, the employer's obligation to pay the benefits
16 specified in this section shall continue for seven hundred eighty (780) weeks

22 hundred fifty-four (754) weeks from the date of injury or last exposure.
23 (c) An employee shall receive a continuation of benefits as described in this
24 section for additional time beyond the period provided in paragraph (a) of this
25 subsection as long as continued medical treatment is reasonably necessary and
26 related to the work injury or occupational disease if:

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1618
1 termination of the seven hundred eighty (780) week period;
2 2. The employee demonstrates that continued medical treatment is
3 reasonably necessary and related to the work injury or occupational
4 disease; and
5 3. An administrative law judge determines and orders that continued
6 benefits are reasonably necessary and related to the work injury or
7 occupational disease for additional time beyond the original seven
8 hundred eighty (780) week period provided in paragraph (a) of this
9 subsection.
10 (d) If the administrative law judge determines that medical benefits are not
11 reasonably necessary or not related to the work injury or occupational disease,

13 within the time period provided in paragraph (c) of this subsection, any future
14 medical treatment shall be deemed to be unrelated to the work injury and the
15 employer's obligation to pay medical benefits shall cease permanently.
16 (4) (a) In the absence of designation of a managed health care system by the
17 employer, the employee may select medical providers to treat his injury or

4 employer, insurer, or payment obligor that the claim has been determined to
5 compensable, or an administrative law judge makes an initial determination
6 of compensability, whichever occurs first, the provider of medical services
7 shall submit the statement for services within forty-five (45) days of the day
8 treatment is initiated and every forty-five (45) days thereafter, if appropriate,
9 as long as medical services are rendered.
10 (d) To be effective under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this subsection, notice
11 regarding compensability of a claim shall provide the injured worker and
12 the medical provider with all necessary information about the manner in
13 which a statement for services is to be submitted.

12 managed health care system, at the employer's expense, when treatment is
13 unavailable through the managed health care system;

12 artificial member and, where required, proper braces as may reasonably be required
13 at the time of the injury and thereafter during disability.
14 (10) Upon motion of the employer, with sufficient notice to the employee for a response
15 to be filed, if it is shown to the satisfaction of the administrative law judge by
16 affidavits or testimony that, because of the physician selected by the employee to
17 treat the injury or disease, or because of the hospital selected by the employee in
18 which treatment is being rendered, that the employee is not receiving proper
19 medical treatment and the recovery is being substantially affected or delayed; or
20 that the funds for medical expenses are being spent without reasonable benefit to
21 the employee; or that because of the physician selected by the employee or because
22 of the type of medical treatment being received by the employee that the employer
23 will substantially be prejudiced in any compensation proceedings resulting from the
24 employee's injury or disease; then the administrative law judge may allow the

10 by the employee, employer, workers' compensation insurer, special fund, uninsured
11 employers' fund, or the administrative law judge, provide the requesting party with
12 any information or written material reasonably related to any injury or disease for
13 which the employee claims compensation.
14 (12) When a provider of medical services or treatment, required by this chapter, makes
15 referrals for medical services or treatment by this chapter, to a provider or entity in
16 which the provider making the referral has an investment interest, the referring
17 provider shall disclose that investment interest to the employee, the commissioner,

5 pay for the cure and relief from the effects of an injury or occupational disease the
6 medical, surgical, and hospital treatment, including nursing, medical, and surgical
7 supplies and appliances, as may reasonably be required at the time of the injury and
8 thereafter for the length of time set forth in this section, or as may be required for
9 the cure and treatment of an occupational disease.
10 (2) In claims resulting in an award of permanent total disability or resulting from an

12 the benefits specified in this section shall continue for so long as the employee is
13 disabled regardless of the duration of the employee's income benefits.
14 (3) (a) In all permanent partial disability claims not involving an injury described in

22 hundred fifty-four (754) weeks from the date of injury or last exposure.
23 (c) An employee shall receive a continuation of benefits as described in this
24 section for additional time beyond the period provided in paragraph (a) of this
25 subsection as long as continued medical treatment is reasonably necessary and

6 benefits are reasonably necessary and related to the work injury or

8 treatment is initiated and every forty-five (45) days thereafter, if appropriate,
9 as long as medical services are rendered.

11 regarding compensability of a claim shall provide the injured worker and
