3 may be admissible in a prosecution under subsection (1)(b) or (e) of this
4 section; or
5 (b) If the sample of the person's blood that is used to determine the presence of a

24 defendant.
25 The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed as limiting the introduction
26 of any other competent evidence bearing upon the questions of whether the
27 defendant was under the influence of alcohol or other substances, in any

7 evidence in a prosecution under subsection (1)(d) of this section upon a
8 finding by the court that the defendant consumed the substance under a valid
9 prescription from a practitioner, as defined in KRS 218A.010, acting in the
