18 that the defendant was not under the influence of alcohol; and

24 defendant.
25 The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed as limiting the introduction
26 of any other competent evidence bearing upon the questions of whether the
27 defendant was under the influence of alcohol or other substances, in any

8 finding by the court that the defendant consumed the substance under a valid
9 prescription from a practitioner, as defined in KRS 218A.010, acting in the

2 requiring a blood or urine test, or a combination thereof, of a defendant
3 charged with a violation of KRS 189A.010, or other statutory violation arising
4 from the incident. However, if the incident involves a motor vehicle accident
5 in which there was a fatality, the investigating peace officer shall seek such a
6 search warrant for blood testing unless the testing has already been done by
7 consent. If testing done pursuant to a warrant reveals the presence of alcohol
8 or any other substance that impaired the driving ability of a person who is
9 charged and convicted of a violation of KRS 189A.010(1), the sentencing
10 court shall require, in addition to any other sentencing provision, that the
11 defendant make restitution to the state for the cost of the testing.
12 (c) 1. When directed by a peace officer pursuant to a search warrant or other
13 court order issued under this subsection, a qualified medical professional
14 shall withdraw the sample of blood as soon as practicable and shall
15 deliver the sample to the requesting peace officer, or other peace officer
16 as directed by the requesting peace officer, provided that the collection
17 of the sample does not jeopardize the person's life, cause serious injury
18 to the person, or seriously impede the person's medical assessment, care,
19 or treatment.
20 2. The qualified medical professional authorized to withdraw the blood
21 sample and the medical care facility where the blood sample is drawn
22 shall be considered as acting in good faith once presented with a search
23 warrant or other court order issued under this subsection. The qualified
24 medical professional shall not require the person that is the subject of
25 the test or tests to provide any additional consent.
26 3. A qualified medical professional who administers any test under this
27 paragraph upon the request of a peace officer, and a medical care facility

1 where any test under this paragraph may be performed, shall not be
2 criminally liable solely for administering the requested test or civilly
3 liable for damages to the person tested solely for administering the
4 requested test except in cases of gross negligence or willful or wanton
5 misconduct.
6 (3) During the period immediately preceding the administration of any test, the person
7 shall be afforded an opportunity of at least ten (10) minutes but not more than
8 fifteen (15) minutes to attempt to contact and communicate with an attorney and
9 shall be informed of this right. Inability to communicate with an attorney during
10 this period shall not be deemed to relieve the person of his or her obligation to
11 submit to the tests and the penalties specified by KRS 189A.010 and 189A.107
12 shall remain applicable to the person upon refusal. Nothing in this section shall be
13 deemed to create a right to have an attorney present during the administration of the
14 tests, but the person's attorney may be present if the attorney can physically appear
15 at the location where the test is to be administered within the time period
16 established in this section.
17 (4) Immediately following the administration of the final test requested by the officer,
18 the person shall again be informed of his or her right to have a test or tests of his or
19 her blood performed by a person of his or her choosing described in KRS 189A.103
20 within a reasonable time of his or her arrest at the expense of the person arrested.
21 He or she shall then be asked "Do you want such a test?" The officer shall make
22 reasonable efforts to provide transportation to the tests.
23 ïƒ¢Section 4. KRS 189A.340 is amended to read as follows:
24 (1) (a) If a person's license is suspended pursuant to this chapter and the initial
