2 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
3 Section 1. KRS 278.704 is amended to read as follows:
4 (1) No person shall commence to construct a merchant electric generating facility until
5 that person has applied for and obtained a construction certificate for the facility
6 from the board. The construction certificate shall be valid for a period of three (3)
7 years after the issuance date of the last permit required to be obtained from the
8 Energy and Environment Cabinet after which the certificate shall be void. The
9 certificate shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining necessary air, water,
10 and waste permits. If an applicant has not obtained all necessary permits and has
11 not commenced to construct prior to the expiration date of the certificate, the
12 applicant shall be required to obtain a new valid certificate from the board.
13 (2) Except as provided in subsections (3), (4), and (5) of this section, no construction
14 certificate shall be issued to construct a merchant electric generating facility unless
15 the exhaust stack of the proposed facility and any wind turbine is at least one
16 thousand (1,000) feet from the property boundary of any adjoining property owner
17 and all proposed structures or facilities used for generation of electricity are two
18 thousand (2,000) feet from any residential neighborhood, school, hospital, or
19 nursing home facility. For purposes of applications for site compatibility certificates
20 pursuant to KRS 278.216, only the exhaust stack of the proposed facility to be
21 actually used for coal or gas-fired generation or, beginning with applications for site
22 compatibility certificates filed on or after January 1, 2015, the proposed structure or
23 facility to be actually used for solar or wind generation shall be required to be at
24 least one thousand (1,000) feet from the property boundary of any adjoining
