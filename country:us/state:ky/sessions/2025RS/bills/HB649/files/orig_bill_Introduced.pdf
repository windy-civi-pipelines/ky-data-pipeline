1 (3) The clothing exemption provided in subsection (2)(a) of this section shall not
2 include:
3 (a) Clothing accessories or equipment;
4 (b) Protective equipment; or

6 (4) The exemption provided in this section shall be subject to the following
7 provisions:
8 (a) The sale of eligible property shall qualify for exemption if:
9 1. The property is both delivered to and paid for by the purchaser during
10 the sales tax holiday exemption period; or
11 2. The purchaser orders and pays for the eligible property, and the seller
12 accepts the order, during the sales tax holiday for immediate
13 shipment, even if delivery is made after the sales tax holiday. The
14 seller accepts the order when the seller has taken action to fill the
15 order for immediate shipment. Actions to fill an order include
16 placement of an "in date" stamp on a mail order or assignment of an
17 "order number" to an order submitted by telephone or electronically.
18 An order is for immediate shipment when the customer does not
19 request delayed shipment. An order is for immediate shipment,
20 notwithstanding that the shipment may be delayed because of a
21 backlog of orders or because stock is currently unavailable to, or on
22 back order by, the seller;
23 (b) A sale of eligible property under a layaway sale qualifies for exemption
24 under this section if:

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1784
1 order for the property, during the sales tax holiday, for immediate
2 delivery upon full payment, even if delivery is made after the sales tax
3 holiday;
4 (c) 1. A discount by the seller reduces the sales price of the property and the
5 discounted sales price determines whether the sales price is within the
6 sales tax holiday price threshold.
7 2. A coupon that reduces the sales price is treated as a discount if the
8 seller is not reimbursed for the coupon amount by a person other than
9 the purchaser.
10 3. If a discount applies to the total amount paid by a purchaser, rather
11 than to the sales price of a particular item, and the purchaser has
12 purchased both eligible property and taxable property, the seller shall
13 allocate the discount based on the total sales price of the taxable
14 property compared to the total sales price of all property sold in that
15 same transaction;
16 (d) Articles that are normally sold as a single unit shall continue to be sold in
17 that manner. Articles that are normally sold as a single unit, such as a pair
18 of shoes, shall not be priced and sold separately in order to obtain the
19 exemption;
20 (e) Eligible property purchased with the use of a rain check during the sales tax
21 holiday shall qualify for the exemption regardless of when the rain check
22 was issued. Issuance of a rain check during the sales tax holiday shall not
23 qualify the eligible property for the exemption if the property is actually
24 purchased after the sales tax holiday;
25 (f) The procedure for an exchange of eligible property shall be as follows:
26 1. If an item of eligible property is purchased during the sales tax
27 holiday, but the purchaser later exchanges the item for similar eligible
Page 8 of 10

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1784
1 property, even if a different size, different color, or other feature, no
2 additional tax is due, even if the exchange is made after the sales tax
3 holiday;
4 2. If an item of eligible property is purchased during the sales tax
5 holiday, but the purchaser returns the item and receives credit on the
6 purchase of a different item, the appropriate sales tax is due on the
7 sale of the newly purchased item if not otherwise exempt under this
8 chapter; and
9 3. If an item of eligible property is purchased during the sales tax
10 holiday, but during the sales tax holiday the purchaser returns the
11 item and receives credit on the purchase of a different item of eligible
12 property, no sales tax is due on the sale of the new item if the new item
13 is purchased during the sales tax holiday;
14 (g) Delivery charges as defined in KRS 139.010 shall be included in the sales
15 price of eligible property. For purposes of determining a sales tax holiday
16 price threshold, if all property in a shipment is eligible property and within
17 the sales tax holiday price threshold, then the seller is not required to
18 allocate the delivery charges to determine whether the price threshold is
19 exceeded, and the shipment shall be considered a sale of eligible property. If
20 a shipment includes eligible property and taxable property, including
21 eligible property with a sales price in excess of the price threshold, the seller
22 shall allocate the delivery charges by using:
23 1. A percentage based on the total sales price of the taxable property
24 compared to the total sales price of all property in the shipment; or
25 2. A percentage based on the total weight of the taxable property
26 compared to the total weight of all property in the shipment. The seller
27 shall tax the percentage of the delivery charge allocated to the taxable

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1784
1 property, but the seller is not required to tax the percentage allocated
2 to the eligible property;
3 (h) 1. If, within sixty (60) days immediately following the sales tax holiday, a
4 purchaser returns an item to the seller that would have qualified as
5 exempt eligible property if purchased during the sales tax holiday, the
6 seller may issue a credit or refund of the tax paid only if:
7 a. The purchaser provides to the seller a receipt or invoice
8 indicating that the tax was paid; or
9 b. The seller has sufficient documentation that indicates that sales
10 tax was paid on the specific returned item.
11 2. The sixty (60) day time period is not intended to change a seller's
12 policy on the time period during which the seller will accept returns;
13 and
14 (i) If the purchaser and the seller are located in different time zones, the time
15 zone of the seller's location determines the authorized time period
16 applicable to the sales tax holiday.
17 ïƒ¢Section 2. Whereas Kentucky is a full member state of the Streamlined Sales
18 and Use Tax Agreement, a multistate agreement providing for simplification of the
19 nation's varying sales tax laws, and whereas Kentucky is required by the agreement to
20 provide notification to both sellers and purchasers located within and without Kentucky
21 of the implementation of a sales tax holiday exemption period at least 60 days prior to the
22 first day of the calendar month in which the exemption period will begin, an emergency
23 is declared to exist, and this Act takes effect May 1, 2025.
