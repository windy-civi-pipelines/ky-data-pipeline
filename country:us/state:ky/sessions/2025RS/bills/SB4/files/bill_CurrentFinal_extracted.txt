20 the Commonwealth and it is critically important to protect candidates and election
21 officers from fraudulent misrepresentations of themselves and their issues, an emergency
22 is declared to exist, and this Act takes effect upon its passage and approval by the
23 Governor or upon its otherwise becoming a law.
