1 AN ACT relating to Women Veterans Appreciation Day and declaring an
2 emergency.
3 WHEREAS, women have proudly served their country throughout all periods of the
4 history of the United States, disguising themselves as male soldiers during the American
5 Revolution and Civil War, serving as nurses in both World Wars, flying combat
6 helicopters in Afghanistan, and serving in countless other ways; and
7 WHEREAS, women have formally been a part of the United States Armed Forces
8 since the inception of the Army Nurse Corps in 1901, but have informally served since
9 the inception of our nation's military; and
10 WHEREAS, veterans act with incredible honor and disregard personal well-being
11 to preserve a gift of unapproachable magnitude for the citizens of this great nation in
12 American freedom; and
13 WHEREAS, it was not until well after World War II that women who served in the
14 military began to be officially recognized as veterans; and
15 WHEREAS, women who have served in the United States military are often
16 referred to as "invisible veterans" because until the 1970s their service contributions went
17 largely unrecognized; and
18 WHEREAS, there are currently around 2,000,000 women veterans living in the
19 United States and Puerto Rico, and of those, over 27,000 live in the Commonwealth of
20 Kentucky; and
21 WHEREAS, Kentucky honors the tremendous sacrifices our women in uniform
22 have made in order to defend our country; and
23 WHEREAS, it is the Commonwealth's duty to honor the memory of our dedicated
24 servicewomen who never returned home, having made the ultimate sacrifice to preserve
25 our nation and its way of life; and
26 WHEREAS, the Commonwealth pays special tribute to the valiant guardians of our
27 freedom who remain listed as Missing in Action and offers support to the loving families
