21 as a precaution against possible default by failure to collect annual levies. The
22 bonds shall state on their face that they do not constitute a debt of the district but
23 are payable solely from collection of special assessments made upon benefited
24 lands lying in the watershed conservancy district.

17 when other taxes of the district are levied and shall be sufficient in each year to

19 sufficient to provide a fund equal to twenty percent (20%) of the average annual
20 principal and interest requirements, the same to constitute a "debt service reserve"
21 as a precaution against possible default by failure to collect annual levies. The
22 bonds shall state on their face that they do not constitute a debt of the district but
23 are payable solely from collection of special assessments made upon benefited
24 lands lying in the watershed conservancy district.
