be in the future modified by a court of competent jurisdiction, and the intercollegiate athletic association

institution's participation in intercollegiate athletics, the governing board of an institution may adopt a policy
governing the name, image, and likeness agreements of the institution's student-athletes. Any restrictions

student-athletes. The institution's policy shall ensure the equitable enforcement of restrictions. Reasonable
restrictions that an institution may choose to impose include but are not limited to:

manner designated by the institution. The institution shall have up to three (3) business days to review
the potential NIL agreement for conflicts with the provisions of KRS 164.6941 to 164.6951 or the
institution's reasonable restrictions and provide the student-athlete with a written notice of any conflicts

identify concerns. After any conflicts are resolved, the student-athlete may then enter into the

marketing, branding, or other NIL agreement products or services.

support to the institution's student-athletes. The mission and the extent of the program shall be established by
the governing board and may include:
(a) Providing impartial analysis of potential NIL agreements;
(b) Referring third parties soliciting potential NIL agreements to student-athletes or their athlete agents; and
(c) Maintaining educational resources on name, image, and likeness for student-athlete use.
(6) An institution's governing board may establish a program to provide NIL agreement resources as it relates to
student-athletes to the general public and potential third-party licensees.
(7) For the purposes of the Kentucky Open Records Act, KRS 61.870 to 61.884, a student-athlete's institutional
agreement or an NIL agreement submitted pursuant to subsection (2) of this section to a public postsecondary
institution and the information obtained from the agreement shall be considered as containing information of a

8 ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY
(3) (a) The Kentucky Board of Education is hereby authorized to lease from the State Property and Buildings
Commission or others, whether public or private, any lands, buildings, structures, installations, and
facilities suitable for use in establishing and furthering television and related facilities as an aid or
supplement to classroom instruction throughout the Commonwealth and for incidental use in any other
proper public functions. The lease may be for any initial term commencing with the date of the lease
and ending with the next ensuing June 30, which is the close of the then-current fiscal biennium of the
Commonwealth, with exclusive options in favor of the board to renew the same for successive ensuing
bienniums, July 1 in each even year to June 30 in the next ensuing even year; and the rentals may be
fixed at the sums in each biennium, if renewed, sufficient to enable the State Property and Buildings
Commission to pay therefrom the maturing principal of and interest on, and provide reserves for, any
revenue bonds which the State Property and Buildings Commission may determine to be necessary and
sufficient, in agreement with the board, to provide the cost of acquiring the television and related
facilities with appurtenances and costs as may be incident to the issuance of the bonds.
(b) Each option of the Kentucky Board of Education to renew the lease for a succeeding biennial term may
be exercised at any time after the adjournment of the session of the General Assembly at which
appropriations shall have been made for the operation of the state government for such succeeding
biennial term, by notifying the State Property and Buildings Commission in writing, signed by the chief
state school officer, and delivered to the secretary of the Finance and Administration Cabinet as a
member of the commission. The option shall be deemed automatically exercised, and the lease
automatically renewed for the succeeding biennium, effective on the first day thereof, unless a written
notice of the board's election not to renew shall have been delivered in the office of the secretary of the
Finance and Administration Cabinet before the close of business on the last working day in April
immediately preceding the beginning of the succeeding biennium.
(c) The Kentucky Board of Education shall not itself operate leased television facilities, or undertake the
preparation of the educational presentations or films to be transmitted thereby, but may enter into one
(1) or more contracts to provide therefor, with any public agency and instrumentality of the
Commonwealth having, or able to provide, a staff with proper technical qualifications, upon which
agency and instrumentality the board, through the chief state school officer and the Department of
Education, is represented in such manner as to coordinate matters of curriculum with the curricula
prescribed for the public schools of the Commonwealth. Any contract for the operation of the leased
television or related facilities may permit limited and special uses of the television or related facilities
for other programs in the public interest, subject to the reasonable terms and conditions as the board and
the operating agency and instrumentality may agree upon; but any contract shall affirmatively forbid the
use of the television or related facilities, at any time or in any manner, in the dissemination of political
propaganda or in furtherance of the interest of any political party or candidate for public office, or for
commercial advertising. No lease between the board and the State Property and Buildings Commission
shall bind the board to pay rentals for more than one (1) fiscal biennium at a time, subject to the
aforesaid renewal options. The board may receive and may apply to rental payments under any lease
and to the cost of providing for the operation of the television or related facilities not only
appropriations which may be made to it from state funds, from time to time, but also contributions,
gifts, matching funds, devises, and bequests from any source, whether federal or state, and whether
public or private, so long as the same are not conditioned upon any improper use of the television or
related facilities in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of this subsection.
(4) The state board may, on the recommendation and with the advice of the chief state school officer, prescribe,
print, publish, and distribute at public expense such administrative regulations, courses of study, curriculums,
bulletins, programs, outlines, reports, and placards as each deems necessary for the efficient management,
control, and operation of the schools and programs under its jurisdiction. All administrative regulations
published or distributed by the board shall be enclosed in a booklet or binder on which the words
"informational copy" shall be clearly stamped or printed.
(5) Upon the recommendation of the chief state school officer or his or her designee, the state board shall establish
policy or act on all matters relating to programs, services, publications, capital construction and facility
renovation, equipment, litigation, contracts, budgets, and all other matters which are the administrative
responsibility of the Department of Education.
Section 8. Whereas the mission and successful operation of the state's postsecondary educational
institutions requires clear guidelines for the regulation of student-athlete compensation in intercollegiate athletics, an
emergency is declared to exist, and this Act take effect upon its passage and approval by the Governor or upon its
otherwise becoming a law.
