(1) Anyone acting upon reasonable cause in the making of a report or acting under KRS 620.030 to 620.050 in
good faith shall have immunity from any liability, civil or criminal, that might otherwise be incurred or
imposed. Any such participant shall have the same immunity with respect to participation in any judicial
proceeding resulting from such report or action. However, any person who knowingly makes a false report and
does so with malice shall be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor.
(2) Any employee or designated agent of a children's advocacy center shall be immune from any civil liability
arising from performance within the scope of the person's duties as provided in KRS 620.030 to 620.050. Any
such person shall have the same immunity with respect to participation in any judicial proceeding. Nothing in
this subsection shall limit liability for negligence. Upon the request of an employee or designated agent of a
children's advocacy center, the Attorney General shall provide for the defense of any civil action brought
against the employee or designated agent as provided under KRS 12.211 to 12.215.
(3) Neither the husband-wife nor any professional-client/patient privilege, except the attorney-client and clergy-

from a report pursuant to this section. This subsection shall also apply in any criminal proceeding in District or
Circuit Court regarding a dependent, neglected, or abused child.
(4) Upon receipt of a report of an abused, neglected, or dependent child pursuant to this chapter, the cabinet as the
designated agency or its delegated representative shall initiate a prompt investigation or assessment of family
needs, take necessary action, and shall offer protective services toward safeguarding the welfare of the child.
The cabinet shall work toward preventing further dependency, neglect, or abuse of the child or any other child
under the same care, and preserve and strengthen family life, where possible, by enhancing parental capacity
for adequate child care. If an oral or written report, including but not limited to electronic submissions,
alleging that a child is dependent, neglected, or abused is made pursuant to this section, and the cabinet
determines that the report does not meet criteria for an investigation, the cabinet shall refer the family to
appropriate community-based child and family service agencies for services to preserve and strengthen family
life in accordance with the requirements in 42 U.S.C. sec. 5106a.
(5) The report of suspected child abuse, neglect, or dependency and all information obtained by the cabinet or its
delegated representative, as a result of an investigation or assessment made pursuant to this chapter, except for
those records provided for in subsection (6) of this section, shall not be divulged to anyone except:

well-being of the child, or would be in the best interests of the child. Following the

return all files, reports, notes, photographs, records, electronic and other communications, and
working papers used or developed by the children's advocacy center to the center; and
