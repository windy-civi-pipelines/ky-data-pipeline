4 (1) Anyone acting upon reasonable cause in the making of a report or acting under
5 KRS 620.030 to 620.050 in good faith shall have immunity from any liability, civil
6 or criminal, that might otherwise be incurred or imposed. Any such participant shall

10 (2) Any employee or designated agent of a children's advocacy center shall be immune
11 from any civil liability arising from performance within the scope of the person's
12 duties as provided in KRS 620.030 to 620.050. Any such person shall have the

20 under this section or for excluding evidence regarding a dependent, neglected, or
21 abused child or the cause thereof, in any judicial proceedings resulting from a report
22 pursuant to this section. This subsection shall also apply in any criminal proceeding
23 in District or Circuit Court regarding a dependent, neglected, or abused child.
