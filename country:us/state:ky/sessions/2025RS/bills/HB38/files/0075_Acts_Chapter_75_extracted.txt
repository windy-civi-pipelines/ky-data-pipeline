Section 1. KRS 403.735 is amended to read as follows:
(1) Prior to or at a hearing on a petition for an order of protection:
(a) The court may obtain the respondent's Kentucky criminal and protective order history and utilize that
information to assess what relief and which sanctions may protect against danger to the petitioner or
other person for whom protection is being sought, with the information so obtained being provided to
the parties in accordance with the Kentucky Rules of Civil Procedure; and
(b) If the petitioner or respondent is a minor, the court shall inquire whether the parties attend school in the
same school system to assist the court in imposing conditions in the order that have the least disruption
in the administration of education to the parties while providing appropriate protection to the petitioner.
(2) (a) If the adverse party is not present at the hearing ordered pursuant to KRS 403.730 and has not been
served, a previously issued emergency protective order shall remain in place, and the court shall direct
the issuance of a new summons for a hearing set not more than fourteen (14) days in the future. If
service has not been made on the adverse party before that hearing or a subsequent hearing, the
emergency protective order shall remain in place, and the court shall continue the hearing and issue a
new summons with a new date and time for the hearing to occur, which shall be within fourteen (14)
days of the originally scheduled date for the continued hearing. The court shall repeat the process of
continuing the hearing and reissuing a new summons until the adverse party is served in advance of the
scheduled hearing. If service has not been made on the respondent at least seventy-two (72) hours prior
to the scheduled hearing, the court may continue the hearing no more than fourteen (14) days in the
future. In issuing the summons, the court shall simultaneously transmit a copy of the summons or notice
of its issuance and provisions to the petitioner. Upon the request of the petitioner, the court may
excuse the petitioner from future court appearances until the respondent has been served.
(b) The provisions of this section permitting the continuance of an emergency protective order shall be
limited to six (6) months from the issuance of the emergency protective order. If the respondent has not
been served within that period, the order shall be rescinded without prejudice. Prior to the expiration of
the emergency protective order, the court shall provide notice to the petitioner stating that, if the
petitioner does not file a new petition, the order shall be rescinded without prejudice.
Section 2. KRS 403.763 is amended to read as follows:
(1) Violation of the terms or conditions of an order of protection after the person has been served or given notice
of the order shall constitute contempt of court and a criminal offense under this section. Once a criminal or
contempt proceeding has been initiated, the other shall not be undertaken regardless of the outcome of the
original proceeding.
(2) (a) Court proceedings for contempt of court for violation of an order of protection shall be held in the
county where the order was issued or filed.
(b) Court proceedings for a criminal violation of an order of protection shall follow the rules of venue
applicable to criminal cases generally.
(3) Nothing in this section shall preclude the Commonwealth from prosecuting and convicting the respondent of
criminal offenses other than violation of an order of protection.
(4) (a) A person is guilty of a violation of an order of protection when he or she intentionally violates the
provisions of an order of protection after the person has been served or given notice of the order.
(b) Violation of an order of protection is a Class A misdemeanor, unless the person who stands convicted
of a violation under this subsection has been convicted of two (2) or more previous violations of
orders of protection under this subsection, subsection (4)(a) of Section 4 of this Act, or KRS 508.155
