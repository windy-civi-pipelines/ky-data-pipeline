2 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
3 Section 1. KRS 403.735 is amended to read as follows:
4 (1) Prior to or at a hearing on a petition for an order of protection:
5 (a) The court may obtain the respondent's Kentucky criminal and protective order
6 history and utilize that information to assess what relief and which sanctions
7 may protect against danger to the petitioner or other person for whom
8 protection is being sought, with the information so obtained being provided to
9 the parties in accordance with the Kentucky Rules of Civil Procedure; and
10 (b) If the petitioner or respondent is a minor, the court shall inquire whether the
11 parties attend school in the same school system to assist the court in imposing
12 conditions in the order that have the least disruption in the administration of
13 education to the parties while providing appropriate protection to the
14 petitioner.
15 (2) (a) If the adverse party is not present at the hearing ordered pursuant to KRS
16 403.730 and has not been served, a previously issued emergency protective
17 order shall remain in place, and the court shall direct the issuance of a new
18 summons for a hearing set not more than fourteen (14) days in the future. If
19 service has not been made on the adverse party before that hearing or a
20 subsequent hearing, the emergency protective order shall remain in place, and
21 the court shall continue the hearing and issue a new summons with a new date
22 and time for the hearing to occur, which shall be within fourteen (14) days of
23 the originally scheduled date for the continued hearing. The court shall repeat
24 the process of continuing the hearing and reissuing a new summons until the
25 adverse party is served in advance of the scheduled hearing. If service has not
26 been made on the respondent at least seventy-two (72) hours prior to the
27 scheduled hearing, the court may continue the hearing no more than fourteen

1 (14) days in the future. In issuing the summons, the court shall simultaneously
2 transmit a copy of the summons or notice of its issuance and provisions to the
3 petitioner. Upon the request of the petitioner, the court may excuse the
4 petitioner from future court appearances until the respondent has been
5 served.
6 (b) The provisions of this section permitting the continuance of an emergency
7 protective order shall be limited to six (6) months from the issuance of the
8 emergency protective order. If the respondent has not been served within that
9 period, the order shall be rescinded without prejudice. Prior to the expiration
10 of the emergency protective order, the court shall provide notice to the
11 petitioner stating that, if the petitioner does not file a new petition, the order
12 shall be rescinded without prejudice.
13 Section 2. KRS 403.763 is amended to read as follows:
14 (1) Violation of the terms or conditions of an order of protection after the person has
15 been served or given notice of the order shall constitute contempt of court and a
16 criminal offense under this section. Once a criminal or contempt proceeding has
17 been initiated, the other shall not be undertaken regardless of the outcome of the
18 original proceeding.
19 (2) (a) Court proceedings for contempt of court for violation of an order of protection
20 shall be held in the county where the order was issued or filed.
21 (b) Court proceedings for a criminal violation of an order of protection shall
22 follow the rules of venue applicable to criminal cases generally.
23 (3) Nothing in this section shall preclude the Commonwealth from prosecuting and
24 convicting the respondent of criminal offenses other than violation of an order of
25 protection.
26 (4) (a) A person is guilty of a violation of an order of protection when he or she
27 intentionally violates the provisions of an order of protection after the person

2 (b) Violation of an order of protection is a Class A misdemeanor, unless the
3 person who stands convicted of a violation under this subsection has been
4 convicted of two (2) or more previous violations of orders of protection
5 under this subsection, subsection (4)(a) of Section 4 of this Act, or KRS
6 508.155 or 510.037 within the last five (5) years, in which case it is a Class

11 be the same protected person in the previous violations. The five (5) year
12 period shall be measured from the dates on which the offenses occurred for
13 which the judgments of conviction were entered.

20 the parties in accordance with the Kentucky Rules of Civil Procedure; and
21 (b) If the petitioner or respondent is a minor, the court shall inquire whether the
