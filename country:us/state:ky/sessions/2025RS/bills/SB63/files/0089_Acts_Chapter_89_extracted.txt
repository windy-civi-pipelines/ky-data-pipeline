(1) Before the owner of a motor vehicle, or street-legal special purpose vehicle as defined in Section 1 of this

a motor vehicle does not reside in the Commonwealth, the motor vehicle shall be registered with the county
clerk of the county in which the motor vehicle is principally operated. If the owner of a motor vehicle is other
than an individual and resides in the Commonwealth, the motor vehicle shall be registered with the county
clerk of either county. The application when presented to the county clerk for registration shall be
accompanied by:
(a) A bill of sale and a manufacturer's certificate of origin if the application is for the registration of a new

same notice required by KRS 134.805(5) of the date of expiration. In addition, the department shall provide
appropriate forms and information to permit renewal of motor vehicle registration to be completed by mail.
Any registration renewal by mail shall require payment of an additional two dollar ($2) fee which shall be
received by the county clerk. Nonreceipt of the notice herein shall not constitute a defense to any registration
related offense.
(6) (a) If an individual has been serving in the United States military stationed or assigned to a base or other
location outside the boundaries of the United States, he or she shall renew the registration on the vehicle
within thirty (30) days of his or her return if:

(1) Before the owner of a motor vehicle, or street-legal special purpose vehicle as defined in Section 1 of this
Act, may operate it or permit its operation upon a highway, the owner shall apply for registration in accordance

fifteen (15) day period. If the owner of a motor vehicle is an individual and resides in the Commonwealth, the
motor vehicle shall be registered with the county clerk of the county in which he or she resides. If the owner of
a motor vehicle does not reside in the Commonwealth, the motor vehicle shall be registered with the county
clerk of the county in which the motor vehicle is principally operated. If the owner of a motor vehicle is other
than an individual and resides in the Commonwealth, the motor vehicle shall be registered with the county
clerk of either county. The application when presented to the county clerk for registration shall be
accompanied by:
(a) A bill of sale and a manufacturer's certificate of origin if the application is for the registration of a new

(b) The owner's registration receipt, if the motor vehicle was last registered in this state;

Insofar as the owner is concerned, registration with the clerk shall be deemed to be registration with the
cabinet.

before the last day of the month of registration established pursuant to KRS 186.051(3).

the Commonwealth as provided by KRS 186A.035, the owner of the vehicle shall be notified by mail on the
same notice required by KRS 134.805(5) of the date of expiration. In addition, the department shall provide
appropriate forms and information to permit renewal of motor vehicle registration to be completed by mail.
Any registration renewal by mail shall require payment of an additional two dollar ($2) fee which shall be
received by the county clerk. Nonreceipt of the notice herein shall not constitute a defense to any registration
related offense.
(6) (a) If an individual has been serving in the United States military stationed or assigned to a base or other
location outside the boundaries of the United States, he or she shall renew the registration on the vehicle
within thirty (30) days of his or her return if:
1. The motor vehicle has been stored on a military base during the time of deployment and has not
been operated on the public highways during that time; and
2. The vehicle's registration expired during the individual's absence.
(b) An individual who meets the criteria in paragraph (a) of this subsection shall not be convicted or cited
for driving a vehicle with expired registration within thirty (30) days after the individual's return to the
Commonwealth if the individual can provide proof of meeting the eligibility criteria under paragraph
(a) of this subsection.
(c) When an individual presents evidence of meeting the criteria under paragraph (a) of this subsection
when applying to renew the registration on the motor vehicle, the county clerk shall, when applicable,
treat the registration as a prorated renewal under KRS 186.051, and charge the individual a registration
fee only for the number of months of the registration year the vehicle will be used on the public
highways.

operation or use of the vehicle on any public highway. No refund may be made under the provisions of KRS
186.056(2) until the title to the vehicle has been transferred to the purchaser thereof. Provided, however, that

be made on a basis commensurate with, and determined by, the miles traveled on, and use made of, the
highways of this Commonwealth as compared with the miles traveled on and use made of highways of
other states, or upon any other equitable basis of proportional registration. Notwithstanding the
provisions of KRS 186.020, the cabinet shall promulgate administrative regulations concerning the
registration of motor vehicles under any agreement or agreements made under this section and shall
