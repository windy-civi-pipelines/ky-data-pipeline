( HCR 20 )
A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION directing the Legislative Research Commission to study access to sexual
assault nurse examiners.
WHEREAS, a sexual assault nurse examiner (SANE) is a highly trained and specialized registered nurse who
provides compassionate and comprehensive care to patients who have experienced sexual assault or abuse; and
WHEREAS, a registered nurse who holds a SANE A/A credential issued by the Kentucky Board of Nursing is
trained in the forensic examination of adults and adolescents who have reached the onset of physiological normal
puberty or older who have been the victim of sexual assault or abuse; and
WHEREAS, a registered nurse who holds a SANE P/A credential issued by the Kentucky Board of Nursing is
trained in the forensic examination of pediatrics and adolescents who have not reached the onset of physiological
normal puberty or individuals up to age 18 who have been the victim of sexual assault or abuse; and
WHEREAS, a SANE collects and preserves evidence and testifies in legal proceedings of sexual assault or
abuse cases; and
WHEREAS, a SANE works in collaboration with the investigative team, prosecutors, the multidisciplinary
healthcare team, and protection and advocacy centers to ensure that sexual assault victims receive adequate trauma-
informed care after a sexual assault; and
WHEREAS, as of 2024, there were 449 credentialed SANE A/As and 41 credentialed SANE P/As; and
WHEREAS, in Kentucky there are six training centers for the SANE A/A credential and two for the SANE
P/A credential; and
WHEREAS, the Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence (SAFE) Act of 2016 has increased the number of law
enforcement officers trained to respond to and investigate sexual assault, increased the number of credentialed
SANEs and SANE-ready hospitals, decreased the window of time to test forensic evidence, created a sexual assault
forensic evidence (SAFE) kit tracking portal, paved the way for funding additional sexual assault investigators
dedicated to solving these types of crimes, and more; and
WHEREAS, there are 22 hospitals in Kentucky with a SANE-ready designation, but some do not employ more
than one SANE who is available 24/7; and
WHEREAS, the Sexual Assault Response Team Advisory Committee identifies increasing access to SANE
care across the Commonwealth as one component of addressing sexual violence that needs urgent action; and
WHEREAS, analysis of access to SANEs in the Commonwealth is necessary to help identify policy options
for improving access so that greater justice may be achieved for citizens of the Commonwealth who are victims of
sexual assault and abuse and greater safety may be secured for all citizens of the Commonwealth;
NOW, THEREFORE,
Be it resolved by the House of Representatives of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, the
Senate concurring therein:
