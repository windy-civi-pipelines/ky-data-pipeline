7 enrolled.
8 (15) Effective July 1, 2001, there shall be no deduction applied against the base funding
9 level for any pupil in average daily attendance who spends a portion of his or her
10 school day in a program at a state-operated career and technical education or
11 vocational facility.
12 (16) During a fiscal year, a school district may request that the Department of Education
13 recalculate its funds allocated under this section if the current year average daily
14 attendance for the twenty (20) day school month as defined in KRS 158.060(2)[(1)]
15 that contains the most days within the calendar month of January exceeds the prior
16 year adjusted average daily attendance plus growth by at least one percent (1%).
17 Any adjustments in the allotments approved under this subsection shall be
18 proportional to the remaining days in the school year and subject to available funds
19 under the program to support education excellence in Kentucky.
20 (17) To calculate the state portion of the program to support education excellence in
21 Kentucky for a school district, the Department of Education shall subtract the local
22 effort required under KRS 157.390(5) from the calculated base funding under the
23 program to support education excellence in Kentucky, as required by this section.
24 The value of the real estate used in this calculation shall be the lesser of the current
25 year assessment or the prior year assessment increased by four percent (4%) plus
26 the value of current year new property. The calculation under this subsection shall
27 be subject to available funds.
