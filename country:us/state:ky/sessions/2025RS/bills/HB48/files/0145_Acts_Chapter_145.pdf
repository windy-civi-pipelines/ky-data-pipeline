Section 10. KRS 157.360 is amended to read as follows:
Legislative Research Commission PDF Version

16 ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY
(1) (a) In determining the cost of the program to support education excellence in Kentucky, the statewide
guaranteed base funding level, as defined in KRS 157.320, shall be computed by dividing the amount
appropriated for this purpose by the prior year's statewide average daily attendance.
(b) When determining the biennial appropriations for the program, the average daily attendance for each
fiscal year shall include an estimate of the number of students graduating early under the provisions of
KRS 158.142.
(2) Each district shall receive an amount equal to the base funding level for each pupil in average daily attendance
in the district in the previous year, except a district shall receive an amount equal to one-half (1/2) of the state
portion of the average statewide per pupil guaranteed base funding level for each student who graduated early
under the provisions of KRS 158.142. Each district's base funding level shall be adjusted by the following
factors:
(a) The number of at-risk students in the district. At-risk students shall be identified as those approved for
the free lunch program under state and federal guidelines. The number of at-risk students shall be
multiplied by a factor to be established by the General Assembly. Funds generated under this paragraph
may be used to pay for:
1. Alternative programs for students who are at risk of dropping out of school before achieving a
diploma; and
2. A hazardous duty pay supplement as determined by the local board of education to the teachers
who work in alternative programs with students who are violent or assaultive;
(b) The number and types of exceptional children in the district as defined by KRS 157.200. Specific
weights for each category of exceptionality shall be used in the calculation of the add-on factor for
exceptional children; and
(c) Transportation costs. The per-pupil cost of transportation shall be calculated as provided by KRS
157.370. Districts which contract to furnish transportation to students attending nonpublic schools may
adopt any payment formula which ensures that no public school funds are used for the transportation of
nonpublic students.
(3) Beginning with the 2015-2016 school year and each year thereafter, the General Assembly shall annually
allocate funds equal to one-half (1/2) of the state portion of the average statewide per pupil guaranteed base
funding level for each student who graduated early under the provisions of KRS 158.142 the previous school
year to the Kentucky Higher Education Assistance Authority for deposit in the early graduation scholarship
trust fund.
(4) The program to support education excellence in Kentucky shall be fully implemented by the 1994-95 school
year.
(5) (a) Except for those schools which have implemented school-based decision making, the commissioner of
education shall enforce maximum class sizes for every academic course requirement in all grades
except in vocal and instrumental music, and physical education classes. Except as provided in
subsection (6) of this section, the maximum number of pupils enrolled in a class shall be as follows:
1. Twenty-four (24) in primary grades (kindergarten through third grade);
2. Twenty-eight (28) in grade four (4);
3. Twenty-nine (29) in grades five (5) and six (6);
4. Thirty-one (31) in grades seven (7) to twelve (12).
(b) Except for those schools which have implemented school-based decision making, class size loads for
middle and secondary school classroom teachers shall not exceed the equivalent of one hundred fifty
(150) pupil hours per day.
(c) The commissioner of education, upon approval of the Kentucky Board of Education, shall adopt
administrative regulations for enforcing this provision. These administrative regulations shall include
procedures for a superintendent to request an exemption from the Kentucky Board of Education when
unusual circumstances warrant an increased class size for an individual class. A request for an
exemption shall include specific reasons for the increased class size with a plan for reducing the class
size prior to the beginning of the next school year. A district shall not receive in any one (1) year

CHAPTER 145 17
exemptions for more classes than enroll twenty percent (20%) of the pupils in the primary grades and
grades four (4) through eight (8).
(d) In all schools the commissioner of education shall enforce the special education maximum class sizes
set by administrative regulations adopted by the Kentucky Board of Education. A superintendent may
request an exemption pursuant to paragraph (c) of this subsection. A local school council may request a
waiver pursuant to KRS 156.160(2). An exemption or waiver shall not be granted if the increased class
size will impede any exceptional child from achieving his or her individual education program in the
least restrictive environment.
(6) In grades four (4) through six (6) with combined grades, the maximum class size shall be the average daily
attendance upon which funding is appropriated for the lowest assigned grade in the class. There shall be no
exceptions to the maximum class size for combined classes. In combined classes other than the primary
grades, no ungraded students shall be placed in a combined class with graded students. In addition, there shall
be no more than two (2) consecutive grade levels combined in any one (1) class in grades four (4) through six
(6). However, this shall not apply to schools which have implemented school-based decision making.
(7) If a local school district, through its admission and release committee, determines that an appropriate program
in the least restrictive environment for a particular child with a disability includes either part-time or full-time
enrollment with a private school or agency within the state or a public or private agency in another state, the
school district shall count as average daily attendance in a public school the time that the child is in attendance
at the school or agency, contingent upon approval by the commissioner of education.
(8) Pupils attending a center for child learning and study established under an agreement pursuant to KRS 65.210
to 65.300 shall, for the purpose of calculating average daily attendance, be considered as in attendance in the
school district in which the child legally resides and which is party to the agreement. For purposes of
subsection (1) of this section, teachers who are actually employees of the joint or cooperative action shall be
considered as employees of each school district which is a party to the agreement.
(9) Program funding shall be increased when the average daily attendance in any district for the first two (2)
months of the current school year is greater than the average daily attendance of the district for the first two (2)
months of the previous school year. The program funds allotted the district shall be increased by the percent of
increase. The average daily attendance in kindergarten is the kindergarten full-time equivalent pupils in
average daily attendance.
(10) If the average daily attendance for the current school year in any district decreases by ten percent (10%) or
more than the average daily attendance for the previous school year, the average daily attendance for purposes
of calculating program funding for the next school year shall be increased by an amount equal to two-thirds
(2/3) of the decrease in average daily attendance. If the average daily attendance remains the same or decreases
in the succeeding school year, the average daily attendance for purposes of calculating program funding for the
following school year shall be increased by an amount equal to one-third (1/3) of the decrease for the first year
of the decline.
(11) If the percentage of attendance of any school district shall have been reduced more than two percent (2%)
during the previous school year, the program funding allotted the district for the current school year shall be
increased by the difference in the percentage of attendance for the two (2) years immediately prior to the
current school year less two percent (2%).
(12) (a) Instructional salaries for vocational agriculture classes shall be for twelve (12) months per year.
Vocational agriculture teachers shall be responsible for the following program of instruction during the
time period beyond the regular school term established by the local board of education: supervision and
instruction of students in agriculture experience programs; group and individual instruction of farmers
and agribusinessmen; supervision of student members of agricultural organizations who are involved in
leadership training or other activity required by state or federal law; or any program of vocational
agriculture established by the Department of Education. During extended employment, no vocational
agriculture teacher shall receive salary on a day that the teacher is scheduled to attend an institution of
higher education class which could be credited toward meeting any certification requirement.
(b) Each teacher of agriculture employed shall submit an annual plan for summer program to the local
school superintendent for approval. The summer plan shall include a list of tasks to be performed,
purposes for each task, and time to be spent on each task. Approval by the local school superintendent
shall be in compliance with the guidelines developed by the Department of Education. The supervision

18 ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY
and accountability of teachers of vocational agriculture's summer programs shall be the responsibility of
the local school superintendent. The local school superintendent shall submit to the commissioner of
education a completed report of summer tasks for each vocational agriculture teacher. Twenty percent
(20%) of the approved vocational agriculture programs shall be audited annually by the State
Department of Education to determine that the summer plan has been properly executed.
(13) (a) In allotting program funds for home and hospital instruction, statewide guaranteed base funding,
excluding the capital outlay, shall be allotted for each child in average daily attendance in the prior
school year who has been properly identified according to Kentucky Board of Education administrative
regulations. Attendance shall be calculated pursuant to KRS 157.270 and shall be reported monthly on
forms provided by the Department of Education; and
(b) Pursuant to administrative regulations of the Kentucky Board of Education, local school districts shall
be reimbursed for home and hospital instruction for pupils unable to attend regular school sessions
because of short-term health impairments. A reimbursement formula shall be established by
administrative regulations to include such factors as a reasonable per hour, per child allotment for
teacher instructional time, with a maximum number of funded hours per week, a reasonable allotment
for teaching supplies and equipment, and a reasonable allotment for travel expenses to and from
instructional assignments, but the formula shall not include an allotment for capital outlay. Attendance
shall be calculated pursuant to KRS 157.270 and shall be reported annually on forms provided by the
Department of Education.
(14) Except for those schools which have implemented school-based decision making and the school council has
voted to waive this subsection, kindergarten aides shall be provided for each twenty-four (24) full-time
equivalent kindergarten students enrolled.
(15) Effective July 1, 2001, there shall be no deduction applied against the base funding level for any pupil in
average daily attendance who spends a portion of his or her school day in a program at a state-operated career
and technical education or vocational facility.
(16) During a fiscal year, a school district may request that the Department of Education recalculate its funds
allocated under this section if the current year average daily attendance for the twenty (20) day school month
as defined in KRS 158.060(2)[(1)] that contains the most days within the calendar month of January exceeds
the prior year adjusted average daily attendance plus growth by at least one percent (1%). Any adjustments in
the allotments approved under this subsection shall be proportional to the remaining days in the school year
and subject to available funds under the program to support education excellence in Kentucky.

the Department of Education shall subtract the local effort required under KRS 157.390(5) from the calculated
base funding under the program to support education excellence in Kentucky, as required by this section. The
value of the real estate used in this calculation shall be the lesser of the current year assessment or the prior
year assessment increased by four percent (4%) plus the value of current year new property. The calculation
under this subsection shall be subject to available funds.
(18) Notwithstanding any other statute or budget of the Commonwealth language to the contrary, time missed due

programs operated in these schools, including interscholastic athletics, the Kentucky School for the Deaf, the
Kentucky School for the Blind, and community education programs and services.
(2) The Kentucky Board of Education may designate an organization or agency to manage interscholastic athletics
in the common schools, provided that the rules, regulations, and bylaws of any organization or agency so
designated shall be approved by the board, and provided further that any administrative hearing conducted by

(a) The state board or its designated agency shall assure through promulgation of administrative regulations
that if a secondary school sponsors or intends to sponsor an athletic activity or sport that is similar to a
sport for which National Collegiate Athletic Association members offer an athletic scholarship, the
school shall sponsor the athletic activity or sport for which a scholarship is offered. The administrative

CHAPTER 145 19
regulations shall specify which athletic activities are similar to sports for which National Collegiate
Athletic Association members offer scholarships.
(b) Beginning with the 2003-2004 school year, the state board shall require any agency or organization

members of the agency's or organization's board of control one (1) representative of nonpublic member
schools who is elected by the nonpublic school members of the agency or organization from regions
one (1) through eight (8) and one (1) representative of nonpublic member schools who is elected by the
nonpublic member schools of the agency or organization from regions nine (9) through sixteen (16).
The nonpublic school representatives on the board of control shall not be from classification A1 or D1
schools. Following initial election of these nonpublic school representatives to the agency's or
organization's board of control, terms of the nonpublic school representatives shall be staggered so that
only one (1) nonpublic school member is elected in each even-numbered year.
(c) The state board or any agency designated by the state board to manage interscholastic athletics shall not
promulgate rules, administrative regulations, or by laws that prohibit pupils in grades seven (7) to eight
(8) from participating in any high school sports except for high school varsity soccer and football, or
from participating on more than one (1) school-sponsored team at the same time in the same sport. The
Kentucky Board of Education, or an agency designated by the board to manage interscholastic athletics,
may promulgate administrative regulations restricting, limiting, or prohibiting participation in high
school varsity soccer and football for students who have not successfully completed the eighth grade.
(d) 1. The state board or any agency designated by the state board to manage interscholastic athletics
shall allow a member school's team or students to play against students of a nonmember at-home
private school, or a team of students from nonmember at-home private schools, if the
nonmember at-home private schools and students comply with this subsection.
2. A nonmember at-home private school's team and students shall comply with the rules for
student-athletes, including rules concerning:
a. Age;
b. School semesters;
c. Scholarships;
d. Physical exams;
e. Foreign student eligibility; and
f. Amateurs.
3. A coach of a nonmember at-home private school's team shall comply with the rules concerning
certification of member school coaches as required by the state board or any agency designated
by the state board to manage interscholastic athletics.
4. This subsection shall not allow a nonmember at-home private school's team to participate in a
sanctioned:
a. Conference;
b. Conference tournament;
c. District tournament;
d. Regional tournament; or
e. State tournament or event.
5. This subsection does not allow eligibility for a recognition, award, or championship sponsored
by the state board or any agency designated by the state board to manage interscholastic
athletics.
6. A nonmember at-home private school's team or students may participate in interscholastic
athletics permitted, offered, or sponsored by the state board or any agency designated by the state
board to manage interscholastic athletics.

regulations necessary to carry out this paragraph.
(j) No member school shall grant a student-athlete the right to use the member school's intellectual
property, such as trademarks, school uniforms, and copyrights, in the student's earning of compensation
through name, image, and likeness activities. No student-athlete shall use such intellectual property in
earning compensation through name, image, and likeness activities. The state board or any agency

supplement to classroom instruction throughout the Commonwealth and for incidental use in any other
proper public functions. The lease may be for any initial term commencing with the date of the lease
and ending with the next ensuing June 30, which is the close of the then-current fiscal biennium of the
Commonwealth, with exclusive options in favor of the board to renew the same for successive ensuing
bienniums, July 1 in each even year to June 30 in the next ensuing even year; and the rentals may be
fixed at the sums in each biennium, if renewed, sufficient to enable the State Property and Buildings
Commission to pay therefrom the maturing principal of and interest on, and provide reserves for, any
revenue bonds which the State Property and Buildings Commission may determine to be necessary and
sufficient, in agreement with the board, to provide the cost of acquiring the television and related
facilities with appurtenances and costs as may be incident to the issuance of the bonds.
(b) Each option of the Kentucky Board of Education to renew the lease for a succeeding biennial term may
be exercised at any time after the adjournment of the session of the General Assembly at which
appropriations shall have been made for the operation of the state government for such succeeding
biennial term, by notifying the State Property and Buildings Commission in writing, signed by the chief
state school officer, and delivered to the secretary of the Finance and Administration Cabinet as a
member of the commission. The option shall be deemed automatically exercised, and the lease
automatically renewed for the succeeding biennium, effective on the first day thereof, unless a written
notice of the board's election not to renew shall have been delivered in the office of the secretary of the
Finance and Administration Cabinet before the close of business on the last working day in April
immediately preceding the beginning of the succeeding biennium.
(c) The Kentucky Board of Education shall not itself operate leased television facilities, or undertake the
preparation of the educational presentations or films to be transmitted thereby, but may enter into one
(1) or more contracts to provide therefor, with any public agency and instrumentality of the
Commonwealth having, or able to provide, a staff with proper technical qualifications, upon which
agency and instrumentality the board, through the chief state school officer and the Department of
Education, is represented in such manner as to coordinate matters of curriculum with the curricula
prescribed for the public schools of the Commonwealth. Any contract for the operation of the leased
television or related facilities may permit limited and special uses of the television or related facilities
for other programs in the public interest, subject to the reasonable terms and conditions as the board and
the operating agency and instrumentality may agree upon; but any contract shall affirmatively forbid the
use of the television or related facilities, at any time or in any manner, in the dissemination of political
propaganda or in furtherance of the interest of any political party or candidate for public office, or for
commercial advertising. No lease between the board and the State Property and Buildings Commission
Legislative Research Commission PDF Version

22 ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

appropriations which may be made to it from state funds, from time to time, but also contributions,
gifts, matching funds, devises, and bequests from any source, whether federal or state, and whether
public or private, so long as the same are not conditioned upon any improper use of the television or
related facilities in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of this subsection.
(4) The state board may, on the recommendation and with the advice of the chief state school officer, prescribe,
print, publish, and distribute at public expense such administrative regulations, courses of study, curriculums,
bulletins, programs, outlines, reports, and placards as each deems necessary for the efficient management,

improvement plans and school districts to complete continuous district improvement plans. For each submission
request, the report shall:

and districts subject to each specific submission request during the 2024-2025 school year; and
3. State whether the Cognia software permits schools and districts not subject to the submission request a
clear opportunity to bypass the submission request. If so, the report shall provide screenshots of the instructions
provided to the software user on the procedure to bypass a submission request not required from a particular school
or district.
(2) No later than October 1, 2025, the department shall submit report to the Legislative Research
Commission for referral to the Education Assessment and Accountability Review Subcommittee that lists each
submission request that is not directly required by a specific federal law or state statute that the department
recommends the General Assembly to authorize in statute during the 2026 Regular Session.
(3) No later than August 1, 2026, each submission request that is not directly required by a specific federal
law or state statute on that date shall be eliminated from the school and district planning process and removed from
the designated school planning software interface.
(4) No later than August 1, 2026, the designated school planning software interface shall be replaced or
updated to provide schools or districts not subject to a specific federal law or state statutory requirement a clear
opportunity to bypass the submission request. The department, in their role as the designated state education agency
responsible for the oversight and management of school assessment and accountability, shall be responsible for
auditing school and school district compliance with federal reporting requirements and ensure that each school and
district has satisfied the reporting requirements of federal law and state statute.

CHAPTER 145 23

(c) The required contents of each required report;
(d) The function or purpose of each required report;
(e) The frequency of each required report;

(g) Whether and how each required report is leveraged to improve the quality of public education in the
Commonwealth; and
(h) An analysis of whether the reporting requirement is conducive to an efficient and effective system of
common schools.
(2) The report required by subsection (1) of this section shall be organized by the specific legal source of
authority of each reporting requirement. The report shall clearly distinguish between reporting requirements expressly
required pursuant to federal law, state statute, and all other reporting requirements.
(3) All reporting requirements identified under this section imposed upon public schools and school
districts that are not expressly required by state statute or federal law shall have no force and effect after June 30,
2026, unless preserved in statute by an act of the General Assembly. No later than July 1, 2026, the Kentucky
Department of Education shall eliminate all reporting requirements not expressly required by state statute or federal
law. The department shall promptly notify each public school, school district, and the Legislative Research
Commission of the reporting requirements eliminated in accordance with this section.
