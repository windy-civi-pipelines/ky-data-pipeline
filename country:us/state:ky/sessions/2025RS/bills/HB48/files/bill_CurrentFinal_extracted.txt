16 shall not exceed the equivalent of one hundred fifty (150) pupil hours per day.
17 (c) The commissioner of education, upon approval of the Kentucky Board of
18 Education, shall adopt administrative regulations for enforcing this provision.
19 These administrative regulations shall include procedures for a superintendent
20 to request an exemption from the Kentucky Board of Education when unusual
21 circumstances warrant an increased class size for an individual class. A
22 request for an exemption shall include specific reasons for the increased class

1 education maximum class sizes set by administrative regulations adopted by
2 the Kentucky Board of Education. A superintendent may request an
3 exemption pursuant to paragraph (c) of this subsection. A local school council
4 may request a waiver pursuant to KRS 156.160(2). An exemption or waiver
5 shall not be granted if the increased class size will impede any exceptional
6 child from achieving his or her individual education program in the least
7 restrictive environment.
8 (6) In grades four (4) through six (6) with combined grades, the maximum class size
9 shall be the average daily attendance upon which funding is appropriated for the
10 lowest assigned grade in the class. There shall be no exceptions to the maximum
11 class size for combined classes. In combined classes other than the primary grades,
12 no ungraded students shall be placed in a combined class with graded students. In

17 that an appropriate program in the least restrictive environment for a particular child
18 with a disability includes either part-time or full-time enrollment with a private
19 school or agency within the state or a public or private agency in another state, the
20 school district shall count as average daily attendance in a public school the time
21 that the child is in attendance at the school or agency, contingent upon approval by
22 the commissioner of education.
23 (8) Pupils attending a center for child learning and study established under an
24 agreement pursuant to KRS 65.210 to 65.300 shall, for the purpose of calculating

2 a party to the agreement.
3 (9) Program funding shall be increased when the average daily attendance in any
4 district for the first two (2) months of the current school year is greater than the
5 average daily attendance of the district for the first two (2) months of the previous
6 school year. The program funds allotted the district shall be increased by the
7 percent of increase. The average daily attendance in kindergarten is the
8 kindergarten full-time equivalent pupils in average daily attendance.
9 (10) If the average daily attendance for the current school year in any district decreases
10 by ten percent (10%) or more than the average daily attendance for the previous
11 school year, the average daily attendance for purposes of calculating program
12 funding for the next school year shall be increased by an amount equal to two-thirds
13 (2/3) of the decrease in average daily attendance. If the average daily attendance
14 remains the same or decreases in the succeeding school year, the average daily
15 attendance for purposes of calculating program funding for the following school
16 year shall be increased by an amount equal to one-third (1/3) of the decrease for the
17 first year of the decline.
18 (11) If the percentage of attendance of any school district shall have been reduced more
19 than two percent (2%) during the previous school year, the program funding
20 allotted the district for the current school year shall be increased by the difference in
21 the percentage of attendance for the two (2) years immediately prior to the current
22 school year less two percent (2%).
23 (12) (a) Instructional salaries for vocational agriculture classes shall be for twelve (12)
24 months per year. Vocational agriculture teachers shall be responsible for the

6 that the teacher is scheduled to attend an institution of higher education class
7 which could be credited toward meeting any certification requirement.
8 (b) Each teacher of agriculture employed shall submit an annual plan for summer
9 program to the local school superintendent for approval. The summer plan
10 shall include a list of tasks to be performed, purposes for each task, and time

12 in compliance with the guidelines developed by the Department of Education.
13 The supervision and accountability of teachers of vocational agriculture's
14 summer programs shall be the responsibility of the local school
15 superintendent. The local school superintendent shall submit to the

18 vocational agriculture programs shall be audited annually by the State
19 Department of Education to determine that the summer plan has been properly
20 executed.
21 (13) (a) In allotting program funds for home and hospital instruction, statewide
22 guaranteed base funding, excluding the capital outlay, shall be allotted for
23 each child in average daily attendance in the prior school year who has been

2 pupils unable to attend regular school sessions because of short-term health
3 impairments. A reimbursement formula shall be established by administrative
4 regulations to include such factors as a reasonable per hour, per child
5 allotment for teacher instructional time, with a maximum number of funded
6 hours per week, a reasonable allotment for teaching supplies and equipment,
7 and a reasonable allotment for travel expenses to and from instructional
8 assignments, but the formula shall not include an allotment for capital outlay.
9 Attendance shall be calculated pursuant to KRS 157.270 and shall be reported

17 school day in a program at a state-operated career and technical education or
18 vocational facility.
19 (16) During a fiscal year, a school district may request that the Department of Education
20 recalculate its funds allocated under this section if the current year average daily
21 attendance for the twenty (20) day school month as defined in KRS 158.060(2)[(1)]
22 that contains the most days within the calendar month of January exceeds the prior
23 year adjusted average daily attendance plus growth by at least one percent (1%).
24 Any adjustments in the allotments approved under this subsection shall be
25 proportional to the remaining days in the school year and subject to available funds
26 under the program to support education excellence in Kentucky.

5 year assessment or the prior year assessment increased by four percent (4%) plus
6 the value of current year new property. The calculation under this subsection shall
7 be subject to available funds.

16 lands, buildings, structures, installations, and facilities suitable for use in
17 establishing and furthering television and related facilities as an aid or
18 supplement to classroom instruction throughout the Commonwealth and for
19 incidental use in any other proper public functions. The lease may be for any
20 initial term commencing with the date of the lease and ending with the next
21 ensuing June 30, which is the close of the then-current fiscal biennium of the
22 Commonwealth, with exclusive options in favor of the board to renew the
23 same for successive ensuing bienniums, July 1 in each even year to June 30 in
24 the next ensuing even year; and the rentals may be fixed at the sums in each
25 biennium, if renewed, sufficient to enable the State Property and Buildings
26 Commission to pay therefrom the maturing principal of and interest on, and
27 provide reserves for, any revenue bonds which the State Property and
Page 48 of 53
HB004820.100 - 24 - XXXX 3/28/2025 10:23 AM Engrossed

1 Buildings Commission may determine to be necessary and sufficient, in
2 agreement with the board, to provide the cost of acquiring the television and
3 related facilities with appurtenances and costs as may be incident to the
4 issuance of the bonds.
5 (b) Each option of the Kentucky Board of Education to renew the lease for a
6 succeeding biennial term may be exercised at any time after the adjournment
7 of the session of the General Assembly at which appropriations shall have
8 been made for the operation of the state government for such succeeding
9 biennial term, by notifying the State Property and Buildings Commission in
10 writing, signed by the chief state school officer, and delivered to the secretary
11 of the Finance and Administration Cabinet as a member of the commission.
12 The option shall be deemed automatically exercised, and the lease
13 automatically renewed for the succeeding biennium, effective on the first day
14 thereof, unless a written notice of the board's election not to renew shall have
15 been delivered in the office of the secretary of the Finance and Administration

17 immediately preceding the beginning of the succeeding biennium.
18 (c) The Kentucky Board of Education shall not itself operate leased television
19 facilities, or undertake the preparation of the educational presentations or
20 films to be transmitted thereby, but may enter into one (1) or more contracts
21 to provide therefor, with any public agency and instrumentality of the
22 Commonwealth having, or able to provide, a staff with proper technical
23 qualifications, upon which agency and instrumentality the board, through the
24 chief state school officer and the Department of Education, is represented in
25 such manner as to coordinate matters of curriculum with the curricula
26 prescribed for the public schools of the Commonwealth. Any contract for the
27 operation of the leased television or related facilities may permit limited and

4 shall affirmatively forbid the use of the television or related facilities, at any
5 time or in any manner, in the dissemination of political propaganda or in
6 furtherance of the interest of any political party or candidate for public office,
7 or for commercial advertising. No lease between the board and the State
8 Property and Buildings Commission shall bind the board to pay rentals for
9 more than one (1) fiscal biennium at a time, subject to the aforesaid renewal
10 options. The board may receive and may apply to rental payments under any
11 lease and to the cost of providing for the operation of the television or related
12 facilities not only appropriations which may be made to it from state funds,
13 from time to time, but also contributions, gifts, matching funds, devises, and
14 bequests from any source, whether federal or state, and whether public or
15 private, so long as the same are not conditioned upon any improper use of the
16 television or related facilities in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of
17 this subsection.
18 (4) The state board may, on the recommendation and with the advice of the chief state
19 school officer, prescribe, print, publish, and distribute at public expense such

21 outlines, reports, and placards as each deems necessary for the efficient
22 management, control, and operation of the schools and programs under its
23 jurisdiction. All administrative regulations published or distributed by the board
24 shall be enclosed in a booklet or binder on which the words "informational copy"
25 shall be clearly stamped or printed.

7 directly required by a specific federal law or state statute that the department
8 recommends the General Assembly to authorize in statute during the 2026 Regular
9 Session.
10 (3) No later than August 1, 2026, each submission request that is not directly

12 school and district planning process and removed from the designated school planning
13 software interface.
14 (4) No later than August 1, 2026, the designated school planning software

17 submission request. The department, in their role as the designated state education agency
18 responsible for the oversight and management of school assessment and accountability,
19 shall be responsible for auditing school and school district compliance with federal
20 reporting requirements and ensure that each school and district has satisfied the reporting
21 requirements of federal law and state statute.

9 (10) If the average daily attendance for the current school year in any district decreases
10 by ten percent (10%) or more than the average daily attendance for the previous
11 school year, the average daily attendance for purposes of calculating program
12 funding for the next school year shall be increased by an amount equal to two-thirds
13 (2/3) of the decrease in average daily attendance. If the average daily attendance
14 remains the same or decreases in the succeeding school year, the average daily
15 attendance for purposes of calculating program funding for the following school
16 year shall be increased by an amount equal to one-third (1/3) of the decrease for the
17 first year of the decline.
18 (11) If the percentage of attendance of any school district shall have been reduced more
19 than two percent (2%) during the previous school year, the program funding
