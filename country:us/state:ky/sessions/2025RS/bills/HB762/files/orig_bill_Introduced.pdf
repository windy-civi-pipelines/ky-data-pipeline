1 AN ACT relating to the Interstate Dental and Dental Hygiene Licensure Compact.
2 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
3 SECTION 1. A NEW SECTION OF KRS CHAPTER 313 IS CREATED TO
4 READ AS FOLLOWS:
5 Section 1. PURPOSE.
6 This Compact shall be known as the Interstate Dental and Dental Hygiene Licensure
7 Compact and the purpose of the Compact is to expedite licensure and increase access
8 to dental health care through licensure boards acting in cooperation. The Compact
9 adopts the existing structures most utilized by dental boards across the United States,
10 while ensuring the safety of the public through the sharing of documents and
11 information. This Compact ensures that each state retains the right to impose an
12 adverse action on a licensee as a home state or as a practicing state. Each state has an
13 opportunity to share investigations and information with the home state of licensure.
14 The Compact is operated by state dental board members, administrators, and other
15 staff, thus allowing for each state to maintain its sovereignty. The Compact:
16 (a) Allows for expedited licensure portability and ease of movement of licensees
17 between states;
18 (b) Allows each state to continue to regulate the practice of dentistry and dental
19 hygiene within its borders;
20 (c) Creates a common goal of protecting the public by ensuring a uniform licensure
21 standard and sharing of information in the Compact;
22 (d) Allows for licensure in every participating state by requiring passage of the
23 uniform licensure examination that assesses psychomotor and cognitive dental
24 skills and is currently accepted in fifty (50) state licensing jurisdictions and
25 United States territories;
26 (e) Gives licensees one (1) location to maintain professional documentation to
27 expedite license transfers in states, hospitals, or institutional credentialing;

1 (f) Facilitates a faster licensure process for relocation or separation of military
2 members and their dependent spouses; there are no compact fees for military
3 members or their spouses;

24 of discipline or suspended, then automatically all other compact license privileges
25 shall be placed in the same status. The home state dental board shall notify the
26 commission and the commission shall issue a notice to all member state dental
27 boards of such adverse action.

1 (g) If discipline or an adverse action is taken against a compact license privilege
2 holder in a member state, the member state board shall notify the commission
3 and the home state of the compact license privilege holder. The home state may
4 deem the action conclusive as a matter of law and fact and may:
5 (1) Impose the same or lesser sanction consistent with the home state’s laws; or
6 (2) Pursue separate actions against the compact license privilege holder under
7 its laws, regardless of the sanctions pursued by the member state dental
8 board.
9 Section 10. OTHER REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION FROM THE REPOSITORY
10 AND THE CLEARINGHOUSE

12 extended to a dentist or dental hygienist may seek information from the
13 clearinghouse for public record documents;
14 (b) A dentist or dental hygienist may submit a request to the commission to allow any
15 hiring employer, entity, or insurance company to access documents from the
16 repository for the purposes of credentialing, licensing, or other privileges.
17 (c) The commission shall set a fee schedule for these services.
18 Section 11. RULEMAKING FUNCTIONS OF THE COMMISSION
19 (a) The commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and
20 efficiently implement and achieve the purposes and administration of the
21 Compact. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the commission exercises
22 its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of
23 the Compact or the powers granted hereunder, then such an action by the
24 commission may be determined to be invalid and have no force or effect.
25 (b) Rules validly issued by the commission shall have the force of law in each
26 member state.
27 (c) Rules deemed appropriate for the operations of the commission shall be made

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1803
1 pursuant to a rulemaking process that substantially conforms to the Model State
2 Administrative Procedure Act of 2010, and subsequent amendments thereto.
3 Section 12. OVERSIGHT OF THE COMPACT
4 (a) The executive, legislative, and judicial branches of state government in each
5 member state shall enforce the Compact and shall take all actions necessary and
6 appropriate to effectuate the Compact's purposes and intent to allow for expedited
7 licensure for the purpose of mobility. The provisions of the Compact and the
8 rules promulgated hereunder shall have standing as statutory law but shall not
9 override existing state authority to regulate the practice of dentistry and dental
10 hygiene.
11 (b) All courts may take judicial notice of the Compact and the rules in any judicial or
12 administrative proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of
13 the Compact which may affect the powers, responsibilities, or actions of the
14 commission.
15 (c) The commission shall be entitled to receive all service of process in any such
16 proceeding and shall have standing to intervene in the proceeding for all
17 purposes. Except where the commission has intervened, failure to provide service
18 of process to the commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the
19 commission, the Compact or promulgated rules.
20 Section 13. ENFORCEMENT AND DEFAULT PROCEDURES
21 (a) The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the
22 provisions and rules of the Compact.
23 (b) The grounds for default under this Compact by a member state include, but are
24 not limited to, failure of a member state to perform such obligations or
25 responsibilities imposed upon it by the Compact or by the rules and bylaws of the
26 commission promulgated under the Compact.
27 (c) If the commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the
Page 18 of 22
XXXX 2/18/2025 11:52 AM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1803
1 performance of its obligations or responsibilities under the Compact, or the
2 bylaws or promulgated rules, the commission shall:
3 (1) Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states of the
4 nature of the default, the means of curing the default and any action taken
5 by the commission. The commission shall specify the conditions by which
6 the defaulting state must cure its default; and
7 (2) Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the
8 default.
9 (d) If the defaulting state fails to cure the default, the defaulting state shall be
10 terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the
11 commissioners and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by the Compact
12 shall terminate on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not
13 relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period
14 of the default.
15 (e) Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only after all other
16 means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to terminate
17 shall be given by the commission to the governor, the majority and minority
18 leaders of the defaulting state's legislature and each of the member states.
19 (f) The commission shall establish rules and procedures to address licensees and
20 compact license privilege holders that are materially impacted by the termination
21 of a member state or the withdrawal of a member state.
22 (g) The commission shall not bear any costs relating to any state that has been found
23 to be in default or which has been terminated from the Compact, unless otherwise
24 mutually agreed upon in writing between the commission and the defaulting
25 state.
26 (h) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the
27 state court where the commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party
Page 19 of 22

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1803
1 shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.
2 (i) The commission shall not bear any costs relating to any state that has been found
3 to be in default or which has been terminated from the Compact, unless otherwise
4 mutually agreed upon in writing between the commission and the defaulting
5 state.
6 (j) The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the commission. The
7 commission may avail itself of any other remedies available under state law or the
8 regulation of a profession.
9 Section 14. DISPUTE RESOLUTION
10 (a) The commission shall attempt, upon the request of a member state dental board,
11 to resolve disputes which are subject to the compact and which may arise among
12 member state dental boards.
13 (b) The commission shall promulgate rules providing for both mediation and
14 voluntary binding dispute resolution, as appropriate.
15 Section 15. MEMBER STATES, EFFECTIVE DATE AND AMENDMENT
16 (a) Any state is eligible to become a member state of the Compact.
17 (b) The Compact shall become effective and binding upon legislative enactment of
18 the Compact into law by no less than five (5) states. Thereafter, it shall become
19 effective and binding on a state upon enactment of the Compact into law by that
20 state.
21 (c) The governors of nonmember states, or their designees, shall be invited to
22 participate in the activities of the commission on a nonvoting basis prior to
23 adoption of the Compact by all states.
24 (d) The commission may propose amendments to the Compact for enactment by the
25 member states. No amendment shall become effective and binding upon the
26 commission and the member states unless and until it is enacted into law by
27 unanimous consent of the member states.

1 Section 16. WITHDRAWAL
2 (a) Once effective, the Compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon
3 each and every member state; provided, however, that a member state may
4 withdraw from the Compact after giving appropriate notice by specifically
5 repealing the statute which enacted the Compact into law.
6 (b) The licensee’s compact license privilege shall remain in effect for six (6) months
7 from the date of the member state dental board withdrawal.
8 (c) The withdrawing state shall immediately notify the chairperson of the
9 commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing the Compact
10 by the withdrawing state, and upon the enactment of such legislation.
11 (d) The commission shall notify the other member states within sixty (60) days of its
12 receipt of notice provided under Section 16(c) of this Compact.
13 (e) Reinstatement following withdrawal of a member state shall occur upon the
14 withdrawing state reenacting the Compact or upon such later date as determined
15 by the commission.
16 (f) The commission shall issue rules to address the impact of the withdrawal of a
17 member state on licenses granted by other member states to dentists and dental
18 hygienists who designated the withdrawing member state as their home state.
19 Section 17. DISSOLUTION
20 (a) The Compact shall dissolve effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of
21 the member state which reduces the membership in the Compact to one (1)
22 member state.
23 (b) Upon the dissolution of the Compact, the Compact shall become null and void
24 and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the
25 commission shall be concluded and surplus funds shall be distributed in
26 accordance with the bylaws.

Page 21 of 22
XXXX 2/18/2025 11:52 AM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1803
1 (a) The provisions of the Compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause,
2 sentence, or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the
3 Compact shall be enforceable.
4 (b) The provisions of the Compact shall be liberally construed to effectuate its
5 purposes.
6 Section 19. BINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT AND OTHER LAWS
7 (a) Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a member state that
8 is not inconsistent with the Compact.
9 (b) All lawful actions of the commission, including all rules and bylaws promulgated
10 by the commission, shall be binding upon the member states.
11 (c) All agreements between the commission and the member states shall be binding
12 in accordance with their terms.
13 (d) In the event any provision of the Compact exceeds the constitutional limits
14 imposed on the legislature of any member state, such provision shall be
15 ineffective to the extent of the conflict with the constitutional provision in
16 question in that member state.
17 Section 20. RULES OF ORDER
18 The most current edition of the American Institute of Parliamentarians Standard Code
19 of Parliamentary Procedure shall be used for all meetings of the commission,
20 including its committees, in those situations not otherwise covered in the bylaws.
