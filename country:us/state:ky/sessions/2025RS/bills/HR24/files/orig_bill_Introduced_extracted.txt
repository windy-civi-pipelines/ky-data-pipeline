2 adversely affects the housing industry.
3 WHEREAS, the Commonwealth of Kentucky is committed to addressing
4 homelessness and housing insecurity by ensuring that housing policies and programs
5 uphold accountability and are tailored to the unique needs of local communities; and
6 WHEREAS, the federal government has limited the flexibility of states and local
7 governments to adopt community-specific solutions to homelessness and housing
8 insecurity by imposing complex compliance measures through its Continuum of Care
9 Program interim rule; and
10 WHEREAS, excessive federal regulations on homebuilders, landlords, and housing
11 providers increase construction costs, reduce housing supply, and make homeownership
12 and rental housing less affordable for Kentuckians; and
13 WHEREAS, the federally mandated Homeless Management Information System
14 rule places an undue administrative burden on state and local agencies that reduces the
15 ability for state and local agencies to focus on direct services to the community due to the
16 substantial data collection and reporting requirements; and
17 WHEREAS, the federal requirements under the United States Department of
18 Housing and Urban Development's performance standards and measures have
19 incentivized a one-size-fits-all approach that may not accurately reflect the unique
20 challenges faced by diverse communities or promote innovative, community-based
21 approaches to reducing homelessness; and
22 WHEREAS, federal policy mandates have limited the ability of local service
23 providers to offer a range of housing and service options, which curbs flexibility and
24 hinders efforts to support clients with varying levels of need and readiness for permanent
25 housing; and
26 WHEREAS, current federal standards under the Emergency Solutions Grants
27 Program restrict local agencies from utilizing resources effectively, often leading to

1 misalignment with community-specific priorities and reducing the impact of services
2 provided to the Commonwealth’s most vulnerable populations; and
3 WHEREAS, the 2009 amendments to the McKinney-Vento Act have resulted in a
4 proliferation of federal mandates that limit the Commonwealth’s ability to adapt its
5 approach to the needs of diverse populations experiencing homelessness; and
6 WHEREAS, permanent supportive housing, while essential for many individuals,
7 should not be the sole or primary solution for all experiencing homelessness, and
8 excessive reliance on federal permanent supportive housing standards has constrained the
9 Commonwealth’s capacity to develop diverse housing solutions and funding structures;
10 and
11 WHEREAS, block grant funding would allow the Commonwealth to better
12 leverage United States Department of Housing and Urban Development assistance by
13 granting the state more discretion over the allocation of funds, enabling local agencies to
14 design programs tailored to the specific needs of Kentucky's homeless and housing
15 insecure populations;
16 NOW, THEREFORE,
17 Be it resolved by the House of Representatives of the General Assembly of the
18 Commonwealth of Kentucky:
19 Section 1. This honorable body urges the United States Department of Housing
20 and Urban Development to:
21 (1) Repeal the Continuum of Care interim rule to provide more flexibility for
22 state and local governments to design housing solutions that are responsive to local
23 conditions;
24 (2) Amend the Homeless Management Information System rule to streamline
25 reporting requirements, reduce administrative burdens, and allow providers to direct more
26 resources toward client service;
27 (3) Eliminate performance standards and measures, allowing local governments

1 and agencies the freedom to set performance indicators that more accurately reflect
2 community needs and goals:
3 (4) Rescind housing first policy mandates to permit flexibility for communities to
4 offer a variety of housing options that meet the diverse needs and preferences of
5 individuals and families experiencing homelessness; and
6 (5) Reduce federal standards in the Emergency Solutions Grants Program to
7 better align with local priorities, ensuring resources are effectively allocated to maximize
8 community impact.
9 Section 2. This honorable body urges the United States Congress to advance
10 legislation to:
11 (1) Repeal the 2009 amendments to the McKinney-Vento Act to decrease
12 restrictive federal mandates and increase state autonomy in addressing homelessness;
13 (2) Reduce the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's
14 role in permanent supportive housing programs to allow local agencies more freedom in
15 implementing supportive housing options tailored to their specific populations; and
16 (3) Shift United States Department of Housing and Urban Development funding
17 to block grants rather than direct assistance to enable states to have greater flexibility in
18 allocating funds to areas of greatest need, allowing for a more effective response to
19 homelessness in the Commonwealth.
20 Section 3. The Clerk of the House of Representatives is directed to transmit
21 copies of this resolution to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the
22 United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, and each member of Kentucky’s
23 Congressional delegation.
