UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1720
2 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
3 Section 1. KRS 224.50-760 is amended to read as follows:
4 (1) (a) For purposes of this section and KRS 224.46-580(7), special wastes are those
5 wastes of high volume and low hazard which include but are not limited to
6 mining wastes, utility wastes (fly ash, bottom ash, scrubber sludge), wastes
7 from coal gasification facilities (vitrified coarse solid residues, prilled or
8 blocked sulfur) approved by the cabinet based on submittal of appropriate
9 testing demonstrating that the wastes are of low hazard, sludge from water
10 treatment facilities and wastewater treatment facilities, cement kiln dust, gas
11 and oil drilling muds, and oil production brines. Other wastes may be
12 designated special wastes by the cabinet;
13 (b) 1. Disposal sites or facilities for special wastes shall be exempt from the
14 provisions of KRS 224.46-520 and the provisions of KRS 224.43-810
15 and 224.43-815 but may be regulated by the cabinet consistent with the
16 Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended (Pub. L.
17 94-580), and regulations issued pursuant thereto, unless the special
18 waste received is listed or meets the criteria of a hazardous waste in
19 regulations pursuant to KRS 224.46-510(3).
20 2. Coal combustion by-products or utility wastes that qualify as special
21 wastes under this section may be beneficially reused at underground
22 or surface coal mines as structural fill, backfill, material for
23 contouring, mine stabilization, or reclamation material in accordance
24 with the requirements of this chapter and the administrative
25 regulations promulgated hereunder. The resulting reclaimed land may
26 be used for any purposes for which it is suitable, including
27 agricultural purposes.

1 3. If the special waste is a hazardous waste as specified in regulations
2 pursuant to KRS 224.46-510(3), the site or facility shall be required by
3 the cabinet to comply with the provisions of KRS 224.46-520 but shall
4 not be subject to the requirements of KRS 224.40-310(6);
5 (c) Generators of special wastes shall register with the cabinet and be subject to
6 the provisions of KRS 224.46-510, except for generators of coal mining
7 wastes which shall be regulated pursuant to the provisions of KRS Chapter
8 350;
9 (d) The cabinet shall, when promulgating regulations affecting special waste,
10 recognize special waste as a separate and distinct indivisible category and
11 shall recognize the distinct differences between the category of special wastes
12 and other hazardous wastes and solid wastes as defined in KRS 224.1-
13 010(30)(a) and 109.012(12) due to the fact that special wastes have large
14 volume but low hazardousness. The cabinet's regulations for the generation,
15 transport, recordkeeping, reporting, treatment, storage, and disposal shall
16 reflect those distinct differences. The cabinet's regulations shall recognize and
17 incorporate, where appropriate, and if consistent with the policies of KRS
18 224.46-510 to 224.46-570, any deadline extensions, studies, and specialized
19 requirements for specific kinds of special wastes that are or may be
20 undertaken at the federal or other levels of government; and
21 (e) It is the intent of the General Assembly that the processing of sludge from
22 water treatment facilities and wastewater treatment facilities by composting
23 shall be considered an industrial process. The cabinet shall, when
24 promulgating administrative regulations affecting sludge from water treatment
25 facilities and wastewater treatment facilities, consider the treatment of this
26 sludge by composting as an industrial process. The provisions of this
27 paragraph and subsection (3) of this section shall not apply to a city, county,

1 urban-county government, charter county government, or special district as
2 defined in KRS Chapter 65, or to a public or private college or university that
3 processes its own water treatment or wastewater treatment sludge by
4 composting on property owned or leased by the city, county, urban-county
5 government, charter county government, special district, or public or private
6 college or university.
7 (2) Generators of waste oil shall be exempt from the provisions of KRS 224.46-510 and
8 224.46-520 so long as waste oil is not specified as a hazardous waste in regulations
9 pursuant to KRS 224.46-510(3) but may be regulated by the cabinet consistent with
10 the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended (Pub. L. 94-
11 580), and regulations issued pursuant thereto.
12 (3) A permit application to establish, operate, or modify a composting site or
13 composting facility for the processing of water treatment sludge or wastewater
14 treatment sludge, shall require immediately the general public notice provided for in
15 KRS 224.40-310(4) and (5). If a hearing is requested, no permit to establish,
16 operate, or modify a composting site or facility shall be issued prior to the public
17 hearing. The hearing shall be held within the county where the composting site or
18 facility is located or proposed. Composting of this sludge shall be considered an
19 industrial process.
