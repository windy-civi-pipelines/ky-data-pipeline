1 Rule 7. Withdrawal of Motions. Every oral motion after it has been stated by
2 the Speaker, and every written motion, bill, resolution or other paper, after it has been
3 read by the Clerk, shall be the property and in the possession of the House and shall not
4 be withdrawn without consent of the House. Every written motion, report or measure
5 may be committed or recommitted at the pleasure of the House.
6 Rule 8. Order of Questions. All questions, whether in Committee of the Whole
7 or in the House, when not privileged questions, shall be propounded in the order in which
8 they were moved, except that in filling blanks the smallest sum and the most remote date
9 shall be put first.
10 Rule 9. Precedence of Motions. When a question is under consideration, no
11 motion shall be in order except:
12 1. To call the House when there is no quorum present.
13 2. To fix the time to which the House shall adjourn.
14 3. To adjourn.
15 4. To take recess.
16 5. To lay on the table.

25 arranged and the first seven of them shall not be debatable.

27 question, to limit or extend limits of debate, to postpone to a time certain, to lay on the
Page 4 of 46

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 812
1 Clerk’s desk, to refer or commit or to postpone indefinitely shall not be in order on the
2 same day, upon the same question, and at the same status unless other business
3 intervenes; provided, however, that amendments may be made to the time to which it is
4 proposed to adjourn, to take a recess or to postpone to a fixed time.
5 Rule 10. Motion to Adjourn. A motion to adjourn, to take a recess, or a motion
6 to adjourn to a time certain, shall always be in order, except when a member is speaking,
7 while a vote is being taken or when the Committee on Committees is reporting; subject,
8 however, to the limitations set out in Rule 9. A motion to adjourn or a motion to adjourn
9 to a time certain shall be taken by roll call vote, unless the motion is made after the
10 House has reached adjournment in the order of business under Rule 4, in which case
11 adjournment shall be by voice vote unless a roll call is ordered by a majority of the
12 members.
13 Rule 11. Motion to Table. The adoption of the motion to table, under these rules,
14 defeats the subject matter under consideration. The reconsideration of the motion to table
15 shall require approval of a majority of the members elected.
16 Rule 12. Previous Question. The previous question may be ordered by a three-
17 fifths majority of the members elected. [On the call of the roll, and subject to any motion
18 to limit debate, no member shall be allowed to speak more than two minutes to explain a
19 vote, and no more than one minute if the member has already spoken on the measure, and
20 shall not speak at all if the question is not a debatable question. ]The effect of the
21 previous question shall be to put an end to debate on any pending amendment; to prevent
22 the offering of additional amendments and to bring the House to an immediate vote upon
23 any amendment that has been called and is in order. Once the previous question has been
24 ordered, and any pending amendment has been voted upon, all debate shall cease and the
25 House shall immediately vote on the main question. In any case when the previous
26 question is ordered, no member shall be permitted to debate or explain their vote.
27 Rule 13. Motion to Set the Limits on Debate. A motion to set a time limit for
Page 5 of 46
XXXX 1/7/2025 12:14 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 812
1 debate on a measure, which may include a time limit for explanation of votes, in excess
2 of that permitted under Rule 12, shall be in order unless the previous question shall have
3 been ordered on the measure. The time limit set for debate and explanation of votes under
4 this rule shall be allotted by the Speaker evenly between the opponents of the measure
5 and the proponents of the measure. Adoption of a motion under this rule does not prevent
6 the offering of additional amendments.
7 Rule 14. Motion to Reconsider. A motion to reconsider a vote shall not be in
8 order unless made by a member who voted upon the prevailing side of the question, nor
9 shall that motion be in order unless made within two legislative days in which the House
10 is in session next after the date the vote was taken and the bill or resolution is in the
11 possession of the House; however, the motion to reconsider when coupled with the
12 additional motion to lay that motion upon the table may be made by any member. For
13 purposes of this rule, a member who is recorded as "not voting" on a proposition which
14 failed is considered to have voted on the prevailing side. Procedural motions, such as a
15 motion to lay on the table or lay on the clerk’s desk, shall not be subject to a motion to
16 reconsider.
17 Rule 15. Motion to Lay on Clerk’s Desk. The effect of the adoption of a motion
18 to lay on the Clerk’s desk under these rules is to place in charge of the Clerk the pending
19 question and everything adhering to it. A motion laid on the Clerk’s desk may be taken
20 from the desk and proceeded with at any time in the same order as when laid on the
21 Clerk’s desk.
22 Rule 16. Motion to Strike Out Enacting Clause. A motion to amend by striking
23 out the enacting words of a bill or resolution shall have precedence over a motion to
24 amend; and, if adopted, shall have the same effect as though the bill or resolution were
25 regularly voted upon and rejected.
26 Rule 17. Motion to Separate Part of a Measure. A motion to commit,
27 recommit, or postpone a part of a measure so as to separate that part of the measure from
Page 6 of 46

1 the remainder shall not be in order. A motion to divide a measure shall refer to and be
2 accompanied by an introduced House floor amendment.
3 Rule 18. Postponement of Measure. When a measure shall have been postponed
4 indefinitely it shall not be in order again during the session.
5 Rule 19. Reading of Pending Papers. Any pending bill, resolution, motion or
6 report shall be read upon the request of any member, with the concurrence of a majority
7 of the members elected to the House, but it shall not again be read on the same day unless
8 so ordered by the House.
9 Rule 20. Nominations. In all elections a previous nomination shall be made.
10 MEMBERS
11 Rule 21. Attendance of Members. No member shall be absent from a session of
12 the House without leave from the House. For the purposes of this rule, a member shall be
13 considered present if the member is in his or her Capitol Annex office during any session
14 when remote voting is authorized pursuant to House Rule 67A or if the member is in his
15 or her automobile on the Capitol Campus during any session when alternative voting is
16 authorized pursuant to House Rule 68A.
17 Rule 22. Decorum of Members. No member shall designate another member by
18 name. All members shall treat fellow members with the utmost courtesy and respect. All
19 members’ remarks in debate shall be confined to the subject under debate, avoiding
20 personality. A sign, poster, or any other object, the purpose of which can be reasonably
21 construed to indicate support or opposition to any measure before the House, and which
22 is large enough to be generally visible from the chair, shall not be displayed in the House
23 Chamber, or in a member’s Capitol Annex office during any session when remote voting
24 is authorized pursuant to House Rule 67A, by any member while the House is in session.
25 Rule 22A. Point of Personal Privilege. To be in order, a point of personal
26 privilege must relate to allegations regarding the rights, reputation, or conduct of a
27 member personally, in the member’s capacity as a representative, that, if true, would
Page 7 of 46
XXXX 1/7/2025 12:14 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 812
1 incapacitate them for membership. Members who have the floor after claiming a point of
2 personal privilege shall confine themselves to defending their own rights, reputations, or
3 conduct, and not those of other members. Members wishing to make general comments
4 about pending legislation, media coverage, or other matters that would be out of order if
5 raised as a point of personal privilege shall use Motions, Petitions, Communications, and
6 Announcements.
7 Rule 22B. Required Training. Each member of the House shall complete
8 workplace harassment prevention training at the beginning of each session of the General
9 Assembly.
10 Rule 23. Call to Order. If any member, in speech or otherwise, transgresses the
11 rules of order or decorum, the member shall immediately be called to order by the chair
12 and shall be seated. After hearing a short explanation from the member called to order, or
13 upon the withdrawal of the objectionable language, the Speaker may permit the member
14 to proceed, or may compel silence upon the member until the matter is disposed of. The
15 ruling of the chair shall be subject to an appeal to the House. A member offending the
16 House shall be liable to censure.
17 Rule 24. Debate. No member may speak more than once to the same subject until
18 all members desiring to be heard have spoken, but nothing in this rule shall do away with
19 the previous question if then in effect, nor permit debate on an undebatable motion.
20 No member shall speak more than thirty minutes in the aggregate on any question
21 or measure, at the end of which period, or any portion thereof, the floor shall be returned
22 to the Speaker.
23 Rule 25. Members Shall Vote at Seats. Except when remote voting is
24 authorized pursuant to House Rule 67A or alternative voting is authorized pursuant to
25 House Rule 68A, a member shall vote only when at the member’s seat or visibly
26 approaching it.

16 Voting System shall be reflected on the electrical voting system.
17 Rule 67B. Vote Modification. Following the close of any vote, a member may
18 only enter a new vote or modify a previously cast vote by motion, and only if the
19 member’s vote will not change the outcome of the original vote on the measure. If the
20 member’s motion is granted, the member shall file with the Clerk the vote the member
21 wishes the Clerk to enter or modify on a form provided by the Clerk, and the Clerk shall
22 thereafter enter upon the Journal the member’s new or modified vote; provided that no
23 vote cast or modified by motion under this rule shall amend an original roll call sheet.

12 matter pending before the House by advising the Speaker, the Clerk, or a designee of the
13 member’s caucus who will be physically present during a session of the House of the
14 member’s yea or nay vote on the matter.
15 Prior to the Speaker, the Clerk, or the caucus designee accepting and casting a vote
16 for another member, the Speaker, the Clerk, or the caucus designee shall verify the
17 member’s identity and desired vote on a specific measure under consideration through
18 appropriate means, including but not limited to a video call in which the member’s face

25 person, shall be reflected on the electrical voting system.

14 report, writing, article, booklet, pamphlet, image, photograph, object, or any other item,
15 including any physical object or electronic transmission containing audio, video, or
16 electronic communication, which is requested to be placed upon either the desk of a
17 member on the House floor or in a member’s office in the Annex. This material shall not
18 be distributed unless the party interested in the distribution of the material is clearly and
19 physically identified on the material to be distributed. All this material shall conform to
20 accepted public taste, shall contain no matter appealing to prurient interest or without
21 redeeming social value, and shall uphold the dignity of the legislative process. Material
22 originating from the general public shall be delivered to the administrative offices of the
23 Legislative Research Commission or the Clerk of the House and shall upon direction of
24 the Clerk, after inspection, be placed on the members’ desk in the Capitol Annex
25 provided the following conditions are met:
26 (1) Unless 100 copies are provided, all material should be individually addressed
27 to each member expected to receive a copy;

1 (2) If several pages or items are to be provided to each member, they should be
2 securely fastened or placed together in an envelope; and
3 (3) Sufficient copies of all material should be provided; staff shall not make
4 additional copies of material.
5 Material that may be distributed by the Clerk in the House Chamber is restricted to
6 official communications relating to pending legislation or the operation of the House,
7 material sent by a member clearly identified on the face of the material or its attachments
8 to any other member, or other material as designated by the Speaker’s Office. The
9 Sergeant-at-Arms shall be charged with the duty of ensuring that no individual other than
10 employees of the House under the direction of the Clerk or House members shall cause
11 materials of any nature to be distributed in the House Chamber. Members shall not
12 circumvent this rule by reading from materials in the House Chamber that do not
13 conform to this rule or that have not been distributed to all House members. Questions
14 as to the propriety of materials shall be referred to the Committee on Committees for
15 resolution. Any material distributed by unauthorized individuals shall be collected from
16 the members’ desks and treated as litter, and any material submitted but not distributed
17 that is unclaimed after one week shall be discarded. Material which is received via e-mail
18 or via any digital storage device or media with a request for distribution electronically by
19 LRC staff shall be refused or returned to the sender. Nothing in this rule restricts the right
20 of any person to communicate directly with any member, either electronically or through
21 the United States mail.
22 RULES
23 Rule 74. Mason’s Manual. In the absence of a specific rule of the House, the
24 most recent edition of Mason’s Manual of Legislative Procedure, as adopted by the
25 National Conference of State Legislatures, shall govern the proceedings, except that in all
26 cases where general parliamentary law provides for a rule of two-thirds, it shall mean in
27 this House a majority of all members elected thereto.

1 Rule 75. Change of Rules. The rules of the House, after their adoption shall not
2 be altered, changed, amended, suspended or interrupted, unless the same be done by a
3 majority of the members elected to the House. No rule shall be suspended for the purpose
4 of any action affecting the passage of a bill or resolution carrying the force of law unless
5 the rule is suspended by a majority of the members elected to the House. Whenever a rule
6 is suspended, no measure shall be considered under suspension except the measure or
7 measures in whose favor the suspension was invoked, and only for that day.
