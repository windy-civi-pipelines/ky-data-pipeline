14 student attendance day in the school term starting no earlier than the Monday
15 closest to August 26 may use a variable student instructional year. Districts

4 be required for all principals, guidance counselors, and teachers hired after

7 plan that permits teachers or other certified personnel within a school to
8 participate in professional development activities outside the days
9 scheduled in the school calendar or the regularly scheduled hours in the
10 school work day and receive credit towards the four (4) day professional
11 development requirement within the minimum one hundred eighty-five
12 (185) days that a teacher shall be employed.
13 2. A flexible schedule option shall be reflected in the school's professional
14 development component within the school improvement plan and
15 approved by the local board. Credit for approved professional
16 development activities may be accumulated in periods of time other than
17 full day segments.
18 3. No teacher or administrator shall be permitted to count participation in a
19 professional development activity under the flexible schedule option
20 unless the activity is related to the teacher's classroom assignment and
21 content area, or the administrator's job requirements, or is required by
22 the school improvement plan, or is tied to the teacher's or the
23 administrator's individual growth plan. The supervisor shall give prior
24 approval and shall monitor compliance with the requirements of this
25 paragraph. In the case of teachers, a professional development
26 committee or the school council by council policy may be responsible
27 for reviewing requests for approval.
