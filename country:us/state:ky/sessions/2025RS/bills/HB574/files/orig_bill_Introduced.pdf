19 (1) (a) Upon receipt of a report alleging abuse or neglect of a child as defined in KRS
20 600.020 by a parent, guardian, fictive kin, person in a position of authority,
21 person in a position of special trust, or person exercising custodial control or
22 supervision, pursuant to KRS 620.030(1) or (2), [or ]a report alleging a child
23 is a victim of human trafficking pursuant to KRS 620.030(3), or a report that
24 a child has been born to a parent who has another child in the care,
25 custody, or control of the cabinet or other person as a result of removal
26 pursuant to this chapter, the recipient of the report shall immediately notify
27 the cabinet or its designated representative, the local law enforcement agency
Page 4 of 22
XXXX 2/13/2025 5:22 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1085
1 or the Department of Kentucky State Police, and the Commonwealth's or
2 county attorney of the receipt of the report. If any agency listed above is the
3 reporting source, the recipient shall immediately notify the cabinet or its
4 designated representative, the local law enforcement agency, the Department
5 of Kentucky State Police, and the Commonwealth's or county attorney of the
6 receipt of the report.
7 (b) Based upon the allegation in the report, the cabinet shall immediately make an
8 initial determination as to the risk of harm and immediate safety of the child.
9 Based upon the level of risk determined, the cabinet shall investigate the
10 allegation or accept the report for an assessment of family needs and, if
11 appropriate, may provide or make referral to any community-based services
12 necessary to reduce risk to the child and to provide family support. A report of
13 sexual abuse or human trafficking of a child shall be considered high risk and
14 shall not be referred to any other community agency.
15 (c) 1. There is a rebuttable presumption that a child born to a parent who
16 has another child in the care, custody, or control of the cabinet or
17 other person as a result of removal pursuant to this chapter is in
18 immediate danger of dependency, neglect, or abuse, and the cabinet
19 shall immediately make an initial determination as to the risk of harm
20 and immediate safety of the child. If the cabinet does not locate the
21 child within fourteen (14) days to make the initial determination, the
22 cabinet shall contact local law enforcement to assist in locating the
23 child. If the cabinet determines that the presumption has been
24 rebutted, either due to the fact that the parent is successfully
25 participating in cabinet- or court-directed services or due to other
26 reasons, and the child is not subject to an immediate threat to the
27 child's health or safety, the cabinet shall maintain a record of the
Page 5 of 22
XXXX 2/13/2025 5:22 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1085
1 determination; the previous allegations, complaints, or petitions
2 against the parent; and the evidence rebutting the presumption to have
3 an additional level of review by the Commissioner of the Department
4 for Community Based Services within the cabinet or designee.
5 2. Following removal of a child from the custody of the child's parent
6 after an investigation required by this paragraph, the cabinet shall not
7 return the child to the parent's custody unless:
8 a. A guardian ad litem has been appointed for the child;
9 b. A full investigation has been conducted by the department as
10 required by this section, and the results of the investigation,
11 including any previous allegations, complaints, or petitions of
12 dependency, neglect, or abuse against the parent, have been
13 presented to the court at a hearing to determine whether the
14 child is dependent, neglected, or abused; and
15 c. The court determines by a preponderance of evidence that the
16 child will be provided a safe home.
17 (d) In making the initial determination as to the risk of harm and immediate
18 safety of the child pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subsection, the cabinet
19 shall at a minimum:
20 1. Consider the age and vulnerability of a child, particularly for ages five
21 (5) years of age and under, when assessing allegations of abuse and
22 neglect;
23 2. Automatically accept for investigation a subsequent report from a
24 professional reporting source, who makes a report pursuant to the
25 requirements in KRS Chapter 620 that a child is abused or neglected and
26 identifies himself or herself by name, title, and employer, when the same
27 or similar allegation has been reported by one (1) or more unique

2 purposes of this subparagraph "professional reporting source" means an
3 individual who is a social worker, therapist, medical professional,
4 educator, judge, attorney, law enforcement officer, or any other
5 individual holding a degree or position in a field related to the safety and
6 care of children; and
7 3. Automatically accept for investigation a report from a court of
8 appropriate jurisdiction that makes a report pursuant to the requirements
9 in KRS Chapter 620 that a child is abused or neglected or identifies that
10 the child is a plaintiff in an active emergency protective order or
11 interpersonal protection order case.
12 (e)[(d)] The cabinet shall, within seventy-two (72) hours, exclusive of weekends
13 and holidays, make a written report, including but not limited to electronic
14 submissions, to the Commonwealth's or county attorney and the local law
15 enforcement agency or the Department of Kentucky State Police concerning
16 the action that has been taken on the investigation.
17 (f)[(e)] If the report alleges abuse or neglect by someone other than a parent,
18 guardian, fictive kin, person in a position of authority, person in a position of
19 special trust, or person exercising custodial control or supervision, or the
20 human trafficking of a child, the cabinet shall immediately notify the
21 Commonwealth's or county attorney and the local law enforcement agency or
22 the Department of Kentucky State Police.
23 (2) (a) Upon receipt of a report alleging dependency pursuant to KRS 620.030(1) and
24 (2), the recipient shall immediately notify the cabinet or its designated

3 of reports made under this subsection unless the report involves the human
4 trafficking of a child, in which case the notification shall be required.
5 (3) If the cabinet or its designated representative receives a report of abuse by a person
6 other than a parent, guardian, fictive kin, person in a position of authority, person in
7 a position of special trust, or other person exercising custodial control or
8 supervision of a child, it shall immediately notify the local law enforcement agency
9 or the Department of Kentucky State Police and the Commonwealth's or county
10 attorney of the receipt of the report and its contents, and they shall investigate the

16 (4) School personnel or other persons listed in KRS 620.030(2) do not have the
17 authority to conduct internal investigations in lieu of the official investigations
18 outlined in this section.
19 (5) (a) If, after receiving the report, the law enforcement officer, the cabinet, or its

25 removed by the law enforcement officer.
26 (b) If a child who is in a hospital or under the immediate care of a physician

5 (c) Any appropriate law enforcement officer may take a child into protective
6 custody and may hold that child in protective custody without the consent of
7 the parent or other person exercising custodial control or supervision if there
8 exist reasonable grounds for the officer to believe that the child is in danger of
9 imminent death or serious physical injury, is being sexually abused, or is a
10 victim of human trafficking and that the parents or other person exercising
11 custodial control or supervision are unable or unwilling to protect the child.
12 The officer or the person to whom the officer entrusts the child shall, within

16 child into custody without the consent of the parent or other person exercising
17 custodial control or supervision, he or she shall provide written notice to the
18 parent or other person stating the reasons for removal of the child. Failure of
19 the parent or other person to receive notice shall not, by itself, be cause for
20 civil or criminal liability.
21 (e) 1. If a report includes a child fatality or near fatality, and the law
22 enforcement officer has reasonable grounds to believe any parent or
23 person exercising custodial control or supervision of the child was under
24 the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time the fatality or near fatality
25 occurred, the law enforcement officer shall request a test of blood,
26 breath, or urine from that person.
27 2. If, after making the request, consent is not given for the test of blood,
Page 10 of 22

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1085

2 issued by the judge to the appropriate law enforcement official upon
3 probable cause that a child fatality or near fatality has occurred and that
4 the person exercising custodial control or supervision of the child at the
5 time of the fatality or near fatality was under the influence.
6 3. Any test requested under this section shall be conducted pursuant to the
7 testing procedures and requirements in KRS 189A.103.
8 (6) The cabinet shall make efforts as soon as practicable to determine any military
9 status of a parent or legal guardian of a child who is the subject of an investigation
10 or assessment pursuant to this section. If the cabinet determines that the parent or
11 legal guardian is a member of the United States Armed Forces, the cabinet shall
12 notify the Department of Defense family advocacy program operating within the
13 service member's assigned installation of the investigation or assessment and
14 provide case information.
15 (7) To the extent practicable and when in the best interest of a child alleged to have
16 been abused, interviews with the child shall be conducted at a children's advocacy
17 center.
18 (8) (a) One (1) or more multidisciplinary teams may be established in every county

9 abuse or child human trafficking cases involving commercial sexual activity
10 are received or if active cases exist. At each meeting, each active case shall be
11 presented and the agencies' responses assessed.

21 (3) Neither the husband-wife nor any professional-client/patient privilege, except the

7 medical diagnostic procedures may be introduced into evidence in any subsequent
8 judicial proceedings or an administrative hearing conducted by the cabinet or its
9 designee in accordance with KRS Chapter 13B in an appeal of a cabinet-

27 (1) The court for the county where the child ordinarily resides or will reside or the
Page 19 of 22
XXXX 2/13/2025 5:22 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1085
1 county where the child is present may issue an ex parte emergency custody order
2 when it appears to the court that removal is in the best interest of the child and that
3 there are reasonable grounds to believe, as supported by affidavit or by recorded
4 sworn testimony, that one (1) or more of the following conditions exist and that the
5 parents or other person exercising custodial control or supervision are unable or
6 unwilling to protect the child:
7 (a) The child is in danger of imminent death or serious physical injury or is being
8 sexually abused;
9 (b) The parent has repeatedly inflicted or allowed to be inflicted by other than
10 accidental means physical injury or emotional injury. This condition shall not
11 include reasonable and ordinary discipline recognized in the community
12 where the child lives, as long as reasonable and ordinary discipline does not
13 result in abuse or neglect as defined in KRS 600.020(1);[ or]
14 (c) The child is in immediate danger due to the parent's failure or refusal to
15 provide for the safety or needs of the child; or
16 (d) The parent or other person exercising custodial control or supervision has
17 another child in the care, custody, or control of the cabinet or other person
18 as a result a removal pursuant to this chapter, creating a rebuttable
19 presumption that the child is in immediate danger of dependency, neglect,
20 or abuse.
21 (2) Custody may be placed with a relative taking into account the wishes of the
22 custodial parent and child or any other appropriate person or agency including the
23 cabinet.
24 (3) An emergency custody order shall be effective no longer than seventy-two (72)
25 hours, exclusive of weekends and holidays, unless there is a temporary removal
26 hearing with oral or other notice to the county attorney and the parent or other
27 person exercising custodial control or supervision of the child, to determine if the
Page 20 of 22

1 child should be held for a longer period. The seventy-two (72) hour period also may
2 be extended or delayed upon the waiver or request of the child's parent or other
3 person exercising custodial control or supervision.
4 (4) Any person authorized to serve process shall serve the parent or other person
5 exercising custodial control or supervision with a copy of the emergency custody
6 order. If such person cannot be found, the sheriff shall make a good faith effort to
7 notify the nearest known relative, neighbor, or other person familiar with the child.
8 (5) Within seventy-two (72) hours of the taking of a child into custody without the
9 consent of his or her parent or other person exercising custodial control or
10 supervision, a petition shall be filed pursuant to this chapter.
11 (6) Nothing herein shall preclude the issuance of arrest warrants pursuant to the Rules
12 of Criminal Procedure.
13 Section 5. KRS 620.080 is amended to read as follows:
14 (1) Unless waived by the child and his or her parent or other person exercising
15 custodial control or supervision, a temporary removal hearing shall be held:
16 (a) Within seventy-two (72) hours, excluding weekends and holidays, of the time
17 when an emergency custody order is issued or when a child is taken into
18 custody without the consent of his or her parent or other person exercising
19 custodial control or supervision; and
20 (b) In cases commenced by the filing of a petition, within ten (10) days of the
21 date of filing.
22 (2) At a temporary removal hearing, the court shall determine whether there are
23 reasonable grounds to believe that the child would be dependent, neglected or
24 abused if returned to or left in the custody of his or her parent or other person
25 exercising custodial control or supervision even though it is not proved
26 conclusively who has perpetrated the dependency, neglect or abuse. For good cause,
27 the court may allow hearsay evidence. The Commonwealth shall bear the burden of
Page 21 of 22

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1085
1 proof by a preponderance of the evidence and if the Commonwealth should fail to
2 establish same, the child shall be released to or retained in the custody of his or her
3 parent or other person exercising custodial control or supervision.
4 (3) There is a rebuttable presumption that the child would be dependent, neglected,
5 or abused if returned to or left in the custody of his or her parent or other person
6 exercising custodial control or supervision if the parent or other person
7 exercising custodial control or supervision has another child in the care, custody,
8 or control of the cabinet or other person as a result of removal pursuant to this
9 chapter.
