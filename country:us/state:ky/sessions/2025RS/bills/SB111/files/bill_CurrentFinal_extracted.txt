15 Developmental and Intellectual Disabilities;

21 hospital, that is licensed pursuant to KRS Chapter 216B to provide inpatient

1 admission, undergo a behavioral assessment by a clinical professional to

22 Juvenile Justice or at a location specified by the department if the
23 child is in the custody of the cabinet; and
24 3. Contact information from the inpatient psychiatric hospital or

1 determined in the best interest of the child that the child should
2 receive psychiatric services other than inpatient treatment services.
3 (4) (a) If the representative of the department and the representative of the
4 Department of Juvenile Justice agree with the recommendations of the

14 objection, and may include a recommendation for an alternate plan, facility,
15 or assessment. The dissenting affidavit shall be signed by a physician who

19 court shall enter an order regarding the course of treatment or may schedule a
20 hearing to determine a treatment plan for the high acuity youth.

Page 3 of 52

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS SB 111/GA
1 patients and staff. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require an
2 inpatient psychiatric hospital or pediatric teaching hospital to admit a child if
3 doing so would be in violation of federal law.

5 admission of a high acuity youth to an inpatient psychiatric hospital or
6 pediatric teaching hospital, then the provision of inpatient services by the
7 inpatient psychiatric hospital or pediatric teaching hospital shall be

12 treatment of high acuity youth, the provisions of KRS 202A.271
13 notwithstanding.
14 (b) For any admission under this subsection, the inpatient psychiatric hospital

24 during the period of treatment.

26 teaching hospital for treatment pursuant to a court order issued under this
27 section, and the high acuity youth commits an act of violence or incites violence

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS SB 111/GA
1 against any of the hospital's patients, staff, or visitors, the inpatient psychiatric
2 hospital or pediatric teaching hospital may file an affidavit with the department

4 Justice, as applicable, and with the court, and the youth shall be:
5 (a) Charged criminally;
6 (b) Discharged from the hospital; and
7 (c) Immediately returned to the youth's last place of custody or residence unless
8 another location is ordered by the court.
9 (9) If the treatment plan approved or ordered by the court involves the provision of
10 outpatient psychiatric services to the high acuity youth at the location of a
11 detention facility, then the department or the Department of Juvenile Justice may
12 contract with an inpatient psychiatric hospital or pediatric teaching hospital to
13 provide the outpatient psychiatric services. The inpatient psychiatric hospital or
14 pediatric teaching hospital shall be reimbursed by the Department for Medicaid
15 Services for such outpatient psychiatric services at no less than one hundred fifty
16 percent (150%) of the then current inpatient psychiatric hospital's or pediatric
17 teaching hospital's Medicaid reimbursement rate as if such services had been
18 performed in an inpatient setting, the provisions of KRS 202A.271
19 notwithstanding.
20 (10) Each inpatient psychiatric hospital or pediatric teaching hospital that accepts any
21 high acuity youth under this section, the cabinet, the department, the Department
22 of Juvenile Justice, and the Court of Justice shall adopt and provide a protocol
23 for twenty-four (24) hour access to comply with the requirements of this section.
24 (11) When a high acuity youth has received residential treatment and the treatment
25 has improved the youth's condition to a status that the need for continued
26 treatment at that facility is no longer medically indicated as determined by the
27 treating physician:

SB011110.100 - 432 - XXXX 2/19/2025 3:06 PM GA

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS SB 111/GA
1 (a) If the youth has a need for the continuum of care on an inpatient basis in
2 an inpatient psychiatric hospital, pediatric teaching hospital, or other
3 inpatient facility equipped to treat a high acuity youth, the Department for
4 Juvenile Justice, the department, and a representative of the inpatient
5 psychiatric hospital, pediatric teaching hospital, or other inpatient facility to
6 which the youth may be transferred shall proceed in accordance with
7 subsections (3), (4), and (5) of this section;
8 (b) Any additional medical care that the youth may need as part of a continuum
9 of care that requires a transfer to another facility for treatment shall also
10 proceed in accordance with subsections (3), (4), and (5) of this section; and
11 (c) As part of the continuum of care, the same representatives from the
12 department and the Department of Juvenile Justice who have evaluated and
13 provided treatment and recommendations for the youth shall, to the extent
14 possible, continue to review the medical treatment of the youth to provide
15 stability of care with the goal of improving the life and health of the youth.
16 (12) In the event a high acuity youth is delivered to an inpatient psychiatric hospital or
17 pediatric teaching hospital for a behavioral assessment without referral by the
18 department, the cabinet, or the Department of Juvenile Justice, the clinical
19 professional may present the affidavit referenced in subsection (3) of this section
20 to a law enforcement officer, a court designated worker, or a detention alternative
21 coordinator who shall then return the youth to the custody of the custodial
22 agency until such time as a court issues further orders regarding the appropriate
23 treatment for the high acuity youth. The inpatient psychiatric hospital or
24 pediatric teaching hospital shall then proceed according to subsections (3), (4),
25 and (5) of this section.
