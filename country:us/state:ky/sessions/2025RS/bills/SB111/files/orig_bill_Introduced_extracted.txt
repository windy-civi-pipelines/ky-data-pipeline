8 clinical records;
9 (b) "Clinical professional" means a licensed clinician employed by, or

13 teaching hospital for inpatient psychiatric care;
14 (c) "Department" means the Department for Behavioral Health,
15 Developmental and Intellectual Disabilities;
16 (d) "High acuity youth" means a child who has been determined by a clinical
17 professional, following a behavioral assessment, to need an environment
18 and specialized treatment capable of addressing manifest aggression,
19 violence toward persons, or property destruction;

21 hospital, that is licensed pursuant to KRS Chapter 216B to provide inpatient
22 psychiatric services; and

1 admission, undergo a behavioral assessment by a clinical professional to
2 determine whether the child qualifies as a high acuity youth.
3 (3) (a) If a clinical professional determines that the child qualifies as a high acuity

5 contact the:
6 1. Designated representative of the department or other designated
7 representative of the cabinet; and
8 2. Designated representative of the Department of Juvenile Justice;
9 to discuss the immediate treatment plan for the child.
10 (b) The clinical professional shall prepare an affidavit, with any documents in
11 support of the affidavit, for submission to the department, the Department
12 of Juvenile Justice, and the court. The affidavit shall include:
13 1. A summary of the clinical evidence that the clinical professional relied
14 upon for the determination that the child qualifies as a high acuity
15 youth;
16 2. A recommendation of the appropriate location for any recommended
17 treatment services for the high acuity youth and the basis for the
18 recommendation, based upon the child's needs and the capabilities of
19 the inpatient psychiatric hospital or pediatric teaching hospital, or
20 whether treatment on an outpatient basis may be provided at a
21 detention facility for a child in the custody of the Department of
22 Juvenile Justice or at a location specified by the department if the
23 child is in the custody of the cabinet; and
24 3. Contact information from the inpatient psychiatric hospital or

1 determined in the best interest of the child that the child should
2 receive psychiatric services other than inpatient treatment services.
3 (4) (a) If the representative of the department and the representative of the
4 Department of Juvenile Justice agree with the recommendations of the
5 clinical professional, a conference affidavit establishing an initial treatment
6 plan shall be submitted to the court on a form provided by the

12 shall submit an affidavit of dissent to the court on a form provided by the
13 Administrative Office of the Courts that states the clinical basis for the
14 objection, and may include a recommendation for an alternate plan, facility,
15 or assessment. The dissenting affidavit shall be signed by a physician who
16 can speak directly to the clinical basis for submitting the dissenting
17 affidavit.
18 (5) Following submission of a conference affidavit or an affidavit of dissent, the
19 court shall enter an order regarding the course of treatment or may schedule a
20 hearing to determine a treatment plan for the high acuity youth.
21 (6) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the court shall not order a high
22 acuity youth for inpatient treatment within an inpatient psychiatric hospital or
23 pediatric teaching hospital without agreement of the hospital, the department,
24 and the Department of Juvenile Justice unless the court determines by clear and
25 convincing evidence that the inpatient psychiatric hospital or pediatric teaching
26 hospital has the resources and capabilities to treat the high acuity youth in a
27 manner that does not pose a danger to the high acuity youth or the hospital's
Page 3 of 53

1 patients and staff. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require an
2 inpatient psychiatric hospital or pediatric teaching hospital to admit a child if
3 doing so would be in violation of federal law.
4 (7) (a) If the treatment plan approved or ordered by the court involves the
5 admission of a high acuity youth to an inpatient psychiatric hospital or
6 pediatric teaching hospital, then the provision of inpatient services by the
7 inpatient psychiatric hospital or pediatric teaching hospital shall be
8 reimbursed by the Department of Medicaid Services at no less than two
9 hundred percent (200%) of the then current inpatient psychiatric hospital's
10 or pediatric teaching hospital's Medicaid inpatient rate to account for the
11 acuity and intensity of health care items and services necessary for
12 treatment of high acuity youth, the provisions of KRS 202A.271
13 notwithstanding.
14 (b) For any admission under this subsection, the inpatient psychiatric hospital
15 or pediatric teaching hospital shall provide:

17 needed, within ten (10) days from the filing of the initial affidavit; and
18 2. Status reports to the department or the Department of Juvenile
19 Justice, as applicable, upon request or as ordered by the court.
20 (c) Any dispute that arises between the inpatient psychiatric hospital or

22 Justice shall be resolved in the manner provided in subsections (3), (4), and
23 (5) of this section, and any party may request court review at any time
24 during the period of treatment.
25 (8) If a high acuity youth is admitted to an inpatient psychiatric hospital or pediatric
26 teaching hospital for treatment pursuant to a court order issued under this
27 section, and the high acuity youth commits an act of violence or incites violence

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 432
1 against any of the hospital's patients, staff, or visitors, the inpatient psychiatric
2 hospital or pediatric teaching hospital may file an affidavit with the department
3 or other designated representative of the cabinet, or the Department of Juvenile
4 Justice, as applicable, and with the court, and the youth shall be:
5 (a) Charged criminally;
6 (b) Discharged from the hospital; and
7 (c) Immediately returned to the youth's last place of custody or residence unless
8 another location is ordered by the court.
9 (9) If the treatment plan approved or ordered by the court involves the provision of
10 outpatient psychiatric services to the high acuity youth at the location of a
11 detention facility, then the department or the Department of Juvenile Justice may
12 contract with an inpatient psychiatric hospital or pediatric teaching hospital to
13 provide the outpatient psychiatric services. The inpatient psychiatric hospital or
14 pediatric teaching hospital shall be reimbursed by the Department for Medicaid
15 Services for such outpatient psychiatric services at no less than one hundred fifty
16 percent (150%) of the then current inpatient psychiatric hospital's or pediatric
17 teaching hospital's Medicaid reimbursement rate as if such services had been
18 performed in an inpatient setting, the provisions of KRS 202A.271
19 notwithstanding.
20 (10) Each inpatient psychiatric hospital or pediatric teaching hospital that accepts any
21 high acuity youth under this section, the cabinet, the department, the Department
22 of Juvenile Justice, and the Court of Justice shall adopt and provide a protocol
23 for twenty-four (24) hour access to comply with the requirements of this section.
24 (11) When a high acuity youth has received residential treatment and the treatment
25 has improved the youth's condition to a status that the need for continued
26 treatment at that facility is no longer medically indicated as determined by the
27 treating physician:

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 432
1 (a) If the youth has a need for the continuum of care on an inpatient basis in
2 an inpatient psychiatric hospital, pediatric teaching hospital, or other
3 inpatient facility equipped to treat a high acuity youth, the Department for
4 Juvenile Justice, the department, and a representative of the inpatient
5 psychiatric hospital, pediatric teaching hospital, or other inpatient facility to
6 which the youth may be transferred shall proceed in accordance with
7 subsections (3), (4), and (5) of this section;
8 (b) Any additional medical care that the youth may need as part of a continuum
9 of care that requires a transfer to another facility for treatment shall also
10 proceed in accordance with subsections (3), (4), and (5) of this section; and
11 (c) As part of the continuum of care, the same representatives from the
12 department and the Department of Juvenile Justice who have evaluated and
13 provided treatment and recommendations for the youth shall, to the extent
14 possible, continue to review the medical treatment of the youth to provide
15 stability of care with the goal of improving the life and health of the youth.
16 (12) In the event a high acuity youth is delivered to an inpatient psychiatric hospital or
17 pediatric teaching hospital for a behavioral assessment without referral by the
18 department, the cabinet, or the Department of Juvenile Justice, the clinical
19 professional may present the affidavit referenced in subsection (3) of this section
20 to a law enforcement officer, a court designated worker, or a detention alternative
21 coordinator who shall then return the youth to the custody of the custodial
22 agency until such time as a court issues further orders regarding the appropriate
23 treatment for the high acuity youth. The inpatient psychiatric hospital or
24 pediatric teaching hospital shall then proceed according to subsections (3), (4),
25 and (5) of this section.
26 Section 2. KRS 15A.305 is amended to read as follows:
27 (1) (a) The Department of Juvenile Justice shall[ develop and] administer a
