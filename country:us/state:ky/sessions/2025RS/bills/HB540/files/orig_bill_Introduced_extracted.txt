1 government for any other health care coverage shall be paid by the employee.
2 (4) If an employee moves his or her place of residence or employment out of the
3 service area of an insurer offering a managed health care plan, under which he or
4 she has elected coverage, into either the service area of another managed health care
5 plan or into an area of the Commonwealth not within a managed health care plan
6 service area, the employee shall be given an option, at the time of the move or
7 transfer, to change his or her coverage to another health benefit plan.
8 (5) No payment of premium by any department, board, agency, public postsecondary
9 educational institution, or branch of state, city, urban-county, charter county,
10 county, or consolidated local government shall constitute compensation to an
11 insured employee for the purposes of any statute fixing or limiting the
12 compensation of such an employee. Any premium or other expense incurred by any
