1 As used in Sections 1 to 4 of this Act:
2 (1) "Boy" means a human male who is a legal minor under Kentucky law;
3 (2) "Equal" does not mean same or identical with respect to equality of the sexes;
4 (3) "Female," when used in reference to a natural person, means an individual who:
5 (a) Has, had, or will have through the course of normal development; or
6 (b) Would have but for a developmental anomaly, genetic anomaly, or accident;
7 the reproductive system that at some point produces ova;
8 (4) "Girl" means a human female who is a legal minor under Kentucky law;
9 (5) "Male," when used in reference to a natural person, means an individual who:
10 (a) Has, had, or will have through the course of normal development; or
11 (b) Would have but for a developmental anomaly, genetic anomaly, or accident;
12 the reproductive system that at some point produces sperm;
13 (6) "Man" means an adult human of the male sex;
14 (7) (a) "Sex," when used in reference to a natural person:
15 1. Refers to the biological sex of either male or female as observed or
16 clinically verified at birth;
17 2. Is objective and fixed; and
18 3. Does not include gender identity or any other terms intended to convey
19 a person's subjective sense of self. Gender identity and other subjective

22 Individuals with differences in sex development, or DSD, sometimes

4 males or females in relation to similarly situated members of the opposite sex. It
5 shall not be construed to prohibit separation of the sexes in the interest of
6 maintaining safety, privacy, and fairness as specified in this section.
7 (2) (a) Because the Commonwealth of Kentucky has an important interest in
8 preventing unjust discrimination and in maintaining safety, privacy, and
9 fairness, the Commonwealth and its political subdivisions and
10 instrumentalities may provide single-sex environments for males and
11 females where the sexes are not similarly situated, particularly with respect
12 to biology.
13 (b) As illustrative, non-exhaustive examples, public entities in the
14 Commonwealth may distinguish between the sexes with respect to prisons
15 and other detention centers, athletics, living facilities, locker rooms,
16 bathrooms, domestic violence shelters, and rape crisis centers without
17 violating antidiscrimination mandates.
