UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1496
2 WHEREAS, prenatal testing has become increasingly routine, leading more parents
3 to receive devastating news before their babies are born; and

5 have outpaced the capacity to care for pregnant women and birth fathers, babies, and
6 family members facing pregnancy complications and life-limiting conditions; and
7 WHEREAS, perinatal palliative care presents an innovative and compassionate
8 model of support for pregnant women and birth fathers, babies, and family members
9 following a prenatal diagnosis indicating a life-limiting condition; and
10 WHEREAS, perinatal palliative care offers alternatives for pregnant women and
11 birth fathers faced with nonviable pregnancies or infants whose diagnoses suggest a brief
12 life after birth, recognizing the value and dignity of these babies; and
13 WHEREAS, perinatal palliative care accompanies pregnant women, birth fathers,
14 and family members on their journey through pregnancy, birth, and death, honoring both
15 the babies and their family members; and
16 WHEREAS, perinatal palliative care provides essential support for pregnant
17 women, birth fathers, and family members experiencing pregnancies with babies
18 expected to die before or shortly after birth; and
19 WHEREAS, perinatal palliative care is not confined to a specific location but may
20 be offered in many contexts; and

22 involved with a pregnancy that are marked by dignity, compassion, and love; and

24 emotional, and spiritual supports as alternatives to pregnancy termination and consider
25 the psychological and faith challenges associated with post-termination; and

27 personal and intimate process that may include putting care requests in writing to ensure

1 wishes are clear, which may provide a sense of control in situations where many people
2 may feel heartbroken and out of control; and
3 WHEREAS, although a profoundly sad period, perinatal palliative care can assist
4 pregnant mothers in crafting a birth plan for an expected end-of-life birth that allows

6 entrance into the world; and
7 WHEREAS, perinatal palliative care can be seamlessly integrated into standard
8 pregnancy and birth care in any setting; and
9 WHEREAS, perinatal palliative care services encompass support throughout

12 treatment plans, and pain relief for babies, if necessary; guidance for planning memorial
13 or funeral services; and provision of social and spiritual support for pregnant women,
14 birth fathers, and family members; and
15 WHEREAS, perinatal palliative care represents a beautiful and practical response to
16 support pregnant women, birth fathers, and family members when perinatal testing
17 reveals an expectation of the baby dying before or shortly after birth that allows them to
18 embrace the time they have with their baby with compassion and support; and
19 WHEREAS, it is critical that public and private insurers in the Commonwealth of
20 Kentucky include coverage for perinatal palliative care as part of their package of health
21 benefits; and

23 and Gynecologists' Committees on Obstetric Practice and Ethics expresses support for
24 perinatal palliative care as a coordinated care strategy that comprises options for obstetric
25 and newborn care that include a focus on maximizing quality of life and comfort for
26 newborns with a variety of conditions considered to be life-limiting in early infancy and a
27 dual focus on ameliorating suffering and honoring patient values, perinatal palliative care

6 Cabinet deems the bids submitted in accordance with this subsection to be in
7 the best interests of state employees in a region, the cabinet may award the
8 contract for that region to no more than two (2) carriers; and
9 (e) Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit the Personnel Cabinet from including
10 other requirements or criteria in the request for proposal.

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1496
1 AN ACT relating to perinatal palliative care.
2 WHEREAS, prenatal testing has become increasingly routine, leading more parents
3 to receive devastating news before their babies are born; and
4 WHEREAS, in numerous instances, the abilities of prenatal and perinatal diagnosis
5 have outpaced the capacity to care for pregnant women and birth fathers, babies, and
6 family members facing pregnancy complications and life-limiting conditions; and
7 WHEREAS, perinatal palliative care presents an innovative and compassionate
8 model of support for pregnant women and birth fathers, babies, and family members
9 following a prenatal diagnosis indicating a life-limiting condition; and
10 WHEREAS, perinatal palliative care offers alternatives for pregnant women and
11 birth fathers faced with nonviable pregnancies or infants whose diagnoses suggest a brief
12 life after birth, recognizing the value and dignity of these babies; and
13 WHEREAS, perinatal palliative care accompanies pregnant women, birth fathers,
14 and family members on their journey through pregnancy, birth, and death, honoring both
15 the babies and their family members; and
16 WHEREAS, perinatal palliative care provides essential support for pregnant
17 women, birth fathers, and family members experiencing pregnancies with babies
18 expected to die before or shortly after birth; and
19 WHEREAS, perinatal palliative care is not confined to a specific location but may
20 be offered in many contexts; and
21 WHEREAS, perinatal palliative care offers extraordinary ways of caring for all
22 involved with a pregnancy that are marked by dignity, compassion, and love; and
23 WHEREAS, perinatal palliative care programs integrate multidisciplinary medical,
24 emotional, and spiritual supports as alternatives to pregnancy termination and consider
25 the psychological and faith challenges associated with post-termination; and
26 WHEREAS, engaging in a perinatal palliative care approach often involves a
27 personal and intimate process that may include putting care requests in writing to ensure
Page 1 of 22

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1496
1 wishes are clear, which may provide a sense of control in situations where many people
2 may feel heartbroken and out of control; and
3 WHEREAS, although a profoundly sad period, perinatal palliative care can assist
4 pregnant mothers in crafting a birth plan for an expected end-of-life birth that allows
5 them to parent their babies and orchestrate the precious time surrounding their babies'
6 entrance into the world; and
7 WHEREAS, perinatal palliative care can be seamlessly integrated into standard
8 pregnancy and birth care in any setting; and
9 WHEREAS, perinatal palliative care services encompass support throughout
10 pregnancy, delivery, and the postpartum period, and may include guidance on medical
11 decisions; assistance in creating memories, keepsakes, personalized birth plans, initial
12 treatment plans, and pain relief for babies, if necessary; guidance for planning memorial
13 or funeral services; and provision of social and spiritual support for pregnant women,
14 birth fathers, and family members; and
15 WHEREAS, perinatal palliative care represents a beautiful and practical response to
16 support pregnant women, birth fathers, and family members when perinatal testing
17 reveals an expectation of the baby dying before or shortly after birth that allows them to
18 embrace the time they have with their baby with compassion and support; and
19 WHEREAS, it is critical that public and private insurers in the Commonwealth of
20 Kentucky include coverage for perinatal palliative care as part of their package of health
21 benefits; and
22 WHEREAS, the 2024 committee opinion of the American College of Obstetricians
23 and Gynecologists' Committees on Obstetric Practice and Ethics expresses support for
24 perinatal palliative care as a coordinated care strategy that comprises options for obstetric
25 and newborn care that include a focus on maximizing quality of life and comfort for
26 newborns with a variety of conditions considered to be life-limiting in early infancy and a
27 dual focus on ameliorating suffering and honoring patient values, perinatal palliative care
