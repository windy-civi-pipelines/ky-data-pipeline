6 comprising the city of the first class with respect to personal property, health
7 insurance premiums, or both, and shall contract with the consolidated local
8 government to pay all sums collected to the consolidated local government, in
9 return for the provision of services performed by the consolidated local government
10 within the area formerly comprising the city of the first class which services are in

18 government, the boundaries of the district may be modified in the following
19 manner. The proposal to alter the boundaries of the urban service tax district within

22 approve a reduction in the required minimum capital investment to an amount not
23 less than one hundred fifty million dollars ($150,000,000), subject to a
24 corresponding adjustment of the maximum incremental revenue available for
25 recovery as appropriate, based upon the recommendation of the consultant who

27 Section 4. KRS 154.30-060 is amended to read as follows:

10 described in this chapter for taxes and services within the area comprising the

4 The ordinance shall provide that the board of the tax district shall receive the
5 income derived from the differential tax rate applicable in the area formerly
6 comprising the city of the first class with respect to personal property, health
7 insurance premiums, or both, and shall contract with the consolidated local
8 government to pay all sums collected to the consolidated local government, in
9 return for the provision of services performed by the consolidated local government

6 from, as the case may be, the urban service tax district shall then be placed upon the
7 ballot in the precincts in the area to be added or deleted at the next regular election
8 and the question stated on the ballot shall be so phrased that a "Yes" vote shall be
9 cast in favor of making the proposed change and a "No" vote shall be cast to oppose
10 the proposed change. If a majority of those voting in those precincts support the
11 change, then the change in the boundaries of the urban service tax district shall be
12 implemented.
13 (5) (a) No later than July 1, 2025, the consolidated local government shall reimburse
14 a fire district operating under KRS Chapter 75 for expenses related to each

18 hundred dollars ($300) for transporting a person and one hundred fifty dollars
19 ($150) for arriving at person's location when no person is transported.
20 (b) The payment established in paragraph (a) of this subsection shall be in
21 addition to any insurance moneys the fire district may be eligible to receive
22 resulting from the response.
