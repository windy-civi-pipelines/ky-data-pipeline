17 is increased in excess of the minimum hourly wage in effect under this
18 subsection, the minimum hourly wage under this subsection shall be increased
19 to the same amount, effective on the same date as the federal minimum hourly
20 wage rate. If the state minimum hourly wage is increased to the federal
21 minimum hourly wage, it shall include only the federal minimum hourly rate
22 prescribed in 29 U.S.C. sec. 206(a)(1) and shall not include other wage rates
23 or conditions, exclusions, or exceptions to the federal minimum hourly wage
24 rate. In addition, the increase to the federal minimum hourly wage rate does
25 not extend or modify the scope or coverage of the minimum wage rate
26 required under this chapter.

1 employee engaged in an occupation in which he or she customarily and
2 regularly receives more than thirty dollars ($30) per month in tips from
3 patrons or others, the employer may pay as a minimum not less than:
4 1. Eight dollars ($8) an hour beginning on the effective date of this Act;
5 2. Ten dollars ($10) an hour beginning on July 1, 2026;
6 3. Twelve dollars ($12) an hour beginning on July 1, 2027;
7 4. Thirteen dollars and fifty cents ($13.50) an hour beginning on July 1,

9 5. Fifteen dollars ($15) an hour beginning on July 1, 2029; and
10 6. Seventeen dollars ($17) an hour beginning on July 1, 2030.
11 (b) If[the hourly wage rate required to be paid a tipped employee under] the
12 federal minimum hourly wage [law ]as prescribed by 29 U.S.C. sec. 203 is
13 increased in excess of the minimum hourly wage in effect under this
14 subsection, the minimum hourly wage under this subsection shall be
15 increased to the same amount, effective on the same date as the federal
16 minimum hourly wage rate.
17 (c) The employer shall establish by his or her records that for each week where
18 credit is taken, when adding tips received to wages paid, not less than the

20 was received by the employee. No employer shall use all or part of any tips or
21 gratuities received by employees toward the payment of the statutory
22 minimum hourly wage as required by subsection (1) of this section[29 U.S.C.
23 sec. 203]. Nothing, however, shall prevent employees from entering into an
24 agreement to divide tips or gratuities among themselves.
25 (3) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict the power of any city,
26 county, urban-county government, charter county government, consolidated local
27 government, or unified local government to adopt and enforce minimum wage
