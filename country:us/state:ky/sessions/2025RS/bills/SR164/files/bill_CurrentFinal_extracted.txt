2 animals in wasteful government experiments.
3 WHEREAS, animals routinely suffer for humans to assess the toxicity of products,
4 including cosmetics, household cleaners, drugs, vaccines, pesticides, and industrial
5 chemicals, and are frequently killed at the conclusion of these experiments; and
6 WHEREAS, animal tests are no longer the best predictors of human safety, with
7 approximately 90 percent of potential drugs failing during human trials due to unexpected
8 toxicity or lack of efficacy, while alternative methods, based on human biology, can
9 provide more predictive results and save time and money; and
10 WHEREAS, according to United States Department of Agriculture records, at least
11 1,880 animals were held or used for research and testing by Kentucky’s colleges and
12 universities in 2023, including 239 dogs and 112 cats; and
13 WHEREAS, the National Institutes of Health spent up to $56 million in taxpayer
14 dollars on 120 projects that used animals for experiments in Kentucky in 2024, with the
15 vast majority of that funding going to colleges and universities; and
16 WHEREAS, reforms to wasteful and unnecessary government spending on animal
17 testing have received renewed attention through the recent passage of the FDA
18 Modernization Act 2.0, sponsored by United States Senator Rand Paul, to remove animal
19 testing requirements for the Food and Drug Administration's approval and a commitment
20 by the Environmental Protection Agency to phase out mammal testing by 2035; and
21 WHEREAS, legislation may be considered during the 2026 Regular Session of the
22 Kentucky General Assembly to further explore this issue and consider possible remedies
23 to promote animal welfare and reduce government waste;
24 NOW, THEREFORE,
25 Be it resolved by the Senate of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of
26 Kentucky:

8 and testing by the institution in 2024;

10 the stated purpose of each project, and the species and number of animals used by each
11 project;
12 (3) The total amount of funding spent on the projects identified in subsection (2)
13 of this section, including federal, state, private, and other funding;
14 (4) A description of any programs used to place adoptable animals following the
15 end of their use in research, including the total number of animals, by species, released
16 for adoption in 2024; and
17 (5) A detailed explanation of specific efforts by the institution to refine, reduce,
18 and replace the use of animals in research and testing during the preceding calendar year.
19 Section 3. The Clerk of the Senate is directed to transmit a copy of this
20 Resolution to the presidents of Morehead State University, Murray State University, the
21 Owensboro Community and Technical College, the University of Kentucky, the
