2 ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY
(2) If upon receipt of notification, reasonable grounds evidence any[are believed to exist for such] violation or
danger in the workplace, then a special inspection shall be made in accordance with the provisions of KRS
338.101 and 338.111. If no reasonable grounds evidence a potential[are believed to exist for such] violation
or[of] danger, then the commissioner shall notify the employee or the representative authorized by[of] the
employees in writing of such determination.
(3) (a) No person shall discharge or in any manner discriminate against any employee because such employee
has filed any complaint or instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding under or related to this
chapter or has testified or is about to testify in any such proceeding or because of the exercise by such
employee on behalf of himself or herself or others of any right afforded by this chapter; and
(b) Any employee who believes that he or she has been discharged or otherwise discriminated against by
any person in violation of this subsection may, within thirty (30) days[a reasonable time] after such
violation occurs, file a complaint with the commissioner alleging such discrimination. Upon receipt of
such complaint, the commissioner shall cause such investigation to be made as deemed appropriate. If
upon such investigation, the commissioner determines that the provisions of this subsection have been
violated, he or she shall issue a citation to the employer within six (6) months of the occurrence of the
violation, which may be challenged or contested in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and
the review commission may order [all appropriate relief including ]the rehiring and reinstatement of the
employee to his or her former position with back pay.[ Upon an initial determination by the
commissioner that an employee has been discharged by an employer in violation of subsection (3)(a) of
this section, the secretary of the Education and Labor Cabinet may order reinstatement of the employee
pending a final determination and order of the review commission.]
Section 5. KRS 338.141 is amended to read as follows:
(1) If upon inspection an authorized representative of the commissioner finds that an employer has violated any
requirement of this chapter, a citation shall be issued to the employer. Each citation shall describe with
particularity the alleged violation, including a reference to the provision of the act, standard, rule, or
administrative regulation alleged to have been violated. Each citation shall[,] establish the time period
permitted for correction of the alleged violation by fixing a reasonable date for elimination of[by which] the
alleged violation [shall be eliminated, ]and may propose a[the] civil penalty to be paid. If within fifteen (15)
working days from the receipt of the citation an employer, employee, or the employees' representative [of the
employees ]fails to notify the commissioner that he or she intends to contest the citation, then the citation shall
be deemed a final order of the review commission and not be subject to review by any court or agency.
(2) Any citation or a notice of a de minimis violation shall be promptly issued after the inspection. A citation or
a notice of a de minimis violation shall not be issued more than six (6) months after the occurrence of any
alleged violation. As used in this subsection, a de minimis violation is a violation that has no direct or
immediate relationship to safety or health. A citation that is issued under this section shall not be classified
as a repeated violation when issued more than three (3) consecutive years from the final order date of the
previous citation.
(3)[(2)] The commissioner, upon determination that an employer is acting in good faith to correct the cited
violation, may grant additional time for correction[compliance] upon application by the employer.
(4)[(3)] If an employer, employee, or the employees' representative [of the employees ]notifies the
commissioner that he or she intends to challenge a citation issued under this section or under KRS 338.131, the
commissioner shall notify the review commission of such notification and the review commission shall afford
an opportunity for a hearing.
(5)[(4)] In the case of any review proceedings initiated by an employer, employee, or the employees'
representative [of the employees ]under this chapter, the time period permitted for correction of cited
violations shall be tolled until the conclusion of the action[may be extended by the review commission].
Section 6. KRS 338.991 is amended to read as follows:
(1) Any employer who willfully or repeatedly violates the requirement of any section of this chapter, including
any standard, regulation, or order promulgated pursuant to this chapter, may be assessed a civil penalty of up
to seventy thousand dollars ($70,000) for each violation, but not less than five thousand dollars ($5,000) for
each willful violation.

CHAPTER 105 3
(2) Any employer who has received a citation for a serious violation of the requirements of any section of this
chapter, including any standard, regulation, or order promulgated pursuant to this chapter, shall be assessed a
civil penalty of up to seven thousand dollars ($7,000) for each violation.
(3) Any employer who has received a citation for a violation of the requirements of any section of this chapter,
including any standard, regulation, or order promulgated pursuant to this chapter, and such violation is
specifically determined not to be of a serious nature, may be assessed a civil penalty of up to seven thousand
dollars ($7,000) for each violation.
(4) Any employer who receives a notice of a de minimis violation of any section of this chapter, including any
standard, administrative regulation, or order promulgated pursuant to this chapter, shall not be assessed a
civil penalty. As used in this subsection, a de minimis violation is a violation that has no direct or immediate
relationship to safety or health.

for its correction may be assessed a civil penalty of up to seven thousand dollars ($7,000) for each day during

penalty of up to ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for each violation.
(7)[(6)] The review commission shall have the authority to modify all civil penalties and fines provided for in
this chapter. The review commission may, at its discretion, suspend the time period allotted for correction of a
violation during the review of an appeal from the violation in question.
(8)[(7)] All civil penalties and fines collected under the provision of this chapter shall be paid into the general
fund.
(9)[(8)] Any employer or individual who knowingly makes any false statement, representation, or certification
in any application, record, report, plan, or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this
chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000), or by
imprisonment for not more than six (6) months, or by both.
(10)[(9)] Any person who gives advance notice of any investigation or inspection to be conducted under this
chapter, without authority from the commissioner, shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more
than one thousand dollars ($1,000), or by imprisonment for not more than six (6) months, or by both.
(11)[(10)] Any employer or individual who willfully causes bodily harm to any authorized representative of the
commissioner while attempting to conduct an investigation or inspection under the provisions of this chapter,
shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000), or by
imprisonment for not more than one (1) year, or by both.
(12)[(11)] As used in this section, a serious violation shall be deemed to exist in a place of employment if there is
a substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a condition which exists, or from
one (1) or more practices, means, methods, operations, or processes which have been adopted or are in use, in
such place of employment unless the employer did not, and could not with the exercise of reasonable
diligence, know of the presence of the violation.
