23 in its common school system not less than ten (10) days of sick leave during each
24 school year, without deduction of salary. Sick leave shall be granted to a teacher or

27 cease to make payments under this paragraph;

11 entitled to a minimum monthly allowance of five hundred dollars ($500) as their
12 basic straight life annuity and their surviving spouse shall be eligible for survivor
13 benefits as provided in KRS 161.520(1)(a) and (b).
14 (8) Any member retired by reason of disability may voluntarily waive disability
15 benefits and [return to teaching or ]any member, who is immediately eligible for
16 service retirement[age sixty (60) years or older], may elect to waive disability
17 benefits and retire for service on the basis of service credited to the member on the
18 effective date of the disability retirement.
19 (9) In order to qualify for retirement by reason of disability a member must suffer from
20 a physical or mental condition presumed to be permanent in duration and of a
21 nature as to render the member incapable of being gainfully employed in a covered
22 position. The incapability must be revealed by a competent examination by a
23 licensed physician or physicians and must be approved by a majority of a medical
24 review committee.
25 (10) A member retired by reason of disability shall be required to undergo periodic
26 examinations at the discretion of the board of trustees to determine whether the
27 disability allowance shall be continued. When examination and recommendation of

1 a medical review committee indicate the disability no longer exists, the allowance
2 shall be discontinued. Failure to undergo examinations and provide the Teachers'
3 Retirement System with requested medical documentation shall result in a
4 suspension of disability benefits.
5 (11) Eligibility for payment shall begin on the first day of the month following receipt of
6 the application in the Teachers' Retirement System office, or the first of the month
7 next following the last payment of salary or sick leave benefits by the employer,
8 whichever is the later date.
9 (12) No person who receives a disability allowance may be employed in a position that
10 entails duties or qualification requirements similar to positions subject to
11 participation in the retirement system either within or without the State of
12 Kentucky. So doing shall constitute a misdemeanor and shall result in loss of the
13 allowance from the first date of this service. For purposes of this subsection and
14 subsection (13) of this section, "employment" and "occupation," and derivatives
15 thereof, mean any activity engaged in by the member receiving disability allowance
16 from which income is earned. A member who applies for and is approved for
17 disability retirement on or after July 1, 2002, and whose annual disability benefit is
18 less than forty thousand dollars ($40,000) may earn income in any occupation other
19 than covered employment only to the extent that the annual income from the other
20 employment when added to the annual disability benefit does not exceed forty
21 thousand dollars ($40,000). For any member who exceeds this limit as a result of
22 income from other employment, the Kentucky Teachers' Retirement System shall
23 reduce the member's disability benefit on a dollar-for-dollar basis for each dollar
24 that the member's combined annual disability benefit and annual income from other
25 employment exceeds forty thousand dollars ($40,000). The board of trustees may
26 annually increase the forty thousand dollar ($40,000) limit by the percentage
27 increase in the annual average of the consumer price index for all urban consumers

1 for the most recent calendar year as published by the Federal Bureau of Labor
2 Statistics, not to exceed five percent (5%). The retirement system may require
3 income and employment verification from the member, including but not limited to
4 copies of tax returns and federal forms W-2 and W-4P. Failure to provide the
5 Teachers' Retirement System with requested income and employment verification
6 documentation shall result in a suspension of disability benefits. Submission of
7 false or fraudulent documentation shall, in addition to criminal penalties, result
8 in disqualification of all disability benefits from the date the fraudulent
9 documentation was submitted.
10 (13) All members who applied for disability retirement before July 1, 2002, and were
11 approved as a result of that application shall be subject to the income limitations as
12 they existed on June 30, 2002, until July 1, 2006. Effective July 1, 2006, the
13 twenty-seven thousand dollar ($27,000) limitation shall be increased to forty
14 thousand dollars ($40,000) and may be adjusted by the board of trustees by the
15 consumer price index in the manner described in subsection (12) of this section.
16 The recipient of a disability allowance who engages in any gainful occupation other
17 than covered employment must make a report of the duties involved, compensation
18 received, and any other pertinent information required by the board of trustees. The
19 retirement system may require income and employment verification from the
20 member, including but not limited to copies of tax returns and federal forms W-2
21 and W-4P. Failure to provide the Teachers' Retirement System with requested
22 income and employment verification documentation shall result in a suspension
23 of disability benefits. Submission of false or fraudulent documentation shall, in
24 addition to criminal penalties, result in disqualification of all disability benefits
25 from the date the fraudulent documentation was submitted.
26 (14) The board of trustees shall designate medical review committees, each consisting of
27 three (3) licensed physicians. A medical review committee shall pass upon all
Page 59 of 72

1 applications for disability retirement and upon all applicant statements, medical
2 certifications, and examinations submitted in connection with disability
3 applications. The disposition of each case shall be recommended by a medical
4 review committee in writing to the retirement system. Members of a medical review
5 committee shall follow administrative regulations regarding procedures as the board
6 of trustees may enact and shall be paid reasonable fees and expenses as authorized
7 by the board of trustees in compliance with the provisions of KRS 161.330 and
8 161.340. The retirement system may secure additional medical examinations and
9 information as it deems necessary. A member may appeal any final agency decision
10 denying his or her disability retirement application pursuant to the provisions of
11 KRS 161.250(2). In the event of such an appeal, the member and his or her legal
12 counsel shall be entitled to all written recommendations and reports submitted by
13 the medical review committee to the Teachers' Retirement System. Such
14 recommendations and reports shall otherwise be maintained in a confidential
15 manner and shall not be subject to release under any conditions, including in
16 response to a subpoena or order issued by a court of law notwithstanding any
17 other statute to the contrary.
18 (15) A disability may be presumed to be permanent if the condition creating the
19 disability may be reasonably expected to continue for one (1) year or more from the
20 date of application for disability benefits.
21 (16) Any member who has voluntarily waived disability benefits or whose disability
22 benefits have been discontinued on recommendation of a medical review
23 committee, may apply for reinstatement of disability benefits. The application for
24 reinstatement must be made to the retirement system within twelve (12) months of
25 the date disability benefits terminated. If the termination of benefits were voluntary,
26 the reinstatement may be made without medical examination if application is made
27 within three (3) months of the termination date. Other applications for reinstatement

1 will be processed in the same manner as new applications for benefits.
2 (17) No person who is receiving disability benefits under this section may be employed
3 in a position which qualifies the person for membership in a retirement system
4 financed wholly or in part with public funds. Employment in a position prohibited
5 by this subsection shall result in disqualification for those disability benefits from
6 the date of employment in the prohibited position.
7 (18) Any person who is receiving benefits and becomes disqualified from receiving
8 those benefits under this section, or becomes disqualified from receiving a portion
9 of those benefits due to income from other than covered employment, shall
10 immediately notify the Teachers' Retirement System of this disqualification in
11 writing and shall return all benefits paid after the date of disqualification. Failure to
12 comply with these provisions shall create an indebtedness of that person to the
13 Teachers' Retirement System. Interest at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum,
14 beginning on the date the written notice of disqualification is sent, shall be
15 charged if the debt is not repaid within sixty (60) days after the date of written
16 notice of disqualification. Failure to repay this debt creates a lien in favor of the
17 Teachers' Retirement System upon all property of the person who improperly
18 receives benefits and does not repay those benefits. The Teachers' Retirement
19 System may, in order to collect an outstanding debt, reduce or terminate any benefit
20 that a member is otherwise entitled to receive.
21 (19) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section to the contrary, individuals who
22 become members on or after January 1, 2022, shall be eligible for an actuarially
23 determined disability benefit as prescribed by the board of trustees via
24 administrative regulations promulgated by the board. The board of trustees shall
25 arrange by appropriate contract or on a self-insured basis a disability plan to
26 provide the disability benefits and may adjust the benefits in accordance with KRS
27 161.633(3) or 161.634(3).

1 AN ACT relating to teacher benefit provisions and declaring an emergency.
2 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
3 Section 1. KRS 161.155 is amended to read as follows:
4 (1) As used in this section:
5 (a) "Teacher" shall mean any person for whom certification is required as a basis
6 of employment in the common schools of the state;
7 (b) "Employee" shall mean any person, other than a teacher, employed in the
8 public schools, whether on a full or part-time basis;
9 (c) "Immediate family" shall mean the teacher's or employee's spouse, children
10 including stepchildren and foster children, grandchildren, daughters-in-law
11 and sons-in law, brothers and sisters, parents and spouse's parents, and
12 grandparents and spouse's grandparents, without reference to the location or
13 residence of said relative, and any other blood relative who resides in the
14 teacher's or employee's home;
15 (d) "Sick leave bank" shall mean an aggregation of sick leave days contributed by
16 teachers or employees for use by teachers or employees who have exhausted
17 all sick leave and other available paid leave days; and
18 (e) "Assault" shall mean an act that intentionally causes injury so significant that
19 the victim is determined to be, by certification of a physician or surgeon duly
20 qualified under KRS Chapter 342, incapable of performing the duties of his or
21 her job.
22 (2) Each district board of education shall allow to each teacher and full-time employee
23 in its common school system not less than ten (10) days of sick leave during each
24 school year, without deduction of salary. Sick leave shall be granted to a teacher or
25 employee if he or she presents a personal statement or a certificate of a physician
26 stating that the teacher or employee was ill, that the teacher or employee was absent
27 for the purpose of attending to a member of his or her immediate family who was

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS SB 9/EN
1 ill, or for the purpose of mourning a member of his or her immediate family. The
2 ten (10) days of sick leave granted in this subsection may be taken by a teacher or
3 employee on any ten (10) days of the school year and shall be granted in addition to
4 accumulated sick leave days that have been credited to the teacher or employee
5 under the provisions of subsection (4) of this section.
6 (3) A school district shall coordinate among the income and benefits from workers'
7 compensation, temporary disability retirement, and district payroll and benefits so
8 that there is no loss of income or benefits to a teacher or employee for work time
9 lost because of an assault while performing the teacher's or employee's assigned
10 duties for a period of up to one (1) year after the assault. In the event a teacher or
11 employee suffers an assault while performing his or her assigned duties that results
12 in injuries that qualify the teacher or employee for workers' compensation benefits,
13 the district shall provide leave to the teacher or employee for up to one (1) year
14 after the assault with no loss of income or benefits under the following conditions:
15 (a) The district shall pay the salary of the teacher or employee between the time
16 of the assault and the time the teacher's or employee's workers' compensation
17 income benefits take effect, or the time the teacher or employee is certified to
18 return to work by a physician or surgeon duly qualified under KRS Chapter
19 342, whichever is sooner;
20 (b) The district shall pay, for up to one (1) year from the time of the assault, the
21 difference between the salary of the teacher or employee and any workers'
22 compensation income benefits received by the teacher or employee resulting
23 from the assault. Payments by the district shall include payments for
24 intermittent work time missed as a result of the assault during the one (1) year
25 period. If the teacher's or employee's workers' compensation income benefits
26 cease during the one (1) year period after the assault, the district shall also
27 cease to make payments under this paragraph;

1 (c) The Commonwealth, through the Kentucky Department of Education, shall
2 make the employer's health insurance contribution during the period that the
3 district makes payments under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection;
4 (d) The Commonwealth, through the Kentucky Department of Education, shall
5 make the employer's contribution to the retirement system in which the
6 teacher or employee is a member during the period that the district makes
7 payments under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection; and
8 (e) Payments to a teacher or employee under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this
9 subsection shall be coordinated with workers' compensation benefits under
10 KRS Chapter 342, disability retirement benefits for teachers under KRS
11 161.661 to 161.663, and disability retirement benefits for employees under
12 KRS 61.600 to 61.621 and 78.5522, 78.5524, 78.5526, 78.5528, and 78.5530
13 so that the teacher or employee receives income equivalent to his or her full
14 contracted salary, but in no event shall the combined payments exceed one
15 hundred percent (100%) of the teacher's or employee's full contracted salary.
16 (4) Days of sick leave not taken by an employee or a teacher during any school year
17 shall accumulate without limitation and be credited to that employee or teacher.
18 Accumulated sick leave may be taken in any school year. Any district board of

21 may allow school district employees and teachers to use up to three (3) days' sick
22 leave per school year for emergency leave pursuant to KRS 161.152(3). Any
23 accumulated sick leave days credited to an employee or a teacher shall remain so

5 determines to be reasonable.
6 (6) Any school teacher or employee may repurchase previously used sick leave days
7 with the concurrence of the local school board by paying to the district an amount
8 equal to the total of all costs associated with the used sick leave.
9 (7) A district board of education may adopt a plan for a sick leave bank. The plan may
10 include limitations upon the number of days a teacher or employee may annually
11 contribute to the bank and limitations upon the number of days a teacher or
12 employee may annually draw from the bank. Only those teachers or employees who
13 contribute to the bank may draw upon the bank. Days contributed will be deducted
14 from the days available to the contributing teacher or employee. The sick leave
15 bank shall be administered in accordance with a policy adopted by the board of
16 education.
17 (8) (a) A district board of education shall establish a sick leave donation program to
18 permit teachers or employees to voluntarily contribute sick leave to teachers

21 fifteen (15) days' sick leave may request the board of education to transfer a
22 designated amount of sick leave to another teacher or employee who is
23 authorized to receive the sick leave donated. A teacher or employee may not
24 request an amount of sick leave be donated that reduces his or her sick leave
25 balance to less than fifteen (15) days.
26 (b) A teacher or employee may receive donations of sick leave if:
27 1. a. The teacher or employee or a member of his or her immediate

4 (10) days; or
5 b. The teacher or employee suffers from a catastrophic loss to his or
6 her personal or real property, due to either a natural disaster or fire,
7 that either has caused or will likely cause the employee to be
8 absent for at least ten (10) consecutive working days;
9 2. The teacher's or employee's need for the absence and use of leave are
10 certified by a licensed physician for leave requested under subparagraph
11 1.a. of this subsection;

13 leave, personal leave, and any other leave granted by the school district;
14 and

1 (b) On or before July 1, 2030, each school district shall establish a policy to
2 provide up to thirty (30) paid maternity leave days for a teacher or employee

4 of this section, or when the member's eligibility for disability benefits is terminated
5 upon recommendation of a medical review committee, and this service shall be
6 used in calculating benefits as provided in subsection (5) of this section, but under

2 life annuity. The minimum allowance shall be effective July 1, 1992, and shall
3 apply to those members who have had their allowance recalculated prior to that date
4 and to disability retirees who will have their benefit allowance recalculated on or
5 after that date. For individuals who become members on or after July 1, 2021,

19 (9) In order to qualify for retirement by reason of disability a member must suffer from
20 a physical or mental condition presumed to be permanent in duration and of a
21 nature as to render the member incapable of being gainfully employed in a covered
22 position. The incapability must be revealed by a competent examination by a
23 licensed physician or physicians and must be approved by a majority of a medical
24 review committee.
25 (10) A member retired by reason of disability shall be required to undergo periodic

2 shall be discontinued. Failure to undergo examinations and provide the Teachers'
3 Retirement System with requested medical documentation shall result in a
4 suspension of disability benefits.
5 (11) Eligibility for payment shall begin on the first day of the month following receipt of
6 the application in the Teachers' Retirement System office, or the first of the month
7 next following the last payment of salary or sick leave benefits by the employer,

9 (12) No person who receives a disability allowance may be employed in a position that
10 entails duties or qualification requirements similar to positions subject to
11 participation in the retirement system either within or without the State of
12 Kentucky. So doing shall constitute a misdemeanor and shall result in loss of the
13 allowance from the first date of this service. For purposes of this subsection and
14 subsection (13) of this section, "employment" and "occupation," and derivatives
15 thereof, mean any activity engaged in by the member receiving disability allowance
16 from which income is earned. A member who applies for and is approved for
17 disability retirement on or after July 1, 2002, and whose annual disability benefit is
18 less than forty thousand dollars ($40,000) may earn income in any occupation other
19 than covered employment only to the extent that the annual income from the other
20 employment when added to the annual disability benefit does not exceed forty
21 thousand dollars ($40,000). For any member who exceeds this limit as a result of
22 income from other employment, the Kentucky Teachers' Retirement System shall
23 reduce the member's disability benefit on a dollar-for-dollar basis for each dollar
24 that the member's combined annual disability benefit and annual income from other
25 employment exceeds forty thousand dollars ($40,000). The board of trustees may
26 annually increase the forty thousand dollar ($40,000) limit by the percentage
27 increase in the annual average of the consumer price index for all urban consumers

5 Teachers' Retirement System with requested income and employment verification
6 documentation shall result in a suspension of disability benefits. Submission of
7 false or fraudulent documentation shall, in addition to criminal penalties, result
8 in disqualification of all disability benefits from the date the fraudulent
9 documentation was submitted.
10 (13) All members who applied for disability retirement before July 1, 2002, and were
11 approved as a result of that application shall be subject to the income limitations as
12 they existed on June 30, 2002, until July 1, 2006. Effective July 1, 2006, the
13 twenty-seven thousand dollar ($27,000) limitation shall be increased to forty
14 thousand dollars ($40,000) and may be adjusted by the board of trustees by the
15 consumer price index in the manner described in subsection (12) of this section.
16 The recipient of a disability allowance who engages in any gainful occupation other
17 than covered employment must make a report of the duties involved, compensation
18 received, and any other pertinent information required by the board of trustees. The
19 retirement system may require income and employment verification from the
20 member, including but not limited to copies of tax returns and federal forms W-2
21 and W-4P. Failure to provide the Teachers' Retirement System with requested
22 income and employment verification documentation shall result in a suspension
23 of disability benefits. Submission of false or fraudulent documentation shall, in
24 addition to criminal penalties, result in disqualification of all disability benefits
25 from the date the fraudulent documentation was submitted.
26 (14) The board of trustees shall designate medical review committees, each consisting of
27 three (3) licensed physicians. A medical review committee shall pass upon all

1 applications for disability retirement and upon all applicant statements, medical
2 certifications, and examinations submitted in connection with disability
3 applications. The disposition of each case shall be recommended by a medical
4 review committee in writing to the retirement system. Members of a medical review
5 committee shall follow administrative regulations regarding procedures as the board
6 of trustees may enact and shall be paid reasonable fees and expenses as authorized
7 by the board of trustees in compliance with the provisions of KRS 161.330 and
8 161.340. The retirement system may secure additional medical examinations and
9 information as it deems necessary. A member may appeal any final agency decision
10 denying his or her disability retirement application pursuant to the provisions of
11 KRS 161.250(2). In the event of such an appeal, the member and his or her legal
12 counsel shall be entitled to all written recommendations and reports submitted by
13 the medical review committee to the Teachers' Retirement System. Such
14 recommendations and reports shall otherwise be maintained in a confidential
15 manner and shall not be subject to release under any conditions, including in
16 response to a subpoena or order issued by a court of law notwithstanding any
17 other statute to the contrary.
18 (15) A disability may be presumed to be permanent if the condition creating the
19 disability may be reasonably expected to continue for one (1) year or more from the
20 date of application for disability benefits.
21 (16) Any member who has voluntarily waived disability benefits or whose disability
22 benefits have been discontinued on recommendation of a medical review
23 committee, may apply for reinstatement of disability benefits. The application for
24 reinstatement must be made to the retirement system within twelve (12) months of
25 the date disability benefits terminated. If the termination of benefits were voluntary,
26 the reinstatement may be made without medical examination if application is made
27 within three (3) months of the termination date. Other applications for reinstatement

1 will be processed in the same manner as new applications for benefits.
2 (17) No person who is receiving disability benefits under this section may be employed
3 in a position which qualifies the person for membership in a retirement system
4 financed wholly or in part with public funds. Employment in a position prohibited
5 by this subsection shall result in disqualification for those disability benefits from
6 the date of employment in the prohibited position.
7 (18) Any person who is receiving benefits and becomes disqualified from receiving
8 those benefits under this section, or becomes disqualified from receiving a portion
9 of those benefits due to income from other than covered employment, shall
10 immediately notify the Teachers' Retirement System of this disqualification in
11 writing and shall return all benefits paid after the date of disqualification. Failure to
12 comply with these provisions shall create an indebtedness of that person to the
13 Teachers' Retirement System. Interest at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum,
14 beginning on the date the written notice of disqualification is sent, shall be
15 charged if the debt is not repaid within sixty (60) days after the date of written
16 notice of disqualification. Failure to repay this debt creates a lien in favor of the
17 Teachers' Retirement System upon all property of the person who improperly
18 receives benefits and does not repay those benefits. The Teachers' Retirement
19 System may, in order to collect an outstanding debt, reduce or terminate any benefit
20 that a member is otherwise entitled to receive.
21 (19) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section to the contrary, individuals who
22 become members on or after January 1, 2022, shall be eligible for an actuarially
23 determined disability benefit as prescribed by the board of trustees via
24 administrative regulations promulgated by the board. The board of trustees shall
25 arrange by appropriate contract or on a self-insured basis a disability plan to
26 provide the disability benefits and may adjust the benefits in accordance with KRS
27 161.633(3) or 161.634(3).
