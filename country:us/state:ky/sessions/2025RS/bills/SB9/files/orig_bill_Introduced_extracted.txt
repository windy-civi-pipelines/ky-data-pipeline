23 in its common school system not less than ten (10) days of sick leave during each
24 school year, without deduction of salary. Sick leave shall be granted to a teacher or

1 Teachers' Retirement System on or after January 1, 2022.
2 (7) The board of trustees shall have the authority to utilize or establish any plan or
3 plans authorized under the Internal Revenue Code to provide the benefits set forth
4 in this section.
5 Section 5. The Auditor or Public Accounts shall perform a special audit of
6 benefit programs provided by the Teachers' Retirement System which shall be paid by the
7 Teachers' Retirement System as part of its normal administrative expenses. The special
8 audit shall be limited to:
9 (1) An audit of the sick leave program established by Section 1 of this Act as it
10 relates to the Teachers' Retirement System and the sick leave reported by local school
11 districts to the Teachers' Retirement System as of June 30, 2025, to ensure that only the
12 sick leave that is eligible for payment under Section 1 of this Act and inclusion in a
13 retiring employee's final average salary as defined in KRS 161.220 is being reported
14 correctly according to Section 1 of this Act and that the cost of the sick leave program is
15 being reported correctly according to Section 2 of this Act; and
16 (2) An audit of the employers listed in subsection KRS 161.220(4) to determine if
17 any listed employers are providing coverage in the Teachers' Retirement System for other
18 entities on a contract basis, through a memorandum of agreement, or other method. The
19 audit shall provide a listing of each employer providing the retirement coverage, a listing
20 of entities for which retirement coverage is being provided through the employer and the
21 number of employees covered for each entity, and any estimated costs to the state for
22 providing the Teachers' Retirement System coverage to these entities.
23 Section 6. Whereas ensuring the accuracy of data and costs of the sick leave
24 programs provided by the Teachers' Retirement System will ensure the reliability of
25 future pension costs, an emergency is declared to exist, and this Act takes effect upon its
26 passage and approval by the Governor or upon its otherwise becoming a law.

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 382
1 AN ACT relating to teacher benefit provisions and declaring an emergency.
2 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
3 Section 1. KRS 161.155 is amended to read as follows:
4 (1) As used in this section:
5 (a) "Teacher" shall mean any person for whom certification is required as a basis
6 of employment in the common schools of the state;
7 (b) "Employee" shall mean any person, other than a teacher, employed in the
8 public schools, whether on a full or part-time basis;
9 (c) "Immediate family" shall mean the teacher's or employee's spouse, children
10 including stepchildren and foster children, grandchildren, daughters-in-law
11 and sons-in law, brothers and sisters, parents and spouse's parents, and
12 grandparents and spouse's grandparents, without reference to the location or
13 residence of said relative, and any other blood relative who resides in the
14 teacher's or employee's home;
15 (d) "Sick leave bank" shall mean an aggregation of sick leave days contributed by
16 teachers or employees for use by teachers or employees who have exhausted
17 all sick leave and other available paid leave days; and
18 (e) "Assault" shall mean an act that intentionally causes injury so significant that
19 the victim is determined to be, by certification of a physician or surgeon duly
20 qualified under KRS Chapter 342, incapable of performing the duties of his or
21 her job.
22 (2) Each district board of education shall allow to each teacher and full-time employee
23 in its common school system not less than ten (10) days of sick leave during each
24 school year, without deduction of salary. Sick leave shall be granted to a teacher or
25 employee if he or she presents a personal statement or a certificate of a physician
26 stating that the teacher or employee was ill, that the teacher or employee was absent
27 for the purpose of attending to a member of his or her immediate family who was
Page 1 of 15
BR038200.100 - 382 - XXXX 3/5/2025 4:46 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 382
1 ill, or for the purpose of mourning a member of his or her immediate family. The
2 ten (10) days of sick leave granted in this subsection may be taken by a teacher or
3 employee on any ten (10) days of the school year and shall be granted in addition to
4 accumulated sick leave days that have been credited to the teacher or employee
5 under the provisions of subsection (4) of this section.
6 (3) A school district shall coordinate among the income and benefits from workers'
7 compensation, temporary disability retirement, and district payroll and benefits so
8 that there is no loss of income or benefits to a teacher or employee for work time
9 lost because of an assault while performing the teacher's or employee's assigned
10 duties for a period of up to one (1) year after the assault. In the event a teacher or
11 employee suffers an assault while performing his or her assigned duties that results
12 in injuries that qualify the teacher or employee for workers' compensation benefits,
13 the district shall provide leave to the teacher or employee for up to one (1) year
14 after the assault with no loss of income or benefits under the following conditions:
15 (a) The district shall pay the salary of the teacher or employee between the time
16 of the assault and the time the teacher's or employee's workers' compensation
17 income benefits take effect, or the time the teacher or employee is certified to
18 return to work by a physician or surgeon duly qualified under KRS Chapter
19 342, whichever is sooner;
20 (b) The district shall pay, for up to one (1) year from the time of the assault, the
21 difference between the salary of the teacher or employee and any workers'
22 compensation income benefits received by the teacher or employee resulting
23 from the assault. Payments by the district shall include payments for
24 intermittent work time missed as a result of the assault during the one (1) year
25 period. If the teacher's or employee's workers' compensation income benefits
26 cease during the one (1) year period after the assault, the district shall also
27 cease to make payments under this paragraph;

BR038200.100 - 382 - XXXX 3/5/2025 4:46 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 382
1 (c) The Commonwealth, through the Kentucky Department of Education, shall
2 make the employer's health insurance contribution during the period that the
3 district makes payments under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection;
4 (d) The Commonwealth, through the Kentucky Department of Education, shall
5 make the employer's contribution to the retirement system in which the
6 teacher or employee is a member during the period that the district makes
7 payments under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection; and
8 (e) Payments to a teacher or employee under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this
9 subsection shall be coordinated with workers' compensation benefits under
10 KRS Chapter 342, disability retirement benefits for teachers under KRS
11 161.661 to 161.663, and disability retirement benefits for employees under
12 KRS 61.600 to 61.621 and 78.5522, 78.5524, 78.5526, 78.5528, and 78.5530
13 so that the teacher or employee receives income equivalent to his or her full
14 contracted salary, but in no event shall the combined payments exceed one
15 hundred percent (100%) of the teacher's or employee's full contracted salary.
16 (4) Days of sick leave not taken by an employee or a teacher during any school year
17 shall accumulate without limitation and be credited to that employee or teacher.
18 Accumulated sick leave may be taken in any school year. Any district board of
19 education may, in its discretion, allow employees or teachers in its common school
20 system sick leave in excess of the number of days prescribed in this section and
21 may allow school district employees and teachers to use up to three (3) days' sick
22 leave per school year for emergency leave pursuant to KRS 161.152(3). Any
23 accumulated sick leave days credited to an employee or a teacher shall remain so
24 credited in the event he or she transfers his or her place of employment from one (1)
25 school district to another within the state or to the Kentucky Department of
26 Education or transfers from the Department of Education to a school district.
27 (5) Accumulated days of sick leave shall be granted to a teacher or employee if, prior to

1 the opening day of the school year, a statement or a certificate of a physician is
2 presented to the district board of education, stating that the teacher or employee is
3 unable to commence his or her duties on the opening day of the school year, but
4 will be able to assume his or her duties within a period of time that the board
5 determines to be reasonable.
6 (6) Any school teacher or employee may repurchase previously used sick leave days
7 with the concurrence of the local school board by paying to the district an amount
8 equal to the total of all costs associated with the used sick leave.
9 (7) A district board of education may adopt a plan for a sick leave bank. The plan may
10 include limitations upon the number of days a teacher or employee may annually
11 contribute to the bank and limitations upon the number of days a teacher or
12 employee may annually draw from the bank. Only those teachers or employees who
13 contribute to the bank may draw upon the bank. Days contributed will be deducted
14 from the days available to the contributing teacher or employee. The sick leave
15 bank shall be administered in accordance with a policy adopted by the board of
16 education.
17 (8) (a) A district board of education shall establish a sick leave donation program to
18 permit teachers or employees to voluntarily contribute sick leave to teachers
19 or employees in the same school district who are in need of an extended
20 absence from school. A teacher or employee who has accrued more than
21 fifteen (15) days' sick leave may request the board of education to transfer a
22 designated amount of sick leave to another teacher or employee who is
23 authorized to receive the sick leave donated. A teacher or employee may not
24 request an amount of sick leave be donated that reduces his or her sick leave
25 balance to less than fifteen (15) days.
26 (b) A teacher or employee may receive donations of sick leave if:
27 1. a. The teacher or employee or a member of his or her immediate

2 impairment, or physical or mental condition that has caused or is
3 likely to cause the teacher or employee to be absent for at least ten
4 (10) days; or
5 b. The teacher or employee suffers from a catastrophic loss to his or
6 her personal or real property, due to either a natural disaster or fire,
7 that either has caused or will likely cause the employee to be
8 absent for at least ten (10) consecutive working days;
9 2. The teacher's or employee's need for the absence and use of leave are
10 certified by a licensed physician for leave requested under subparagraph
11 1.a. of this subsection;
12 3. The teacher or employee has exhausted his or her accumulated sick
13 leave, personal leave, and any other leave granted by the school district;
14 and
15 4. The teacher or employee has complied with the school district's policies
16 governing the use of sick leave.
17 (c) While a teacher or employee is on sick leave provided by this section, he or
18 she shall be considered a school district employee, and his or her salary,
19 wages, and other employee benefits shall not be affected.
20 (d) Any sick leave that remains unused, is not needed by a teacher or employee,
21 and will not be needed in the future shall be returned to the teacher or
22 employee donating the sick leave.
23 (e) The board of education shall adopt policies and procedures necessary to
24 implement the sick leave donation program.
25 (9) (a) A teacher or employee may use up to thirty (30) days of sick leave following

1 (b) On or before July 1, 2030, each school district shall establish a policy to
2 provide up to thirty (30) paid maternity leave days for a teacher or employee
3 who gives birth to a child. The maternity leave days shall be used without
4 deduction of salary and shall be used prior to the teacher or employee using
5 any other leave. Any maternity leave days unused by the teacher or
6 employee shall not transfer into sick leave or be converted to any other leave
7 type and shall expire upon return to work.
8 (10) (a) [After July 1, 1982, ]A district board of education may compensate, at the
9 time of retirement or upon the death of a member in active contributing status
10 at the time of death who was eligible to retire by reason of service, an
11 employee or a teacher, or the estate of an employee or teacher, for each

6 (f) For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025, and each fiscal year thereafter,
