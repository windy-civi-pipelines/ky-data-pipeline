(1) As used in this section:
(a) "Teacher" shall mean any person for whom certification is required as a basis of employment in the
common schools of the state;
(b) "Employee" shall mean any person, other than a teacher, employed in the public schools, whether on a
full or part-time basis;
(c) "Immediate family" shall mean the teacher's or employee's spouse, children including stepchildren and
foster children, grandchildren, daughters-in-law and sons-in law, brothers and sisters, parents and
spouse's parents, and grandparents and spouse's grandparents, without reference to the location or
residence of said relative, and any other blood relative who resides in the teacher's or employee's home;
(d) "Sick leave bank" shall mean an aggregation of sick leave days contributed by teachers or employees
for use by teachers or employees who have exhausted all sick leave and other available paid leave days;
and
(e) "Assault" shall mean an act that intentionally causes injury so significant that the victim is determined
to be, by certification of a physician or surgeon duly qualified under KRS Chapter 342, incapable of
performing the duties of his or her job.
(2) Each district board of education shall allow to each teacher and full-time employee in its common school
system not less than ten (10) days of sick leave during each school year, without deduction of salary. Sick
leave shall be granted to a teacher or employee if he or she presents a personal statement or a certificate of a
physician stating that the teacher or employee was ill, that the teacher or employee was absent for the purpose
of attending to a member of his or her immediate family who was ill, or for the purpose of mourning a member
of his or her immediate family. The ten (10) days of sick leave granted in this subsection may be taken by a
teacher or employee on any ten (10) days of the school year and shall be granted in addition to accumulated
sick leave days that have been credited to the teacher or employee under the provisions of subsection (4) of
this section.
(3) A school district shall coordinate among the income and benefits from workers' compensation, temporary
disability retirement, and district payroll and benefits so that there is no loss of income or benefits to a teacher
or employee for work time lost because of an assault while performing the teacher's or employee's assigned
duties for a period of up to one (1) year after the assault. In the event a teacher or employee suffers an assault
while performing his or her assigned duties that results in injuries that qualify the teacher or employee for
workers' compensation benefits, the district shall provide leave to the teacher or employee for up to one (1)
year after the assault with no loss of income or benefits under the following conditions:
(a) The district shall pay the salary of the teacher or employee between the time of the assault and the time
the teacher's or employee's workers' compensation income benefits take effect, or the time the teacher or
employee is certified to return to work by a physician or surgeon duly qualified under KRS Chapter
342, whichever is sooner;
(b) The district shall pay, for up to one (1) year from the time of the assault, the difference between the
salary of the teacher or employee and any workers' compensation income benefits received by the
teacher or employee resulting from the assault. Payments by the district shall include payments for
intermittent work time missed as a result of the assault during the one (1) year period. If the teacher's or
employee's workers' compensation income benefits cease during the one (1) year period after the
assault, the district shall also cease to make payments under this paragraph;
(c) The Commonwealth, through the Kentucky Department of Education, shall make the employer's health
insurance contribution during the period that the district makes payments under paragraphs (a) and (b)
of this subsection;

(d) The Commonwealth, through the Kentucky Department of Education, shall make the employer's
contribution to the retirement system in which the teacher or employee is a member during the period
that the district makes payments under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection; and
(e) Payments to a teacher or employee under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection shall be coordinated

61.621 and 78.5522, 78.5524, 78.5526, 78.5528, and 78.5530 so that the teacher or employee receives
income equivalent to his or her full contracted salary, but in no event shall the combined payments
exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the teacher's or employee's full contracted salary.
(4) Days of sick leave not taken by an employee or a teacher during any school year shall accumulate without
limitation and be credited to that employee or teacher. Accumulated sick leave may be taken in any school
year. Any district board of education may, in its discretion, allow employees or teachers in its common school
system sick leave in excess of the number of days prescribed in this section and may allow school district
employees and teachers to use up to three (3) days' sick leave per school year for emergency leave pursuant to
KRS 161.152(3). Any accumulated sick leave days credited to an employee or a teacher shall remain so
credited in the event he or she transfers his or her place of employment from one (1) school district to another
within the state or to the Kentucky Department of Education or transfers from the Department of Education to
a school district.
(5) Accumulated days of sick leave shall be granted to a teacher or employee if, prior to the opening day of the
school year, a statement or a certificate of a physician is presented to the district board of education, stating
that the teacher or employee is unable to commence his or her duties on the opening day of the school year, but
will be able to assume his or her duties within a period of time that the board determines to be reasonable.
(6) Any school teacher or employee may repurchase previously used sick leave days with the concurrence of the
local school board by paying to the district an amount equal to the total of all costs associated with the used
sick leave.
(7) A district board of education may adopt a plan for a sick leave bank. The plan may include limitations upon
the number of days a teacher or employee may annually contribute to the bank and limitations upon the
number of days a teacher or employee may annually draw from the bank. Only those teachers or employees
who contribute to the bank may draw upon the bank. Days contributed will be deducted from the days
available to the contributing teacher or employee. The sick leave bank shall be administered in accordance
with a policy adopted by the board of education.
(8) (a) A district board of education shall establish a sick leave donation program to permit teachers or
employees to voluntarily contribute sick leave to teachers or employees in the same school district who
are in need of an extended absence from school. A teacher or employee who has accrued more than
fifteen (15) days' sick leave may request the board of education to transfer a designated amount of sick
leave to another teacher or employee who is authorized to receive the sick leave donated. A teacher or
employee may not request an amount of sick leave be donated that reduces his or her sick leave balance
to less than fifteen (15) days.
(b) A teacher or employee may receive donations of sick leave if:
1. a. The teacher or employee or a member of his or her immediate family suffers from a
medically certified illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that has
caused or is likely to cause the teacher or employee to be absent for at least ten (10) days;
or
b. The teacher or employee suffers from a catastrophic loss to his or her personal or real

physician for leave requested under subparagraph 1.a. of this subsection;
3. The teacher or employee has exhausted his or her accumulated sick leave, personal leave, and
any other leave granted by the school district; and
4. The teacher or employee has complied with the school district's policies governing the use of
sick leave.

CHAPTER 138 3
(c) While a teacher or employee is on sick leave provided by this section, he or she shall be considered a
school district employee, and his or her salary, wages, and other employee benefits shall not be
affected.
(d) Any sick leave that remains unused, is not needed by a teacher or employee, and will not be needed in
the future shall be returned to the teacher or employee donating the sick leave.
(e) The board of education shall adopt policies and procedures necessary to implement the sick leave
donation program.
(9) (a) A teacher or employee may use up to thirty (30) days of sick leave following the birth or adoption of a
child or children. Additional days may be used when the need is verified by a physician's statement.
(b) On or before July 1, 2030, each school district shall establish a policy to provide up to thirty (30) paid
maternity leave days for a teacher or employee who gives birth to a child. The maternity leave days
shall be used without deduction of salary and shall be used prior to the teacher or employee using
any other leave. Any maternity leave days unused by the teacher or employee shall not transfer into
sick leave or be converted to any other leave type and shall expire upon return to work. This
paragraph shall not limit a school district's authority to establish additional paid maternity benefits
or to provide paid parental leave benefits.
(10) (a) [After July 1, 1982, ]A district board of education may compensate, at the time of retirement or upon
the death of a member in active contributing status at the time of death who was eligible to retire by
reason of service, an employee or a teacher, or the estate of an employee or teacher, for each unused

thirty percent (30%).
(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this subsection, payment for unused sick leave days under this
subsection shall be incorporated into the annual salary of the final year of service for inclusion in the
calculation of the employee's or teacher's retirement allowance only at the time of his or her initial
retirement, provided that the member makes the regular retirement contribution for members on the sick
leave payment. The accumulation of these days includes unused sick leave days held by the employee
or teacher at the time of implementation of the program.
(c) For a teacher or employee who becomes a nonuniversity member of the Teachers' Retirement System
on or after January 1, 2022, as provided by KRS 161.220, payment for unused sick leave days under
this subsection shall not be incorporated into the annual compensation used to calculate the teacher's or

shall not include any annual leave described by KRS 161.540(1)(f) or the cost of unused sick
days for employees retiring from agencies listed in KRS 161.220(4)(d) and (f).
3. The last employer who is compensating the unused sick day as provided in paragraph (a) of
this subsection shall pay the actuarial costs of compensation for unused sick leave days not
paid by the state under subparagraph 2. of this paragraph. Upon the teacher's or employee's
retirement, the Teachers' Retirement System shall bill the last employer for the cost of the

and

The reporting required by this paragraph shall include a description of whether the policies or
contracts governing sick leave policies apply to all employees, a class of employees, or a specific

Education to a school district, from a school district to the Department of Education, or from one (1) school
district to another school district after July 15, 1981, shall receive credit for any unused sick leave to which the

limitation shall also not apply to the payment to a member for accrued annual leave if the individual becomes a
member before July 1, 2008, or accrued sick leave which is authorized by statute and which shall, for
individuals subject to KRS 161.155(10) who became nonuniversity members of the system prior to January 1,

1996. Under no circumstances shall annual compensation include compensation that is earned by a member
while on assignment to an organization or agency that is not a public board, institution, or agency listed in
subsection (4) of this section. In the event that federal law requires that a member continue membership in the
retirement system even though the member is on assignment to an organization or agency that is not a public
board, institution, or agency listed in subsection (4) of this section, the member's annual compensation for
retirement purposes shall be deemed to be the annual compensation, as limited by subsection (9) of this
section, last earned by the member while still employed solely by and providing services directly to a public
board, institution, or agency listed in subsection (4) of this section. The board of trustees shall determine if any

state or federal court of competent jurisdiction, of a felony related to his or her employment as provided
in subparagraphs 1. and 2. of this paragraph.
1. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, a person whose membership begins on or

system requiring the employee to give testimony or produce records for any purpose, in the absence of a
court order requiring the testimony of or production of records by a specific employee, the system may
designate an employee to give testimony or produce records upon the matter referred to in the

discontinued. KRS 161.520 and 161.525 shall not apply to survivors of disability retirees whose retirement
allowances have been recalculated at the expiration of the entitlement period. Members who have their
disability retirement allowance recalculated at the expiration of their entitlement period shall be entitled to a
minimum monthly allowance of five hundred dollars ($500) as the basic straight life annuity. The minimum
allowance shall be effective July 1, 1992, and shall apply to those members who have had their allowance
recalculated prior to that date and to disability retirees who will have their benefit allowance recalculated on or
after that date. For individuals who become members on or after July 1, 2021, disability retirement payments
and any other recurring payments payable by any other state-administered retirement system shall be applied
to reduce, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, the minimum monthly disability retirement allowance payable under
this subsection.
(7) Effective July 1, 1992, members retired for disability prior to July 1, 1964, shall be entitled to a minimum
monthly allowance of five hundred dollars ($500) as their basic straight life annuity and their surviving spouse
shall be eligible for survivor benefits as provided in KRS 161.520(1)(a) and (b).
(8) Any member retired by reason of disability may voluntarily waive disability benefits and [return to teaching or
]any member, who is immediately eligible for service retirement[age sixty (60) years or older], may elect to
waive disability benefits and retire for service on the basis of service credited to the member on the effective
date of the disability retirement.
(9) In order to qualify for retirement by reason of disability a member must suffer from a physical or mental
condition presumed to be permanent in duration and of a nature as to render the member incapable of being
gainfully employed in a covered position. The incapability must be revealed by a competent examination by a
licensed physician or physicians and must be approved by a majority of a medical review committee.
(10) A member retired by reason of disability shall be required to undergo periodic examinations at the discretion
of the board of trustees to determine whether the disability allowance shall be continued. When examination
and recommendation of a medical review committee indicate the disability no longer exists, the allowance
shall be discontinued. Failure to undergo examinations and provide the Teachers' Retirement System with
requested medical documentation shall result in a suspension of disability benefits.

CHAPTER 138 25
(11) Eligibility for payment shall begin on the first day of the month following receipt of the application in the
Teachers' Retirement System office, or the first of the month next following the last payment of salary or sick
leave benefits by the employer, whichever is the later date.
(12) No person who receives a disability allowance may be employed in a position that entails duties or
qualification requirements similar to positions subject to participation in the retirement system either within or
without the State of Kentucky. So doing shall constitute a misdemeanor and shall result in loss of the
allowance from the first date of this service. For purposes of this subsection and subsection (13) of this section,
"employment" and "occupation," and derivatives thereof, mean any activity engaged in by the member
receiving disability allowance from which income is earned. A member who applies for and is approved for
disability retirement on or after July 1, 2002, and whose annual disability benefit is less than forty thousand
dollars ($40,000) may earn income in any occupation other than covered employment only to the extent that
the annual income from the other employment when added to the annual disability benefit does not exceed
forty thousand dollars ($40,000). For any member who exceeds this limit as a result of income from other
employment, the Kentucky Teachers' Retirement System shall reduce the member's disability benefit on a
dollar-for-dollar basis for each dollar that the member's combined annual disability benefit and annual income
from other employment exceeds forty thousand dollars ($40,000). The board of trustees may annually increase
the forty thousand dollar ($40,000) limit by the percentage increase in the annual average of the consumer
price index for all urban consumers for the most recent calendar year as published by the Federal Bureau of
Labor Statistics, not to exceed five percent (5%). The retirement system may require income and employment
verification from the member, including but not limited to copies of tax returns and federal forms W-2 and W-
4P. Failure to provide the Teachers' Retirement System with requested income and employment verification
documentation shall result in a suspension of disability benefits. Submission of false or fraudulent
documentation shall, in addition to criminal penalties, result in disqualification of all disability benefits
from the date the fraudulent documentation was submitted.
(13) All members who applied for disability retirement before July 1, 2002, and were approved as a result of that
application shall be subject to the income limitations as they existed on June 30, 2002, until July 1, 2006.
Effective July 1, 2006, the twenty-seven thousand dollar ($27,000) limitation shall be increased to forty
thousand dollars ($40,000) and may be adjusted by the board of trustees by the consumer price index in the
manner described in subsection (12) of this section. The recipient of a disability allowance who engages in any
gainful occupation other than covered employment must make a report of the duties involved, compensation
received, and any other pertinent information required by the board of trustees. The retirement system may
require income and employment verification from the member, including but not limited to copies of tax
returns and federal forms W-2 and W-4P. Failure to provide the Teachers' Retirement System with requested
income and employment verification documentation shall result in a suspension of disability benefits.
Submission of false or fraudulent documentation shall, in addition to criminal penalties, result in
disqualification of all disability benefits from the date the fraudulent documentation was submitted.
(14) The board of trustees shall designate medical review committees, each consisting of three (3) licensed
physicians. A medical review committee shall pass upon all applications for disability retirement and upon all
applicant statements, medical certifications, and examinations submitted in connection with disability
applications. The disposition of each case shall be recommended by a medical review committee in writing to
the retirement system. Members of a medical review committee shall follow administrative regulations
regarding procedures as the board of trustees may enact and shall be paid reasonable fees and expenses as
authorized by the board of trustees in compliance with the provisions of KRS 161.330 and 161.340. The
retirement system may secure additional medical examinations and information as it deems necessary. A
member may appeal any final agency decision denying his or her disability retirement application pursuant to
the provisions of KRS 161.250(2). In the event of such an appeal, the member and his or her legal counsel
shall be entitled to all written recommendations and reports submitted by the medical review committee to
the Teachers' Retirement System. Such recommendations and reports shall otherwise be maintained in a
confidential manner and shall not be subject to release under any conditions, including in response to a
subpoena or order issued by a court of law notwithstanding any other statute to the contrary.
(15) A disability may be presumed to be permanent if the condition creating the disability may be reasonably
expected to continue for one (1) year or more from the date of application for disability benefits.
(16) Any member who has voluntarily waived disability benefits or whose disability benefits have been
discontinued on recommendation of a medical review committee, may apply for reinstatement of disability
benefits. The application for reinstatement must be made to the retirement system within twelve (12) months
Legislative Research Commission PDF Version

26 ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY
of the date disability benefits terminated. If the termination of benefits were voluntary, the reinstatement may
be made without medical examination if application is made within three (3) months of the termination date.
Other applications for reinstatement will be processed in the same manner as new applications for benefits.
(17) No person who is receiving disability benefits under this section may be employed in a position which
qualifies the person for membership in a retirement system financed wholly or in part with public funds.
Employment in a position prohibited by this subsection shall result in disqualification for those disability
benefits from the date of employment in the prohibited position.
(18) Any person who is receiving benefits and becomes disqualified from receiving those benefits under this
section, or becomes disqualified from receiving a portion of those benefits due to income from other than
covered employment, shall immediately notify the Teachers' Retirement System of this disqualification in
writing and shall return all benefits paid after the date of disqualification. Failure to comply with these
provisions shall create an indebtedness of that person to the Teachers' Retirement System. Interest at the rate
of eight percent (8%) per annum, beginning on the date the written notice of disqualification is sent, shall be
charged if the debt is not repaid within sixty (60) days after the date of written notice of disqualification.
Failure to repay this debt creates a lien in favor of the Teachers' Retirement System upon all property of the
person who improperly receives benefits and does not repay those benefits. The Teachers' Retirement System
may, in order to collect an outstanding debt, reduce or terminate any benefit that a member is otherwise
entitled to receive.
(19) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section to the contrary, individuals who become members on or
after January 1, 2022, shall be eligible for an actuarially determined disability benefit as prescribed by the
board of trustees via administrative regulations promulgated by the board. The board of trustees shall arrange
by appropriate contract or on a self-insured basis a disability plan to provide the disability benefits and may
adjust the benefits in accordance with KRS 161.633(3) or 161.634(3).
ïƒ¢Section 16. KRS 161.680 is amended to read as follows:
(1) If any change or error in a record results in any individual receiving from the retirement system more or less
than the individual was entitled to receive as determined by the board of trustees or staff of the Teachers'
Retirement System, the board of trustees or staff shall, when the error is discovered, correct the error, and as
far as practicable adjust the payments so that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which the individual was
entitled shall be paid.
(2) The Teachers' Retirement System shall take all practicable and cost-effective steps to collect overpayments
from a member's or retiree's account. Methods of correction of overpayments from any member's or retiree's
account shall include but are not limited to reclamation of the overpayment from the member's or retiree's
account at the depository bank, the deduction of moneys from account refunds, deduction from the retirement
allowance or joint and survivor annuity payable from the account, and deduction of moneys from the life
insurance benefit. Collection of overpayments shall be initiated regardless of the designated beneficiary for
any amounts payable from the account.

insurance benefits. The contribution provided by this subparagraph shall not be used to fund the
supplemental benefit account as provided by KRS 161.635;

members it employs to pay the cost of health insurance coverage for retirees who are not eligible for Medicare
and who retire on or after July 1, 2010, less the amounts that are otherwise required to be paid by the retirees
under KRS 161.675. The board shall deposit funds in the medical insurance fund unless the board of trustees

shall, in an actuarially accountable manner, be either decreased, suspended, or eliminated. The decrease,
suspension, or elimination in contributions required under subsection (1)(c)2. of this section shall not exceed
two and twenty-five thousandths percent (2.025%) of annual compensation. The decrease, suspension, or
elimination in contributions required under subsection (1)(e)3. of this section shall not exceed one and twenty-
five hundredths percent (1.25%) of annual compensation.

30 ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY
(5) Each employer shall remit the required employer contributions to the retirement system under the terms and
conditions specified for member contributions under KRS 161.560. The state shall provide annual

an annual appropriation is less than the amount of these requirements, the state shall make up the deficit in the
next biennium budget appropriation to the retirement system. Employer contributions to the retirement system
are for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to members and annuitants and these contributions shall be
considered deferred compensation to the members. This subsection shall not apply to costs applicable to
individuals who become members on or after January 1, 2022.
ïƒ¢Section 20. The following KRS section is repealed:
161.553 Funding of past statutory benefit improvements -- Schedules for appropriations -- Cost-of-living
increases.
ïƒ¢Section 21. The Auditor of Public Accounts shall perform a special audit of benefit programs provided by
the Teachers' Retirement System which shall be paid by the Teachers' Retirement System as part of its normal
administrative expenses. The special audit shall be limited to:
(1) An audit of the sick leave program established by Section 1 of this Act as it relates to the Teachers'
Retirement System and the sick leave reported by local school districts to the Teachers' Retirement System as of June
30, 2025, to ensure that only the sick leave that is eligible for payment under Section 1 of this Act and inclusion in a
retiring employee's final average salary as defined in Section 2 of this Act is being reported correctly according to
Section 1 of this Act and that the cost of the sick leave program is being reported correctly according to Section 5 of
this Act;
(2) An audit of the employers listed in subsection (4) of Section 2 of this Act to determine if any listed
employers are providing coverage in the Teachers' Retirement System for other entities on a contract basis, through a
memorandum of agreement, or other method. The audit shall provide a listing of each employer providing the
retirement coverage, a listing of entities for which retirement coverage is being provided through the employer and
the number of employees covered for each entity, and any estimated costs to the state for providing the Teachers'
Retirement System coverage to these entities; and
(3) An audit of the Teachers' Retirement System's annual leave program established by KRS 161.540(1)(f)
to report the agencies that are including annual leave payments in a retiring employee's final average salary as defined
in Section 2 of this Act, to report the policies of each agency participating in the annual leave program and the
number of employees covered by the policy of each agency, to evaluate how annual leave is reported to the system
and whether changes should be made to annual leave reporting process to the system to ensure proper cost estimates,
and a review of the cost of the annual leave program that is required to be disclosed in the annual valuation as
required by Section 5 of this Act.
ïƒ¢Section 22. Whereas ensuring the accuracy of data and costs of the sick leave programs provided by the
Teachers' Retirement System will ensure the reliability of future pension costs, an emergency is declared to exist, and
this Act takes effect upon its passage and approval by the Governor or upon its otherwise becoming a law.
Signed by Governor March 31, 2025.
