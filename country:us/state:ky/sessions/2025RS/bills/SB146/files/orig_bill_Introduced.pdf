1 AN ACT proposing an amendment to Section 32 of the Constitution of Kentucky
2 relating to terms of members of the General Assembly.
3 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
4 Section 1. Are you in favor of limiting the number of terms that a member of
5 the General Assembly may serve, by limiting a Senator to four terms in the Kentucky
6 Senate, and limiting a Representative to eight terms in the Kentucky House of
7 Representatives, beginning with the regular election in 2028, by amending the
8 Constitution of Kentucky to read as stated below?
9 Section 2. It is proposed that Section 32 of the Constitution of Kentucky be
10 amended to read as follows:
11 (1) No person shall be a Representative who, at the time of his election, is not a
12 citizen of Kentucky, has not attained the age of twenty-four years, and who has not
13 resided in this State two years next preceding his election, and the last year thereof in the
14 county, town or city for which he may be chosen. No person shall be a Senator who, at
15 the time of his election, is not a citizen of Kentucky, has not attained the age of thirty
16 years, and has not resided in this State six years next preceding his election, and the last
17 year thereof in the district for which he may be chosen.
18 (2) No person shall be elected to more than eight terms of office as a member of
19 the House of Representatives, or to more than four terms of office as a member of the
20 Senate. In determining the eligibility of an individual to hold an office as provided in
21 this section, time served in an office in fulfillment of a partial term as a result of a
22 special election to fill a vacancy shall not be considered unless the partial term is two
23 full years or more. Any person who is elected to an office in a regularly scheduled
24 election and resigns prior to the completion of the term for which he or she was elected
25 shall be considered to have served the full term in that office.
26 Section 3. It is further proposed as a schedule of transitional provisions for the
27 purposes of this amendment:
