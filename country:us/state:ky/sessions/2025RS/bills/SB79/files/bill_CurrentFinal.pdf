20 Chapter 48 shall provide that a reduction of the annual increment granted under this
21 section shall be made only after other cost savings measures, as provided by KRS
22 18A.113 are taken. Any such reduction shall be uniform for all state employees and
23 shall comply with the provisions of this chapter and KRS Chapter 48.
24 Section 16. KRS 132.370 is amended to read as follows:

1 (2) Property valuation administrators shall be elected in the year in which county
2 elections are held and shall enter upon the discharge of the duties of their office on
3 the first Monday in December after their election and continue in office for a period
4 of four (4) years, and until the election and qualification of their successors.
5 Property valuation administrators shall possess the qualifications required by
6 Section 100 of the Constitution and by KRS 132.380 and shall be eligible for
7 reelection.
8 (3) The property valuation administrators and all deputies and assistants of their offices
9 who qualify as full-time employees shall be eligible for participation in the
10 provisions of KRS 18A.205, 18A.230 to 18A.355, and 61.510 to 61.705.
11 (4) A property valuation administrator may be removed from office by the Circuit
12 Court of his or her county, upon petition of any taxpayer, or by the commissioner of
13 revenue for willful disobedience of any just or legal order of the department, or for
14 misfeasance or malfeasance in office or willful neglect in the discharge of his or her
15 official duties, including but not limited to intentional underassessment or
16 overassessment of properties and chronic underassessment of properties. For
17 purposes of this section and KRS 133.250, "chronic underassessment" means a
18 widespread pattern and practice of assessing properties at levels substantially below
19 fair market value which persists for a period of two (2) or more years as disclosed
20 by randomly selected sample appraisals conducted under the provisions of KRS
21 133.250, special audits conducted pursuant to KRS 133.250, or other means.
22 (5) If the commissioner determines that a property valuation administrator should be
23 removed from office, the property valuation administrator shall be notified in
24 writing, and the notice of intent to remove shall state the specific reasons for
25 removal. The notice shall also advise the property valuation administrator of his or
26 her right to a preremoval conference and an administrative hearing.
27 (6) A property valuation administrator may request a preremoval conference to appear

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS SB 79/GA
1 with or without counsel before the commissioner or his or her designee to answer
2 the charges against him or her. The preremoval conference shall be requested in
3 writing within six (6) working days of the date on which the notice of intent to
4 remove is received, and a preremoval conference shall be scheduled within seven
5 (7) working days of the date on which the request is received. The commissioner or
6 his or her designee shall render a decision within five (5) working days of the
7 conclusion of the preremoval conference. Failure of a property valuation
8 administrator to request a preremoval hearing shall not waive his or her right to
9 contest his or her removal through an administrative hearing.
10 (7) If an action to remove a property valuation administrator is initiated by the
11 commissioner of revenue, the property valuation administrator shall have the right
12 to appeal and upon appeal an administrative hearing shall be conducted in
13 accordance with KRS Chapter 13B. Appeal of the final order of the commissioner
14 of revenue may be filed in a Circuit Court of an adjacent judicial circuit in
15 accordance with KRS Chapter 13B, notwithstanding the provisions of KRS Chapter
16 18A.
17 (8) If a property valuation administrator is removed from office as provided in
18 subsections (4) to (7) of this section, he or she shall be ineligible to serve in the
19 office at any future date and shall forfeit any and all certification from the
20 Department of Revenue pertaining to the office.
21 (9) Notwithstanding the provisions of KRS 18A.110(7)[(5)](c), the department shall
22 promulgate administrative regulations allowing property valuation administrators
23 and their deputies to receive lump-sum payments for accrued annual leave and
24 compensatory time when separated from employment because of termination by the
25 employer, resignation, retirement, or death.

2 School for the Deaf and the Kentucky School for the Blind. The salary schedule
3 shall be the same as salary schedules in effect in local school districts in counties
4 containing a city of the first class and shall conform to the requirements for a single
5 salary schedule as defined in KRS 157.320, except the salary schedule shall not
6 limit the number of years of experience for a certified employee who transfers to
7 the school.
8 (2) (a) Certified teachers in the Kentucky School for the Deaf and the Kentucky
9 School for the Blind shall have the same statutory employment status and

16 (4) A certified teacher employed at one (1) of the schools on July 12, 2006, whose job
17 description does not include outreach responsibilities shall not be involuntarily
18 assigned to work on a permanent basis outside the county in which the employing
19 school is located.
20 (5) Nothing in KRS 18A.115 or 163.032 shall result in a loss of any leave accrued by a
21 certified teacher employed prior to July 12, 2006, by one (1) of the schools.
22 Accrued leave may be taken in accordance with the policy of the school.
23 (6) The Kentucky Department of Education, with assistance from the Kentucky
24 Personnel Cabinet, shall adopt a salary schedule for administrators for the Kentucky
25 School for the Deaf and the Kentucky School for the Blind. In considering the rate
26 of pay and the requirements of KRS 18A.110(9)[(7)](b), the department and the
27 cabinet shall consider rates that are based upon the duties and responsibilities of the
