2 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
3 SECTION 1. A NEW SECTION OF KRS CHAPTER 532 IS CREATED TO
4 READ AS FOLLOWS:
5 (1) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, capital punishment by
6 means of the death penalty is abolished as of the effective date of this Act.
7 (2) The court having jurisdiction over a person sentenced to death before the
8 effective date of this Act and for whom the death sentence has not been executed
9 shall sentence that person to imprisonment for life without benefit of probation or
10 parole.
11 Section 2. KRS 422.285 is amended to read as follows:
12 (1) (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, a person who was
13 convicted of a capital offense, a Class A felony, a Class B felony, or any
14 offense designated a violent offense under KRS 439.3401 and who meets the
15 requirements of this section may at any time request the forensic
16 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing and analysis of any evidence that is in
17 the possession or control of the court or Commonwealth, that is related to the
18 investigation or prosecution that resulted in the judgment of conviction and
19 that may contain biological evidence.
20 (b) This subsection shall not apply to offenses under KRS Chapter 218A, unless
21 the offense was accompanied by another offense outside of that chapter for
22 which testing is authorized by paragraph (a) of this subsection.
23 (2) Upon receipt of a request under this section accompanied by a supporting affidavit
24 containing sufficient factual averments to support the request from a person who
25 meets the requirements of subsection (5)(f) of this section at the time the request is
26 made for an offense to which the DNA relates, the court shall:
27 (a) If the petitioner is not represented by counsel, appoint the Department of

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1043
1 Public Advocacy to represent the petitioner for purposes of the request,
2 pursuant to KRS 31.110(2)(c); or
3 (b) If the petitioner is represented by counsel or waives appointment of counsel in
4 writing or if the Department of Public Advocacy has previously withdrawn

7 reasonable costs of the testing being requested.
8 (3) Counsel representing the petitioner shall be provided a reasonable opportunity to
9 investigate the petitioner's request and shall be permitted to supplement the request.
10 Pursuant to KRS 31.110(2)(c), the petitioner shall have no further right to counsel
11 provided by the Department of Public Advocacy on the matter if counsel
12 determines that it is not a proceeding that a reasonable person with adequate means
13 would be willing to bring at his or her own expense. If the Department of Public
14 Advocacy moves to withdraw as counsel for petitioner and the court grants the
15 motion, the court shall proceed as directed under subsection (2)(b) of this section.
16 (4) Upon receipt of the deposit required under subsection (2)(b) of this section or a
17 motion from counsel provided by the Department of Public Advocacy to proceed,
18 the court shall provide notice to the prosecutor and an opportunity to respond to the
19 petitioner's request.
20 (5) After due consideration of the request and any supplements and responses thereto,
21 the court shall order DNA testing and analysis if the court finds that all of the

24 prosecuted or convicted if exculpatory results had been obtained through
25 DNA testing and analysis;
26 (b) The evidence is still in existence and is in a condition that allows DNA testing
27 and analysis to be conducted;

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1043
1 (c) The evidence was not previously subjected to DNA testing and analysis or
2 was not subjected to the testing and analysis that is now requested and may
3 resolve an issue not previously resolved by the previous testing and analysis;
4 (d) Except for a petitioner sentenced to death prior to the effective date of this
5 Act, the petitioner was convicted of the offense after a trial or after entering an
6 Alford plea;
7 (e) Except for a petitioner sentenced to death prior to the effective date of this
8 Act, the testing is not sought for touch DNA, meaning casual or limited
9 contact DNA; and
10 (f) The petitioner is still incarcerated or on probation, parole, or other form of
11 correctional supervision, monitoring, or registration for the offense to which
12 the DNA relates.
13 (6) After due consideration of the request and any supplements and responses thereto,
14 the court may order DNA testing and analysis if the court finds that all of the
15 following apply:
16 (a) A reasonable probability exists that either:
17 1. The petitioner's verdict or sentence would have been more favorable if
18 the results of DNA testing and analysis had been available at the trial
19 leading to the judgment of conviction; or
20 2. DNA testing and analysis will produce exculpatory evidence;
21 (b) The evidence is still in existence and is in a condition that allows DNA testing
22 and analysis to be conducted;
23 (c) The evidence was not previously subject to DNA testing and analysis or was
24 not subjected to the testing and analysis that is now requested and that may
25 resolve an issue not previously resolved by the previous testing and analysis;
26 (d) Except for a petitioner sentenced to death prior to the effective date of this
27 Act, the petitioner was convicted of the offense after a trial or after entering an
Page 3 of 22

3 Act, the testing is not sought for touch DNA, meaning casual or limited
4 contact DNA; and
5 (f) The petitioner is still incarcerated or on probation, parole, or other form of
6 correctional supervision, monitoring, or registration for the offense to which
7 the DNA relates.
8 (7) The provisions of KRS 17.176 to the contrary notwithstanding, the petitioner shall
9 pay the costs of all testing and analysis ordered under this section. If the court
10 determines that the petitioner is a needy person using the standards set out in KRS
11 31.120 and the Department of Public Advocacy so moves, the court shall treat the
12 costs of testing and analysis as a direct expense of the defense for the purposes of
13 authorizing payment under KRS 31.185.
14 (8) If the prosecutor or defense counsel has previously subjected evidence to DNA
15 testing and analysis, the court shall order the prosecutor or defense counsel to
16 provide all the parties and the court with access to the laboratory reports that were
17 prepared in connection with the testing and analysis, including underlying data and
18 laboratory notes. If the court orders DNA testing and analysis pursuant to this
19 section, the court shall order the production of any laboratory reports that are
20 prepared in connection with the testing and analysis and may order the production
21 of any underlying data and laboratory notes.
22 (9) If a petition is filed pursuant to this section, the court shall order the state to
23 preserve during the pendency of the proceeding all evidence in the state's
24 possession or control that could be subjected to DNA testing and analysis. The state
25 shall prepare an inventory of the evidence and shall submit a copy of the inventory
26 to the defense and the court. If the evidence is intentionally destroyed after the court
27 orders its preservation, the court may impose appropriate sanctions, including

1 criminal contempt.
2 (10) The court may make any other orders that the court deems appropriate, including
3 designating any of the following:
4 (a) The preservation of some of the sample for replicating the testing and
5 analysis; and
6 (b) Elimination samples from third parties.
7 (11) If the results of the DNA testing and analysis are not favorable to the petitioner, the
8 court shall dismiss the petition. The court may make further orders as it deems
9 appropriate, including any of the following:
10 (a) Notifying the Department of Corrections and the Parole Board;
11 (b) Requesting that the petitioner's sample be added to the Department of
12 Kentucky State Police database; and
13 (c) Providing notification to the victim or family of the victim.
14 (12) Notwithstanding any other provision of law that would bar a hearing as untimely, if
15 the results of the DNA testing and analysis are favorable to the petitioner, the court
16 shall order a hearing and make any further orders that are required pursuant to this
17 section or the Kentucky Rules of Criminal Procedure.

5 exceeding sixty (60) days. The defendant may be remanded for this purpose to any
6 available clinic or mental hospital or the court may appoint a qualified psychiatrist
7 to make the examination.
8 (4) If the defendant has been convicted of a sex crime, as defined in KRS 17.500, prior
9 to determining the sentence or prior to final sentencing for youthful offenders, the

16 the court in determining the appropriate sentence. A copy of the comprehensive sex
17 offender presentence evaluation shall be furnished to the court, the
18 Commonwealth's attorney, and to counsel for the defendant. If the defendant is

22 and treatment of the sex offender shall fall under the provisions of KRS 197.440
23 and shall not be made a part of the court record subject to review in appellate
24 proceedings. The defendant shall pay for any comprehensive sex offender
25 presentence evaluation or treatment required pursuant to this section up to the
26 defendant's ability to pay but no more than the actual cost of the comprehensive sex
27 offender presentence evaluation or treatment.

5 meet those needs.
6 (6) Before imposing sentence, the court shall advise the defendant or his or her counsel
7 of the factual contents and conclusions of any presentence investigation or
8 psychiatric examinations and afford a fair opportunity and a reasonable period of
9 time, if the defendant so requests, to controvert them. The court shall provide the

2 2. If the Department of Corrections directs the transfer of a state prisoner
3 pursuant to subparagraph 1. of this paragraph, the jailer has fourteen
4 (14) days to transfer the state prisoner. If the jailer refuses to release
5 custody of the state prisoner to the receiving jail within fourteen (14)
6 days, the department shall reduce the per diem for the jail for an amount

3 jails, direct the transfer in accordance with subparagraph 1. of this
4 paragraph.
5 (g) If a jail has vacant beds in an area of the jail usually reserved for state

8 incarcerated may request the commissioner of the Department of Corrections to
9 incarcerate the felon in a state corrections institution if the jailer has reasons to
10 believe that the felon is an escape risk, a danger to himself or herself or other
11 inmates, an extreme security risk, or needs protective custody beyond that which
12 can be provided in a jail. The commissioner of the Department of Corrections shall
13 evaluate the request and transfer the inmate if he or she deems it necessary. If the
14 commissioner refuses to accept the felon inmate, and the Circuit Judge of the

17 may order the felon transferred to the custody of the Department of Corrections.
18 (6)[(7)] (a) Class D felons and Class C felons serving their time in a jail shall be

26 (20%) of the prisoner's weekly net pay earned from the community work
27 program or work release participation. In addition, the inmate may be required
Page 13 of 22

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1043
1 to pay for any drug testing performed on the inmate as a requirement of the

13 plan, or conditional discharge as provided in this chapter.

15 probation, probation with an alternative sentencing plan, or conditional discharge.
16 Unless the defendant is a violent offender[felon] as defined in KRS 439.3401 or a
17 statute prohibits probation, shock probation, or conditional discharge, after due
18 consideration of the defendant's risk and needs assessment, nature and
19 circumstances of the crime, and the history, character, and condition of the
20 defendant, probation or conditional discharge shall be granted, unless the court is of
21 the opinion that imprisonment is necessary for protection of the public because:
22 (a) There is substantial risk that during a period of probation or conditional
23 discharge the defendant will commit another crime;
24 (b) The defendant is in need of correctional treatment that can be provided most
25 effectively by his or her commitment to a correctional institution; or
26 (c) A disposition under this chapter will unduly depreciate the seriousness of the

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1043
1 (3) In the event the court determines that probation is not appropriate after due
2 consideration of the defendant's risk and needs assessment, nature and
3 circumstances of the crime, and the history, character, and condition of the
4 defendant, probation with an alternative sentencing plan shall be granted unless the
5 court is of the opinion that imprisonment is necessary for the protection of the
6 public because:
7 (a) There is a likelihood that during a period of probation with an alternative
8 sentencing plan or conditional discharge the defendant will commit a Class D
9 or Class C felony or a substantial risk that the defendant will commit a Class
10 B or Class A felony;
11 (b) The defendant is in need of correctional treatment that can be provided most
12 effectively by commitment to a correctional institution; or
13 (c) A disposition under this chapter will unduly depreciate the seriousness of the
14 defendant's crime.
15 (4) The court shall not determine that there is a likelihood that the defendant will
16 commit a Class C or Class D felony based upon the defendant's risk and needs
17 assessment and the fact that:
18 (a) The defendant has never been convicted of, pled guilty to, or entered an
19 Alford plea to a felony offense;
20 (b) If convicted of, having pled guilty to, or entered an Alford plea to a felony
21 offense, the defendant successfully completed probation more than ten (10)
22 years immediately prior to the date of the commission of the felony for which
23 the defendant is now being sentenced and has had no intervening convictions,
24 pleas of guilty, or Alford pleas to any criminal offense during that period; or
25 (c) The defendant has been released from incarceration for the commission of a
26 felony offense more than ten (10) years immediately prior to the date of the
27 commission of the felony for which the defendant is now being sentenced and

1 has had no intervening convictions, pleas of guilty, or Alford pleas to any
2 criminal offense during that period.
3 (5) In making a determination under subsection (4) of this section, the court may
4 determine that the greater weight of the evidence indicates that there is a likelihood
5 that the defendant will commit a Class C or Class D felony.
6 (6) Upon initial sentencing of a defendant or upon modification or revocation of
7 probation, when the court deems it in the best interest of the public and the
8 defendant, the court may order probation with the defendant to serve one (1) of the
9 following alternative sentences:
10 (a) To a halfway house for no more than twelve (12) months;
11 (b) To home incarceration with or without work release for no more than twelve

14 release, community service and other programs as required by the court;
15 (d) To a residential treatment program for the abuse of alcohol or controlled
16 substances;
17 (e) To a reentry center for no more than twelve (12) months; or
18 (f) To any other specified counseling program, rehabilitation or treatment
19 program, or facility.
20 (7) If during the term of the alternative sentence the defendant fails to adhere to and
21 complete the conditions of the alternative sentence, the court may modify the terms
22 of the alternative sentence or may modify or revoke probation and alternative
23 sentence and commit the defendant to an institution.
24 (8) In addition to those conditions that the court may impose, the conditions of
25 alternative sentence shall include the following and, if the court determines that the
26 defendant cannot comply with them, then they shall not be made available:

6 (1) For children who are alleged to be youthful offenders by falling in the purview of
7 KRS 635.020(2) to (8), the court shall at arraignment ensure that the child's rights
8 as specified in KRS 610.060 have been explained and followed.
9 (2) (a) In the case of a child alleged to be a youthful offender by falling within the
10 purview of KRS 635.020(2) to (8), the District Court shall, upon motion by
11 the county attorney to proceed under this chapter, and after the county
12 attorney has consulted with the Commonwealth's attorney, conduct a
13 preliminary hearing to determine if the child should be transferred to Circuit
14 Court as a youthful offender. The preliminary hearing shall be conducted in
15 accordance with the Rules of Criminal Procedure.
16 (b) At the preliminary hearing, the court shall determine if there is probable cause
17 to believe that an offense was committed, that the child committed the
18 offense, and that the child is of sufficient age and has the requisite number of
19 prior adjudications, if any, necessary to fall within the purview of KRS
20 635.020.
21 (c) If the District Court determines probable cause exists, the court shall consider
22 the following factors before determining whether the child's case shall be
23 transferred to the Circuit Court:
24 1. The seriousness of the alleged offense;
25 2. Whether the offense was against persons or property, with greater
26 weight being given to offenses against persons;
27 3. The maturity of the child as determined by his or her environment;
Page 19 of 22
XXXX 1/3/2025 11:35 AM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1043
1 4. The child's prior record;
2 5. The best interest of the child and community;
3 6. The prospects of adequate protection of the public;
4 7. The likelihood of reasonable rehabilitation of the child by the use of
5 procedures, services, and facilities currently available to the juvenile
6 justice system;
7 8. Evidence of a child's participation in a gang;
8 9. Whether the child is a defendant with a serious intellectual disability as
9 defined in subsection (4) of this section[in accordance with KRS
10 532.130]; and
11 10. Whether the child used a firearm in the commission of the offense.
12 (d) If, following the completion of the preliminary hearing, the District Court
13 finds, after considering the factors enumerated in paragraph (c) of this
14 subsection, that two (2) or more of the factors specified in paragraph (c) of
15 this subsection are determined to favor transfer, the child may be transferred
16 to Circuit Court, and if the child is transferred the District Court shall issue an
17 order transferring the child as a youthful offender and shall state on the record
18 the reasons for the transfer. The child shall then be proceeded against in the
19 Circuit Court as an adult, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.
20 (e) If, following completion of the preliminary hearing, the District Court is of
21 the opinion, after considering the factors enumerated in paragraph (c) of this
22 subsection, that the child shall not be transferred to the Circuit Court, the case
23 shall be dealt with as provided in KRS Chapter 635.
24 (3) If the child is transferred to Circuit Court under this section and the grand jury does
25 not find that there is probable cause to indict the child as a youthful offender, as
26 defined in KRS 635.020(2) to (8), but does find that there is probable cause to
27 indict the child for another criminal offense, the child shall not be tried as a
Page 20 of 22
XXXX 1/3/2025 11:35 AM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1043
1 youthful offender in Circuit Court but shall be returned to District Court to be dealt
2 with as provided in KRS Chapter 635.
3 (4) As used in this section:
4 (a) "Serious intellectual disability" means significantly subaverage general

12 sentenced to capital punishment. A youthful offender may be sentenced to capital
13 punishment if he was sixteen (16) years of age or older at the time of the
14 commission of the offense. A youthful offender convicted of a capital offense
15 regardless of age may be sentenced to a term of imprisonment appropriate for one
16 who has committed a Class A felony and ]may be sentenced to life imprisonment
17 without benefit of parole[ for twenty-five (25) years].
18 (2) No youthful offender shall be subject to persistent felony offender sentencing under
19 the provisions of KRS 532.080 for offenses committed before the age of eighteen

25 shall be disposed of by the Circuit Court in accordance with the provisions of KRS
26 635.060.

Raw Text:
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1043
1 AN ACT relating to the abolition of the death penalty.
2 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
3 SECTION 1. A NEW SECTION OF KRS CHAPTER 532 IS CREATED TO
4 READ AS FOLLOWS:
5 (1) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, capital punishment by
6 means of the death penalty is abolished as of the effective date of this Act.
7 (2) The court having jurisdiction over a person sentenced to death before the
8 effective date of this Act and for whom the death sentence has not been executed
9 shall sentence that person to imprisonment for life without benefit of probation or
10 parole.
11 Section 2. KRS 422.285 is amended to read as follows:
12 (1) (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, a person who was
13 convicted of a capital offense, a Class A felony, a Class B felony, or any
14 offense designated a violent offense under KRS 439.3401 and who meets the
15 requirements of this section may at any time request the forensic
16 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing and analysis of any evidence that is in
17 the possession or control of the court or Commonwealth, that is related to the
18 investigation or prosecution that resulted in the judgment of conviction and
19 that may contain biological evidence.
20 (b) This subsection shall not apply to offenses under KRS Chapter 218A, unless
21 the offense was accompanied by another offense outside of that chapter for
22 which testing is authorized by paragraph (a) of this subsection.
23 (2) Upon receipt of a request under this section accompanied by a supporting affidavit
24 containing sufficient factual averments to support the request from a person who
25 meets the requirements of subsection (5)(f) of this section at the time the request is
26 made for an offense to which the DNA relates, the court shall:
27 (a) If the petitioner is not represented by counsel, appoint the Department of
Page 1 of 22
XXXX 1/3/2025 11:35 AM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1043
1 Public Advocacy to represent the petitioner for purposes of the request,
2 pursuant to KRS 31.110(2)(c); or
3 (b) If the petitioner is represented by counsel or waives appointment of counsel in
4 writing or if the Department of Public Advocacy has previously withdrawn
5 from representation of the petitioner for purposes of the request, require the
6 petitioner to deposit an amount certain with the court sufficient to cover the
7 reasonable costs of the testing being requested.
8 (3) Counsel representing the petitioner shall be provided a reasonable opportunity to
9 investigate the petitioner's request and shall be permitted to supplement the request.
10 Pursuant to KRS 31.110(2)(c), the petitioner shall have no further right to counsel
11 provided by the Department of Public Advocacy on the matter if counsel
12 determines that it is not a proceeding that a reasonable person with adequate means
13 would be willing to bring at his or her own expense. If the Department of Public
14 Advocacy moves to withdraw as counsel for petitioner and the court grants the
15 motion, the court shall proceed as directed under subsection (2)(b) of this section.
16 (4) Upon receipt of the deposit required under subsection (2)(b) of this section or a
17 motion from counsel provided by the Department of Public Advocacy to proceed,
18 the court shall provide notice to the prosecutor and an opportunity to respond to the
19 petitioner's request.
20 (5) After due consideration of the request and any supplements and responses thereto,
21 the court shall order DNA testing and analysis if the court finds that all of the
22 following apply:
23 (a) A reasonable probability exists that the petitioner would not have been
24 prosecuted or convicted if exculpatory results had been obtained through
25 DNA testing and analysis;
26 (b) The evidence is still in existence and is in a condition that allows DNA testing
27 and analysis to be conducted;
Page 2 of 22

1 (c) The evidence was not previously subjected to DNA testing and analysis or
2 was not subjected to the testing and analysis that is now requested and may
3 resolve an issue not previously resolved by the previous testing and analysis;
4 (d) Except for a petitioner sentenced to death prior to the effective date of this
5 Act, the petitioner was convicted of the offense after a trial or after entering an
6 Alford plea;
7 (e) Except for a petitioner sentenced to death prior to the effective date of this
8 Act, the testing is not sought for touch DNA, meaning casual or limited
9 contact DNA; and

13 (6) After due consideration of the request and any supplements and responses thereto,
14 the court may order DNA testing and analysis if the court finds that all of the
15 following apply:
16 (a) A reasonable probability exists that either:
17 1. The petitioner's verdict or sentence would have been more favorable if
18 the results of DNA testing and analysis had been available at the trial
19 leading to the judgment of conviction; or
20 2. DNA testing and analysis will produce exculpatory evidence;
21 (b) The evidence is still in existence and is in a condition that allows DNA testing
22 and analysis to be conducted;
23 (c) The evidence was not previously subject to DNA testing and analysis or was
24 not subjected to the testing and analysis that is now requested and that may
25 resolve an issue not previously resolved by the previous testing and analysis;

7 the DNA relates.
8 (7) The provisions of KRS 17.176 to the contrary notwithstanding, the petitioner shall
9 pay the costs of all testing and analysis ordered under this section. If the court
10 determines that the petitioner is a needy person using the standards set out in KRS
11 31.120 and the Department of Public Advocacy so moves, the court shall treat the
12 costs of testing and analysis as a direct expense of the defense for the purposes of
13 authorizing payment under KRS 31.185.
14 (8) If the prosecutor or defense counsel has previously subjected evidence to DNA
15 testing and analysis, the court shall order the prosecutor or defense counsel to
16 provide all the parties and the court with access to the laboratory reports that were
17 prepared in connection with the testing and analysis, including underlying data and
18 laboratory notes. If the court orders DNA testing and analysis pursuant to this
19 section, the court shall order the production of any laboratory reports that are
20 prepared in connection with the testing and analysis and may order the production
21 of any underlying data and laboratory notes.
22 (9) If a petition is filed pursuant to this section, the court shall order the state to
23 preserve during the pendency of the proceeding all evidence in the state's
24 possession or control that could be subjected to DNA testing and analysis. The state
25 shall prepare an inventory of the evidence and shall submit a copy of the inventory
26 to the defense and the court. If the evidence is intentionally destroyed after the court
27 orders its preservation, the court may impose appropriate sanctions, including

11 (b) Requesting that the petitioner's sample be added to the Department of
12 Kentucky State Police database; and
13 (c) Providing notification to the victim or family of the victim.
14 (12) Notwithstanding any other provision of law that would bar a hearing as untimely, if
15 the results of the DNA testing and analysis are favorable to the petitioner, the court
16 shall order a hearing and make any further orders that are required pursuant to this
17 section or the Kentucky Rules of Criminal Procedure.

15 probation, probation with an alternative sentencing plan, or conditional discharge.
16 Unless the defendant is a violent offender[felon] as defined in KRS 439.3401 or a
17 statute prohibits probation, shock probation, or conditional discharge, after due
18 consideration of the defendant's risk and needs assessment, nature and
19 circumstances of the crime, and the history, character, and condition of the
20 defendant, probation or conditional discharge shall be granted, unless the court is of

22 (a) There is substantial risk that during a period of probation or conditional
23 discharge the defendant will commit another crime;
24 (b) The defendant is in need of correctional treatment that can be provided most
25 effectively by his or her commitment to a correctional institution; or

1 (3) In the event the court determines that probation is not appropriate after due
2 consideration of the defendant's risk and needs assessment, nature and
3 circumstances of the crime, and the history, character, and condition of the
4 defendant, probation with an alternative sentencing plan shall be granted unless the
5 court is of the opinion that imprisonment is necessary for the protection of the
6 public because:

8 sentencing plan or conditional discharge the defendant will commit a Class D
9 or Class C felony or a substantial risk that the defendant will commit a Class

11 (b) The defendant is in need of correctional treatment that can be provided most
12 effectively by commitment to a correctional institution; or
13 (c) A disposition under this chapter will unduly depreciate the seriousness of the
14 defendant's crime.
15 (4) The court shall not determine that there is a likelihood that the defendant will
16 commit a Class C or Class D felony based upon the defendant's risk and needs
17 assessment and the fact that:
18 (a) The defendant has never been convicted of, pled guilty to, or entered an
19 Alford plea to a felony offense;
20 (b) If convicted of, having pled guilty to, or entered an Alford plea to a felony
21 offense, the defendant successfully completed probation more than ten (10)

25 (c) The defendant has been released from incarceration for the commission of a
26 felony offense more than ten (10) years immediately prior to the date of the

1 has had no intervening convictions, pleas of guilty, or Alford pleas to any
2 criminal offense during that period.
3 (5) In making a determination under subsection (4) of this section, the court may
4 determine that the greater weight of the evidence indicates that there is a likelihood
5 that the defendant will commit a Class C or Class D felony.
6 (6) Upon initial sentencing of a defendant or upon modification or revocation of
7 probation, when the court deems it in the best interest of the public and the
8 defendant, the court may order probation with the defendant to serve one (1) of the
9 following alternative sentences:
10 (a) To a halfway house for no more than twelve (12) months;
11 (b) To home incarceration with or without work release for no more than twelve

22 of the alternative sentence or may modify or revoke probation and alternative
23 sentence and commit the defendant to an institution.
24 (8) In addition to those conditions that the court may impose, the conditions of
25 alternative sentence shall include the following and, if the court determines that the
26 defendant cannot comply with them, then they shall not be made available:

8 as specified in KRS 610.060 have been explained and followed.
9 (2) (a) In the case of a child alleged to be a youthful offender by falling within the
10 purview of KRS 635.020(2) to (8), the District Court shall, upon motion by
11 the county attorney to proceed under this chapter, and after the county

19 prior adjudications, if any, necessary to fall within the purview of KRS
20 635.020.
21 (c) If the District Court determines probable cause exists, the court shall consider
22 the following factors before determining whether the child's case shall be
23 transferred to the Circuit Court:
24 1. The seriousness of the alleged offense;

15 this subsection are determined to favor transfer, the child may be transferred
16 to Circuit Court, and if the child is transferred the District Court shall issue an
17 order transferring the child as a youthful offender and shall state on the record
18 the reasons for the transfer. The child shall then be proceeded against in the
19 Circuit Court as an adult, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.
