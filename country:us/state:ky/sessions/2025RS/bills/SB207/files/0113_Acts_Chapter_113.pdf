CHAPTER 113
( SB 207 )
AN ACT relating to education.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
SECTION 1. A NEW SECTION OF KRS CHAPTER 156 IS CREATED TO READ AS FOLLOWS:
(1) The Kentucky Board of Education, upon the request of the local board of education of a school district,
may grant a waiver from the requirements of an administrative regulation promulgated by the state board
or from a statute over which the state board has authority to enforce. A waiver granted by the state board
shall expire on June 30 of the third full school year after the request was first approved, regardless of
subsequent amendment, unless the state board renews the waiver prior to expiration. The state board shall
not waive any statute or administrative regulation:
(a) Relating to health and safety, including required criminal background checks for staff and
volunteers specified in KRS 160.380 and 161.148;
(b) Relating to civil rights;
(c) Required by federal law;
(d) Relating to compulsory attendance requirements under KRS 158.030 and 158.100 or the recording of
data necessary for participation in the fund to support education excellence in Kentucky;
(e) Establishing certification requirements for teachers in core academic areas, except a waiver may
authorize up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the teaching staff of a school may be employed without
teacher certification if the individual possesses a baccalaureate or graduate degree in the subject the
individual is hired to teach;
(f) Requiring students' participation in state assessment of student performance, as required under KRS
158.6453;
(g) Financial audits, audit procedures, and audit requirements under KRS 156.265;
(h) Open records and open meeting requirements under KRS Chapter 61;
(i) Purchasing requirements and limitations under KRS Chapter 45A and KRS 156.074 and 156.480; or
(j) Requiring instructional time that is at least equivalent to the student instructional year specified in
KRS 158.070.
(2) A waiver request under subsection (1) of this section shall:
(a) Identify the specific statutes and administrative regulations for which the local board is seeking a
waiver;
(b) Specify the schools or programs within the district to which the waiver shall apply;
(c) Explain how the waiver for the schools or programs of each specific statute or administrative
regulation will improve operations or student academic achievement; and
(d) Include any evidence the district wishes to submit to support the request.
(3) Upon the majority vote of a local board approving a waiver request, the superintendent of the district shall
submit the waiver request to the state board. The state board shall consider the waiver of each statute or
administrative regulation included in the request at the next regularly scheduled meeting after submission
and shall either approve or deny the request. In considering approval for each statute or administrative
regulation identified in a waiver request, the state board shall grant the request if it demonstrates that the
waiver is more likely than not:
(a) To improve that school's or program's operation without hindering student academic achievement;
or
(b) To improve student academic achievement at that school or program.

2 ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY
(4) In submitting a waiver request under subsection (3) of this section, a local board may seek to identify the
school or program that is the subject of the request as a school of innovation. In addition to any other
waivers granted for the school or program, a school of innovation shall be granted a waiver from all
statutes and administrative regulations that would prevent the district from entering into an agreement with
an education service provider to assist in the management and operation of the school or program. The
state board shall approve the school of innovation request if the request demonstrates that identification as
a school of innovation is more likely than not to improve either that school's or program's operation or
student academic achievement.
(5) A local board whose request to waive a statute or administrative regulation under subsection (3) or (4) of
this section was denied may amend the original request for reconsideration at the state board's next
regularly scheduled meeting. A local board may request assistance from the Kentucky Department of
Education in the development of the local board's waiver request or an amendment.
(6) A local board may seek to amend a previously approved waiver request by submitting the amendment for
approval by the state board under the same procedures as the original request.
(7) A local board that is granted a waiver under subsection (3) or (4) of this section may submit a request to
renew the waiver to the state board. A renewal request shall be submitted no earlier than six (6) months
prior to that waiver's expiration. The renewal request shall include evidence of the operational
improvement of the school or program that is subject to the waiver, the academic achievement of the
students enrolled in the schools or program, comparisons of those students with similar students across the
state, and any other evidence of the waiver's benefit to student academic achievement. If the state board
finds that the waiver has had a positive impact on the school's or program's operation or the academic
achievement of students, then the renewal request shall be approved. An approved renewal request shall
extend the waiver for an additional three (3) school years.
(8) Any school that is subject to a waiver shall admit any and all children eligible to attend the school subject to
the local board's policies.
(9) If the state board at any time finds by a two-thirds (2/3) majority vote that a specific waiver previously
granted has hindered school or program operations, endangered students, impeded student academic
achievement, or supported financial malfeasance or criminal activity, then the waiver shall be rescinded.
The existence of a waiver shall not negate the legal duties or professional responsibilities of a district
employee.
(10) The state board shall promulgate administrative regulations in accordance with KRS Chapter 13A to adopt
a standardized waiver request form and establish any procedures for processing waiver requests in
compliance with this section.
Section 2. KRS 156.160 is amended to read as follows:
(1) With the advice of the Local Superintendents Advisory Council, the Kentucky Board of Education shall
promulgate administrative regulations establishing standards which school districts shall meet in student,

who does not have a Social Security number or whose parents or guardians choose not to disclose the
Social Security number for the student;

(2) [(a) At the request of a local board of education or a school council, a local school district superintendent
shall request that the Kentucky Board of Education waive any administrative regulation promulgated by
that board. Beginning in the 1996-97 school year, a request for waiver of any administrative regulation
shall be submitted to the Kentucky Board of Education in writing with appropriate justification for the

of the local school district.
Section 3. KRS 156.445 is amended to read as follows:
(1) No textbook or program shall be used in any public school in Kentucky as a basal title unless it has been
recommended and listed on the state multiple list by the State Textbook Commission or unless a school and
district has met the notification requirements under subsection (2) of this section. Any changes of textbooks
made by the State Textbook Commission shall not become effective until grades and classes of the respective
county and independent school districts have completed work for which the adopted book then in use was
originally intended. Nothing in this section shall apply to the supplementary books that are needed from time
to time.
(2) A school council, or if none exists, the principal, may notify, through the superintendent, the State Textbook
Commission that it plans to adopt a basal textbook or program that is not on the recommended list by
submitting evidence that the title it has chosen meets the selection criteria of the State Textbook Commission
in KRS 156.405(3)(b) and the subject specific criteria of the textbook reviewers pursuant to KRS 156.407(5)
and complies with the required publisher specifications.
(3) In approving text materials for private and parochial schools for the purpose of KRS 156.160(2)[(3)] the text
materials shall be approved if they are comprehensive and appropriate to the grade level in question
notwithstanding the fact that they may contain elements of religious philosophy.
Section 4. KRS 157.360 is amended to read as follows:
(1) (a) In determining the cost of the program to support education excellence in Kentucky, the statewide
guaranteed base funding level, as defined in KRS 157.320, shall be computed by dividing the amount
appropriated for this purpose by the prior year's statewide average daily attendance.
(b) When determining the biennial appropriations for the program, the average daily attendance for each
fiscal year shall include an estimate of the number of students graduating early under the provisions of
KRS 158.142.
(2) Each district shall receive an amount equal to the base funding level for each pupil in average daily attendance
in the district in the previous year, except a district shall receive an amount equal to one-half (1/2) of the state
portion of the average statewide per pupil guaranteed base funding level for each student who graduated early
under the provisions of KRS 158.142. Each district's base funding level shall be adjusted by the following
factors:
(a) The number of at-risk students in the district. At-risk students shall be identified as those approved for
the free lunch program under state and federal guidelines. The number of at-risk students shall be
multiplied by a factor to be established by the General Assembly. Funds generated under this paragraph
may be used to pay for:
1. Alternative programs for students who are at risk of dropping out of school before achieving a
diploma; and
2. A hazardous duty pay supplement as determined by the local board of education to the teachers
who work in alternative programs with students who are violent or assaultive;

6 ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY
(b) The number and types of exceptional children in the district as defined by KRS 157.200. Specific
weights for each category of exceptionality shall be used in the calculation of the add-on factor for
exceptional children; and
(c) Transportation costs. The per-pupil cost of transportation shall be calculated as provided by KRS
157.370. Districts which contract to furnish transportation to students attending nonpublic schools may
adopt any payment formula which ensures that no public school funds are used for the transportation of
nonpublic students.
(3) Beginning with the 2015-2016 school year and each year thereafter, the General Assembly shall annually
allocate funds equal to one-half (1/2) of the state portion of the average statewide per pupil guaranteed base
funding level for each student who graduated early under the provisions of KRS 158.142 the previous school
year to the Kentucky Higher Education Assistance Authority for deposit in the early graduation scholarship
trust fund.
(4) The program to support education excellence in Kentucky shall be fully implemented by the 1994-95 school
year.
(5) (a) Except for those schools which have implemented school-based decision making, the commissioner of
education shall enforce maximum class sizes for every academic course requirement in all grades
except in vocal and instrumental music, and physical education classes. Except as provided in
subsection (6) of this section, the maximum number of pupils enrolled in a class shall be as follows:
1. Twenty-four (24) in primary grades (kindergarten through third grade);
2. Twenty-eight (28) in grade four (4);
3. Twenty-nine (29) in grades five (5) and six (6);
4. Thirty-one (31) in grades seven (7) to twelve (12).
(b) Except for those schools which have implemented school-based decision making, class size loads for
middle and secondary school classroom teachers shall not exceed the equivalent of one hundred fifty
(150) pupil hours per day.
(c) The commissioner of education, upon approval of the Kentucky Board of Education, shall adopt
administrative regulations for enforcing this provision. These administrative regulations shall include
procedures for a superintendent to request an exemption from the Kentucky Board of Education when
unusual circumstances warrant an increased class size for an individual class. A request for an
exemption shall include specific reasons for the increased class size with a plan for reducing the class
size prior to the beginning of the next school year. A district shall not receive in any one (1) year
exemptions for more classes than enroll twenty percent (20%) of the pupils in the primary grades and
grades four (4) through eight (8).
(d) In all schools the commissioner of education shall enforce the special education maximum class sizes
set by administrative regulations adopted by the Kentucky Board of Education. A superintendent may
request an exemption pursuant to paragraph (c) of this subsection. A local school council may request a
waiver relating to maximum class size pursuant to Section 1 of this Act in the same manner as a local
board of education[KRS 156.160(2)]. An exemption or waiver shall not be granted if the increased
class size will impede any exceptional child from achieving his or her individual education program in
the least restrictive environment.
(6) In grades four (4) through six (6) with combined grades, the maximum class size shall be the average daily
attendance upon which funding is appropriated for the lowest assigned grade in the class. There shall be no
exceptions to the maximum class size for combined classes. In combined classes other than the primary
grades, no ungraded students shall be placed in a combined class with graded students. In addition, there shall
be no more than two (2) consecutive grade levels combined in any one (1) class in grades four (4) through six
(6). However, this shall not apply to schools which have implemented school-based decision making.
(7) If a local school district, through its admission and release committee, determines that an appropriate program
in the least restrictive environment for a particular child with a disability includes either part-time or full-time
enrollment with a private school or agency within the state or a public or private agency in another state, the
school district shall count as average daily attendance in a public school the time that the child is in attendance
at the school or agency, contingent upon approval by the commissioner of education.

CHAPTER 113 7
(8) Pupils attending a center for child learning and study established under an agreement pursuant to KRS 65.210
to 65.300 shall, for the purpose of calculating average daily attendance, be considered as in attendance in the
school district in which the child legally resides and which is party to the agreement. For purposes of
subsection (1) of this section, teachers who are actually employees of the joint or cooperative action shall be
considered as employees of each school district which is a party to the agreement.
(9) Program funding shall be increased when the average daily attendance in any district for the first two (2)
months of the current school year is greater than the average daily attendance of the district for the first two (2)
months of the previous school year. The program funds allotted the district shall be increased by the percent of
increase. The average daily attendance in kindergarten is the kindergarten full-time equivalent pupils in
average daily attendance.
(10) If the average daily attendance for the current school year in any district decreases by ten percent (10%) or
more than the average daily attendance for the previous school year, the average daily attendance for purposes
of calculating program funding for the next school year shall be increased by an amount equal to two-thirds
(2/3) of the decrease in average daily attendance. If the average daily attendance remains the same or decreases
in the succeeding school year, the average daily attendance for purposes of calculating program funding for the
following school year shall be increased by an amount equal to one-third (1/3) of the decrease for the first year
of the decline.
(11) If the percentage of attendance of any school district shall have been reduced more than two percent (2%)
during the previous school year, the program funding allotted the district for the current school year shall be
increased by the difference in the percentage of attendance for the two (2) years immediately prior to the
current school year less two percent (2%).
(12) (a) Instructional salaries for vocational agriculture classes shall be for twelve (12) months per year.
Vocational agriculture teachers shall be responsible for the following program of instruction during the
time period beyond the regular school term established by the local board of education: supervision and
instruction of students in agriculture experience programs; group and individual instruction of farmers
and agribusinessmen; supervision of student members of agricultural organizations who are involved in
leadership training or other activity required by state or federal law; or any program of vocational
agriculture established by the Department of Education. During extended employment, no vocational
agriculture teacher shall receive salary on a day that the teacher is scheduled to attend an institution of
higher education class which could be credited toward meeting any certification requirement.
(b) Each teacher of agriculture employed shall submit an annual plan for summer program to the local
school superintendent for approval. The summer plan shall include a list of tasks to be performed,
purposes for each task, and time to be spent on each task. Approval by the local school superintendent
shall be in compliance with the guidelines developed by the Department of Education. The supervision
and accountability of teachers of vocational agriculture's summer programs shall be the responsibility of
the local school superintendent. The local school superintendent shall submit to the commissioner of
education a completed report of summer tasks for each vocational agriculture teacher. Twenty percent
(20%) of the approved vocational agriculture programs shall be audited annually by the State
Department of Education to determine that the summer plan has been properly executed.
(13) (a) In allotting program funds for home and hospital instruction, statewide guaranteed base funding,
excluding the capital outlay, shall be allotted for each child in average daily attendance in the prior
school year who has been properly identified according to Kentucky Board of Education administrative
regulations. Attendance shall be calculated pursuant to KRS 157.270 and shall be reported monthly on
forms provided by the Department of Education; and
(b) Pursuant to administrative regulations of the Kentucky Board of Education, local school districts shall
be reimbursed for home and hospital instruction for pupils unable to attend regular school sessions
because of short-term health impairments. A reimbursement formula shall be established by
administrative regulations to include such factors as a reasonable per hour, per child allotment for
teacher instructional time, with a maximum number of funded hours per week, a reasonable allotment
for teaching supplies and equipment, and a reasonable allotment for travel expenses to and from
instructional assignments, but the formula shall not include an allotment for capital outlay. Attendance
shall be calculated pursuant to KRS 157.270 and shall be reported annually on forms provided by the
Department of Education.

value of the real estate used in this calculation shall be the lesser of the current year assessment or the prior
year assessment increased by four percent (4%) plus the value of current year new property. The calculation
under this subsection shall be subject to available funds.
(18) Notwithstanding any other statute or budget of the Commonwealth language to the contrary, time missed due

individuals to become certified Kentucky teachers and render teaching service in Kentucky schools.
(2) For purposes of this section, the terms listed below shall have the following meanings:
(a) "Critical shortage area" means an understaffing of teachers in particular subject matters at the secondary
level, in grade levels, or in geographic locations at the elementary and secondary level, as determined
by the commissioner of education in consultation with the authority. The commissioner and the

(c) "Eligible program of study" means an undergraduate or graduate program of study which is preparatory
to teacher certification;

(70) days each semester in a public school of the Commonwealth or a private school certified pursuant
to KRS 156.160(2)[(3)], except that an individual having a disability defined by Title II of the
Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. secs. 12131 et seq.) or serious and extended illness, whose
disability or illness, certified by a licensed physician, prevents that individual from teaching a major
portion of each school day, shall be deemed to perform qualified teaching service by teaching the
maximum time permitted by the attending physician;
(g) "Semester" means a period of about eighteen (18) weeks, which usually makes up one-half (1/2) of a
school year or one-half (1/2) of a participating institution's academic year; and
(h) "Summer term" means an academic period consisting of one (1) or more sessions of instruction between
a spring and a fall semester.

demonstrate financial need in accordance with standards and criteria established by the authority or received
teacher scholarships pursuant to this section prior to July 1, 1996. Each teacher scholarship shall be evidenced
by a promissory note that requires repayment or cancellation pursuant to subsection (6) of this section.
(4) Kentucky residents who are United States citizens and enrolled or accepted for enrollment in an eligible

certification. If funds are not depleted after awarding teacher scholarships to students who meet the preceding
criteria, then awards shall be made to any otherwise eligible students.
(5) The authority shall establish, by administrative regulation, the maximum amount of scholarship to be awarded
for each semester and summer term under this section. The amount of each scholarship to be awarded shall not
exceed the applicant's total cost of education minus other financial assistance received or expected to be
received by the applicant during the academic period.

person who is in default on any obligation to the authority under any program administered by the
authority pursuant to KRS 164.740 to 164.785 until financial obligations to the authority are satisfied,
except that ineligibility for this reason may be waived by the authority for cause.
(c) Recipients shall render one (1) semester of qualified teaching service for each semester or summer term
of scholarship received, except that recipients who teach in a critical shortage area designated by the

semester of qualified teaching service as repayment for two (2) semesters or summer terms of
scholarships received. Upon completion of each semester of qualified teacher service, the authority
shall cancel the appropriate number of promissory notes.

institution or fails to render qualified teaching service in any semester following certification or
recertification, unless the failure is temporarily waived for cause by the authority, the recipient shall
immediately become liable to the authority for repayment of the sum of all outstanding promissory
notes and accrued interest. Persons liable for repayment of scholarships under this paragraph shall be
liable for interest accruing from the dates on which the teacher scholarships were disbursed.

164.770 respectively, and who render qualified teaching service, shall have their notes canceled in
accordance with subsection (6)(c) of this section.

a promissory note under this section shall be eight percent (8%) per annum, except that if a judgment is
rendered to recover payment, the judgment shall bear interest at the rate of five percent (5%) greater
than the rate actually charged on the promissory note.
(7) A repayment obligation imposed by this section shall not be voidable by reason of the age of the recipient at
the time of receiving the teacher scholarship.
(8) Failure to meet repayment obligations imposed by this section shall be cause for the revocation of a person's
teaching certificate, subject to the procedures set forth in KRS 161.120.
(9) All moneys repaid to the authority under this section shall be added to the appropriations made for purposes of
this section, and the funds and unobligated appropriations shall not lapse.
(10) The authority may execute appropriate contracts and promissory notes for administering this section.
(11) Notwithstanding any other statute to the contrary, if available funds are insufficient for all requested
scholarships for eligible applicants during any fiscal year, the authority shall give priority consideration to
eligible applicants who previously received teacher scholarships and, until June 30, 2018, to loan forgiveness
for teachers who have outstanding loan balance eligibility for Best in Class loans issued prior to June 30, 2008.
If funds are insufficient to make all requested renewal scholarships to eligible applicants, the authority shall
reduce all scholarship awards to the extent necessary to provide scholarships to all qualified renewal
applicants. If, after awarding all eligible renewal applicants, funds are not depleted, initial applications shall be
ranked according to regulatory selection criteria, which may include expected family contribution and
application date, and awards shall be made to highly qualified applicants until funds are depleted.
(12) The authority shall submit a report on the number of teacher scholarships provided in each fiscal year, the
program of study in which recipients are enrolled, recipient retention rates, total number of applications, and
scholarship recruitment strategies to the Interim Joint Committee on Education by December 1 of each year.
