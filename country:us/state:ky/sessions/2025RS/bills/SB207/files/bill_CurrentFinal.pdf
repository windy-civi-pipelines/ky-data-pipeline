7 administrative regulation promulgated by the state board or from a statute over
8 which the state board has authority to enforce. A waiver granted by the state
9 board shall expire on June 30 of the third full school year after the request was
10 first approved, regardless of subsequent amendment, unless the state board
11 renews the waiver prior to expiration. The state board shall not waive any statute
12 or administrative regulation:
13 (a) Relating to health and safety, including required criminal background

15 (b) Relating to civil rights;
16 (c) Required by federal law;

20 (e) Establishing certification requirements for teachers in core academic areas,
21 except a waiver may authorize up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the
22 teaching staff of a school may be employed without teacher certification if
23 the individual possesses a baccalaureate or graduate degree in the subject
24 the individual is hired to teach;
25 (f) Requiring students' participation in state assessment of student

1 156.265;
2 (h) Open records and open meeting requirements under KRS Chapter 61;
3 (i) Purchasing requirements and limitations under KRS Chapter 45A and KRS
4 156.074 and 156.480; or
5 (j) Requiring instructional time that is at least equivalent to the student
6 instructional year specified in KRS 158.070.
7 (2) A waiver request under subsection (1) of this section shall:
8 (a) Identify the specific statutes and administrative regulations for which the
9 local board is seeking a waiver;
10 (b) Specify the schools or programs within the district to which the waiver shall
11 apply;
12 (c) Explain how the waiver for the schools or programs of each specific statute
13 or administrative regulation will improve operations or student academic
14 achievement; and
15 (d) Include any evidence the district wishes to submit to support the request.
16 (3) Upon the majority vote of a local board approving a waiver request, the
17 superintendent of the district shall submit the waiver request to the state board.
18 The state board shall consider the waiver of each statute or administrative
19 regulation included in the request at the next regularly scheduled meeting after
20 submission and shall either approve or deny the request. In considering approval
21 for each statute or administrative regulation identified in a waiver request, the
22 state board shall grant the request if it demonstrates that the waiver is more likely
23 than not:
24 (a) To improve that school's or program's operation without hindering student
25 academic achievement; or
26 (b) To improve student academic achievement at that school or program.
27 (4) In submitting a waiver request under subsection (3) of this section, a local board

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS SB 207/VO
1 may seek to identify the school or program that is the subject of the request as a
2 school of innovation. In addition to any other waivers granted for the school or
3 program, a school of innovation shall be granted a waiver from all statutes and
4 administrative regulations that would prevent the district from entering into an
5 agreement with an education service provider to assist in the management and
6 operation of the school or program. The state board shall approve the school of
7 innovation request if the request demonstrates that identification as a school of
8 innovation is more likely than not to improve either that school's or program's
9 operation or student academic achievement.
10 (5) A local board whose request to waive a statute or administrative regulation under
11 subsection (3) or (4) of this section was denied may amend the original request
12 for reconsideration at the state board's next regularly scheduled meeting. A local
13 board may request assistance from the Kentucky Department of Education in the
14 development of the local board's waiver request or an amendment.
15 (6) A local board may seek to amend a previously approved waiver request by
16 submitting the amendment for approval by the state board under the same
17 procedures as the original request.
18 (7) A local board that is granted a waiver under subsection (3) or (4) of this section
19 may submit a request to renew the waiver to the state board. A renewal request
20 shall be submitted no earlier than six (6) months prior to that waiver's expiration.
21 The renewal request shall include evidence of the operational improvement of the
22 school or program that is subject to the waiver, the academic achievement of the
23 students enrolled in the schools or program, comparisons of those students with
24 similar students across the state, and any other evidence of the waiver's benefit to
25 student academic achievement. If the state board finds that the waiver has had a
26 positive impact on the school's or program's operation or the academic
27 achievement of students, then the renewal request shall be approved. An

1 approved renewal request shall extend the waiver for an additional three (3)
2 school years.
3 (8) Any school that is subject to a waiver shall admit any and all children eligible to
4 attend the school subject to the local board's policies.
5 (9) If the state board at any time finds by a two-thirds (2/3) majority vote that a
6 specific waiver previously granted has hindered school or program operations,
7 endangered students, impeded student academic achievement, or supported
8 financial malfeasance or criminal activity, then the waiver shall be rescinded.
9 The existence of a waiver shall not negate the legal duties or professional
10 responsibilities of a district employee.
11 (10) The state board shall promulgate administrative regulations in accordance with
12 KRS Chapter 13A to adopt a standardized waiver request form and establish any
13 procedures for processing waiver requests in compliance with this section.
14 Section 2. KRS 156.160 is amended to read as follows:
15 (1) With the advice of the Local Superintendents Advisory Council, the Kentucky
16 Board of Education shall promulgate administrative regulations establishing
17 standards which school districts shall meet in student, program, service, and
18 operational performance. These regulations shall comply with the expected
19 outcomes for students and schools set forth in KRS 158.6451. Administrative
20 regulations shall be promulgated for the following:

24 daily attendance for each fiscal year shall include an estimate of the number
25 of students graduating early under the provisions of KRS 158.142.
26 (2) Each district shall receive an amount equal to the base funding level for each pupil
27 in average daily attendance in the district in the previous year, except a district shall

1 receive an amount equal to one-half (1/2) of the state portion of the average
2 statewide per pupil guaranteed base funding level for each student who graduated
3 early under the provisions of KRS 158.142. Each district's base funding level shall
4 be adjusted by the following factors:
5 (a) The number of at-risk students in the district. At-risk students shall be
6 identified as those approved for the free lunch program under state and federal
7 guidelines. The number of at-risk students shall be multiplied by a factor to be
8 established by the General Assembly. Funds generated under this paragraph

13 education to the teachers who work in alternative programs with
14 students who are violent or assaultive;
15 (b) The number and types of exceptional children in the district as defined by
16 KRS 157.200. Specific weights for each category of exceptionality shall be
17 used in the calculation of the add-on factor for exceptional children; and
18 (c) Transportation costs. The per-pupil cost of transportation shall be calculated
19 as provided by KRS 157.370. Districts which contract to furnish
20 transportation to students attending nonpublic schools may adopt any payment
21 formula which ensures that no public school funds are used for the
22 transportation of nonpublic students.
23 (3) Beginning with the 2015-2016 school year and each year thereafter, the General
24 Assembly shall annually allocate funds equal to one-half (1/2) of the state portion

26 who graduated early under the provisions of KRS 158.142 the previous school year
27 to the Kentucky Higher Education Assistance Authority for deposit in the early

1 graduation scholarship trust fund.
2 (4) The program to support education excellence in Kentucky shall be fully
3 implemented by the 1994-95 school year.
4 (5) (a) Except for those schools which have implemented school-based decision
5 making, the commissioner of education shall enforce maximum class sizes for
6 every academic course requirement in all grades except in vocal and
7 instrumental music, and physical education classes. Except as provided in
8 subsection (6) of this section, the maximum number of pupils enrolled in a
9 class shall be as follows:
10 1. Twenty-four (24) in primary grades (kindergarten through third grade);
11 2. Twenty-eight (28) in grade four (4);

13 4. Thirty-one (31) in grades seven (7) to twelve (12).
14 (b) Except for those schools which have implemented school-based decision
15 making, class size loads for middle and secondary school classroom teachers
16 shall not exceed the equivalent of one hundred fifty (150) pupil hours per day.
17 (c) The commissioner of education, upon approval of the Kentucky Board of
18 Education, shall adopt administrative regulations for enforcing this provision.
19 These administrative regulations shall include procedures for a superintendent
20 to request an exemption from the Kentucky Board of Education when unusual
21 circumstances warrant an increased class size for an individual class. A
22 request for an exemption shall include specific reasons for the increased class
23 size with a plan for reducing the class size prior to the beginning of the next
24 school year. A district shall not receive in any one (1) year exemptions for
25 more classes than enroll twenty percent (20%) of the pupils in the primary
26 grades and grades four (4) through eight (8).
27 (d) In all schools the commissioner of education shall enforce the special

1 education maximum class sizes set by administrative regulations adopted by
2 the Kentucky Board of Education. A superintendent may request an
3 exemption pursuant to paragraph (c) of this subsection. A local school council
4 may request a waiver relating to maximum class size pursuant to Section 1 of
5 this Act in the same manner as a local board of education[KRS 156.160(2)].
6 An exemption or waiver shall not be granted if the increased class size will
7 impede any exceptional child from achieving his or her individual education
8 program in the least restrictive environment.
9 (6) In grades four (4) through six (6) with combined grades, the maximum class size
10 shall be the average daily attendance upon which funding is appropriated for the
11 lowest assigned grade in the class. There shall be no exceptions to the maximum
12 class size for combined classes. In combined classes other than the primary grades,
13 no ungraded students shall be placed in a combined class with graded students. In
14 addition, there shall be no more than two (2) consecutive grade levels combined in
15 any one (1) class in grades four (4) through six (6). However, this shall not apply to
16 schools which have implemented school-based decision making.
17 (7) If a local school district, through its admission and release committee, determines
18 that an appropriate program in the least restrictive environment for a particular child
19 with a disability includes either part-time or full-time enrollment with a private
20 school or agency within the state or a public or private agency in another state, the
21 school district shall count as average daily attendance in a public school the time
22 that the child is in attendance at the school or agency, contingent upon approval by
23 the commissioner of education.
24 (8) Pupils attending a center for child learning and study established under an
25 agreement pursuant to KRS 65.210 to 65.300 shall, for the purpose of calculating
26 average daily attendance, be considered as in attendance in the school district in
27 which the child legally resides and which is party to the agreement. For purposes of

1 subsection (1) of this section, teachers who are actually employees of the joint or
2 cooperative action shall be considered as employees of each school district which is
3 a party to the agreement.
4 (9) Program funding shall be increased when the average daily attendance in any
5 district for the first two (2) months of the current school year is greater than the
6 average daily attendance of the district for the first two (2) months of the previous
7 school year. The program funds allotted the district shall be increased by the
8 percent of increase. The average daily attendance in kindergarten is the
9 kindergarten full-time equivalent pupils in average daily attendance.
10 (10) If the average daily attendance for the current school year in any district decreases
11 by ten percent (10%) or more than the average daily attendance for the previous
12 school year, the average daily attendance for purposes of calculating program
13 funding for the next school year shall be increased by an amount equal to two-thirds
14 (2/3) of the decrease in average daily attendance. If the average daily attendance
