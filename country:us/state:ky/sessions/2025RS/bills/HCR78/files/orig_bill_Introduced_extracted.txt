Section 1:
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1974
2 Resiliency Task Force to study disaster mitigation, risk assessment, infrastructure
3 resilience, and planning for natural disasters that impact the Commonwealth.
4 WHEREAS, the protection of human life and property is a fundamental
5 responsibility of the government of the Commonwealth of Kentucky; and
6 WHEREAS, the Commonwealth is susceptible to various natural and manmade
7 disaster events, posing threats to the well-being of its citizens, integrity of its
8 infrastructure, prospects for its economic growth, and maintenance and protection of its
9 unique lands and water areas and applicable natural resources. These threats additionally
10 pose significant fiscal and operational risks to functions of the Commonwealth’s
11 government; and
12 WHEREAS, the Commonwealth has experienced an increase in the occurrence and
13 magnitude of natural disasters, including flooding and tornadoes, as a result of shifting
14 weather patterns. Between 2011 and 2023, Kentucky experienced 20 Major Disaster
15 Declarations, which is the sixth most in the United States in that timeframe. Nationally,
16 eight of ten counties with the highest number of Major Disaster Declarations between
17 2011 and 2023 were located in the Commonwealth of Kentucky; and
18 WHEREAS, catastrophic flooding in July 2022 impacted a wide swath of the
19 Commonwealth, leading to at least 44 deaths and nearly 9,000 homes damaged or
20 destroyed. Kentucky has experienced numerous episodes of catastrophic flooding
21 resulting from intense rain and storms. These events highlight the need for a statewide
22 plan to accommodate and mitigate flooding impacts in the Commonwealth, matching
23 states across the country which are increasingly responding to more frequent and extreme
24 weather events; and
25 WHEREAS, Kentucky is additionally susceptible to other extreme weather hazards,
26 such as landslides, wildfire, drought, and extreme heat. Atmospheric cycles combined
27 with changes in land use and other activities may further exacerbate these hazard risks in

1 the future; and
2 WHEREAS, the ability to execute timely and effective response and recovery
3 operations are essential when the Commonwealth experiences devastating natural
4 disasters. The Commonwealth will benefit from a coordinated and collaborative effort to
5 develop comprehensive responses and solutions to protect Kentucky and its citizens,
6 businesses, and natural resources emphasizing the need to assess current risks and
7 analyze projected future conditions; and
8 WHEREAS, understanding the effect of environmental disasters and the available
9 resources allocated for relief is essential for limiting the impact following such events. In
10 these endeavors, it is vital that this Commonwealth develop a comprehensive approach to
11 resilience to accommodate and mitigate current and future disaster events to lessen the
12 negative effects to Kentucky’s economy and to facilitate economic development, promote
13 tourism, and assist communities and businesses struggling with repeated disaster impacts;
14 and
15 WHEREAS, preparedness efforts to prevent and mitigate natural disasters are
16 crucial to ensuring the safety and protection of the citizens of the Commonwealth in
17 future weather-related calamities. A coordinated Commonwealth, local, and community
18 effort is necessary and appropriate to facilitate the interaction and effective collaboration
19 between various government entities and the private and academic sectors to address
20 these issues; and
21 WHEREAS, the General Assembly wishes to assess needs, gaps, and opportunities
22 to increase disaster resilience throughout the entirety of the Commonwealth and
23 recommend policy measures to advance those desired outcomes; and
24 WHEREAS, the General Assembly seeks expert opinions and research from a
25 variety of reputable institutions and policymakers, including those representing county
26 and municipal governments, that can provide relevant and pertinent information
27 regarding approaches to affirmatively increase resilience across the Commonwealth in
