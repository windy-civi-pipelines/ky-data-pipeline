1 AN ACT relating to student attendance days and declaring an emergency.
2 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
3 Section 1. Notwithstanding the requirement in KRS 158.070 that the student
4 instructional year be not less than 170 student attendance days and any other statute or
5 administrative regulation to the contrary, a school which had one or more attendance days
6 that were planned in a school calendar during the month of September 2024 but was
7 cancelled due to dangers posed by criminal activity may be granted a waiver and receive
8 credit for those days. To request a waiver, a school district shall submit to the
9 commissioner of education evidence of school closings and evidence that the closings
10 were due to dangers posed by criminal activity. A waiver request shall be submitted by
11 May 1, 2025, and may be for closures of specific schools or of the entire school district.
12 Upon submission of the evidence, the commissioner of education shall grant the waiver.
13 Section 2. Whereas student attendance day waivers impact the allocation of
14 school resources for the current school year, an emergency is declared to exist, and this
15 Act takes effect upon its passage and approval by the Governor or upon its otherwise
16 becoming a law.
