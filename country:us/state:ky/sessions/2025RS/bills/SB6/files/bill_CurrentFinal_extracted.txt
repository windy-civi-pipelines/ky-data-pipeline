2 Section 2. KRS 157.330 is amended to read as follows:
3 (1) There is hereby established the fund to support education excellence in Kentucky

9 Section 3. KRS 157.360 is amended to read as follows:
10 (1) (a) In determining the cost of the program to support education excellence in

12 157.320, shall be computed by dividing the amount appropriated for this
13 purpose by the prior year's statewide average daily attendance.
14 (b) When determining the biennial appropriations for the program, the average
15 daily attendance for each fiscal year shall include an estimate of the number
16 of students graduating early under the provisions of KRS 158.142.
17 (2) Each district shall receive an amount equal to the base funding level for each pupil
18 in average daily attendance in the district in the previous year, except a district shall
19 receive an amount equal to one-half (1/2) of the state portion of the average
20 statewide per pupil guaranteed base funding level for each student who graduated

8 used in the calculation of the add-on factor for exceptional children;[ and]
9 (c) Transportation costs. The per-pupil cost of transportation shall be calculated
10 as provided by KRS 157.370. Districts which contract to furnish
11 transportation to students attending nonpublic schools may adopt any payment
12 formula which ensures that no public school funds are used for the
13 transportation of nonpublic students; and
14 (d) Fringe benefit costs as defined in Section 1 of this Act, which shall not be
15 distributed to districts.

SB000610.100 - 1647 - XXXX 3/4/2025 3:34 PM GA
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS SB 6/GA
1 subsection (6) of this section, the maximum number of pupils enrolled in a
2 class shall be as follows:
3 1. Twenty-four (24) in primary grades (kindergarten through third grade);
4 2. Twenty-eight (28) in grade four (4);
5 3. Twenty-nine (29) in grades five (5) and six (6);
6 4. Thirty-one (31) in grades seven (7) to twelve (12).
7 (b) Except for those schools which have implemented school-based decision
8 making, class size loads for middle and secondary school classroom teachers
9 shall not exceed the equivalent of one hundred fifty (150) pupil hours per day.
10 (c) The commissioner of education, upon approval of the Kentucky Board of
11 Education, shall adopt administrative regulations for enforcing this provision.
12 These administrative regulations shall include procedures for a superintendent
13 to request an exemption from the Kentucky Board of Education when unusual
14 circumstances warrant an increased class size for an individual class. A
15 request for an exemption shall include specific reasons for the increased class
16 size with a plan for reducing the class size prior to the beginning of the next
17 school year. A district shall not receive in any one (1) year exemptions for

23 exemption pursuant to paragraph (c) of this subsection. A local school council
24 may request a waiver pursuant to KRS 156.160(2). An exemption or waiver
25 shall not be granted if the increased class size will impede any exceptional
26 child from achieving his or her individual education program in the least
27 restrictive environment.

1 (6) In grades four (4) through six (6) with combined grades, the maximum class size
2 shall be the average daily attendance upon which funding is appropriated for the
3 lowest assigned grade in the class. There shall be no exceptions to the maximum
4 class size for combined classes. In combined classes other than the primary grades,
5 no ungraded students shall be placed in a combined class with graded students. In
6 addition, there shall be no more than two (2) consecutive grade levels combined in
7 any one (1) class in grades four (4) through six (6). However, this shall not apply to
8 schools which have implemented school-based decision making.
9 (7) If a local school district, through its admission and release committee, determines
10 that an appropriate program in the least restrictive environment for a particular child
11 with a disability includes either part-time or full-time enrollment with a private
12 school or agency within the state or a public or private agency in another state, the
13 school district shall count as average daily attendance in a public school the time
14 that the child is in attendance at the school or agency, contingent upon approval by
15 the commissioner of education.
16 (8) Pupils attending a center for child learning and study established under an
17 agreement pursuant to KRS 65.210 to 65.300 shall, for the purpose of calculating
18 average daily attendance, be considered as in attendance in the school district in
19 which the child legally resides and which is party to the agreement. For purposes of
20 subsection (1) of this section, teachers who are actually employees of the joint or
21 cooperative action shall be considered as employees of each school district which is
22 a party to the agreement.
23 (9) Program funding shall be increased when the average daily attendance in any
24 district for the first two (2) months of the current school year is greater than the
25 average daily attendance of the district for the first two (2) months of the previous
26 school year. The program funds allotted the district shall be increased by the
27 percent of increase. The average daily attendance in kindergarten is the
Page 8 of 12
SB000610.100 - 1647 - XXXX 3/4/2025 3:34 PM GA
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS SB 6/GA
1 kindergarten full-time equivalent pupils in average daily attendance.
2 (10) If the average daily attendance for the current school year in any district decreases
3 by ten percent (10%) or more than the average daily attendance for the previous
4 school year, the average daily attendance for purposes of calculating program
5 funding for the next school year shall be increased by an amount equal to two-thirds
6 (2/3) of the decrease in average daily attendance. If the average daily attendance
7 remains the same or decreases in the succeeding school year, the average daily
8 attendance for purposes of calculating program funding for the following school
9 year shall be increased by an amount equal to one-third (1/3) of the decrease for the
10 first year of the decline.
11 (11) If the percentage of attendance of any school district shall have been reduced more
12 than two percent (2%) during the previous school year, the program funding
13 allotted the district for the current school year shall be increased by the difference in
14 the percentage of attendance for the two (2) years immediately prior to the current
15 school year less two percent (2%).
16 (12) (a) Instructional salaries for vocational agriculture classes shall be for twelve (12)
17 months per year. Vocational agriculture teachers shall be responsible for the
18 following program of instruction during the time period beyond the regular
19 school term established by the local board of education: supervision and
20 instruction of students in agriculture experience programs; group and
21 individual instruction of farmers and agribusinessmen; supervision of student
22 members of agricultural organizations who are involved in leadership training
23 or other activity required by state or federal law; or any program of vocational
24 agriculture established by the Department of Education. During extended
25 employment, no vocational agriculture teacher shall receive salary on a day
26 that the teacher is scheduled to attend an institution of higher education class
27 which could be credited toward meeting any certification requirement.

1 (b) Each teacher of agriculture employed shall submit an annual plan for summer
2 program to the local school superintendent for approval. The summer plan
3 shall include a list of tasks to be performed, purposes for each task, and time
4 to be spent on each task. Approval by the local school superintendent shall be
5 in compliance with the guidelines developed by the Department of Education.
6 The supervision and accountability of teachers of vocational agriculture's
7 summer programs shall be the responsibility of the local school
8 superintendent. The local school superintendent shall submit to the
9 commissioner of education a completed report of summer tasks for each
10 vocational agriculture teacher. Twenty percent (20%) of the approved
11 vocational agriculture programs shall be audited annually by the State
12 Department of Education to determine that the summer plan has been properly
13 executed.
14 (13) (a) In allotting program funds for home and hospital instruction, statewide
15 guaranteed base funding, excluding the capital outlay, shall be allotted for
16 each child in average daily attendance in the prior school year who has been
17 properly identified according to Kentucky Board of Education administrative
18 regulations. Attendance shall be calculated pursuant to KRS 157.270 and shall
19 be reported monthly on forms provided by the Department of Education; and
20 (b) Pursuant to administrative regulations of the Kentucky Board of Education,
21 local school districts shall be reimbursed for home and hospital instruction for
22 pupils unable to attend regular school sessions because of short-term health
23 impairments. A reimbursement formula shall be established by administrative
24 regulations to include such factors as a reasonable per hour, per child
25 allotment for teacher instructional time, with a maximum number of funded
26 hours per week, a reasonable allotment for teaching supplies and equipment,
27 and a reasonable allotment for travel expenses to and from instructional

1 assignments, but the formula shall not include an allotment for capital outlay.
2 Attendance shall be calculated pursuant to KRS 157.270 and shall be reported
3 annually on forms provided by the Department of Education.
4 (14) Except for those schools which have implemented school-based decision making
5 and the school council has voted to waive this subsection, kindergarten aides shall
6 be provided for each twenty-four (24) full-time equivalent kindergarten students
7 enrolled.
8 (15) Effective July 1, 2001, there shall be no deduction applied against the base funding
9 level for any pupil in average daily attendance who spends a portion of his or her
10 school day in a program at a state-operated career and technical education or
11 vocational facility.
12 (16) During a fiscal year, a school district may request that the Department of Education
13 recalculate its funds allocated under this section if the current year average daily
14 attendance for the twenty (20) day school month as defined in KRS 158.060(1) that
15 contains the most days within the calendar month of January exceeds the prior year
16 adjusted average daily attendance plus growth by at least one percent (1%). Any
17 adjustments in the allotments approved under this subsection shall be proportional
18 to the remaining days in the school year and subject to available funds under the
19 program to support education excellence in Kentucky.
20 (17) To calculate the state portion of the program to support education excellence in
21 Kentucky for a school district, the Department of Education shall subtract the local
22 effort required under KRS 157.390(5) from the calculated base funding under the
23 program to support education excellence in Kentucky, as required by this section.
24 The value of the real estate used in this calculation shall be the lesser of the current
25 year assessment or the prior year assessment increased by four percent (4%) plus
26 the value of current year new property. The calculation under this subsection shall
27 be subject to available funds.

SB000610.100 - 1647 - XXXX 3/4/2025 3:34 PM GA

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS SB 6/GA
1 subsection (6) of this section, the maximum number of pupils enrolled in a
2 class shall be as follows:
3 1. Twenty-four (24) in primary grades (kindergarten through third grade);
4 2. Twenty-eight (28) in grade four (4);
5 3. Twenty-nine (29) in grades five (5) and six (6);
6 4. Thirty-one (31) in grades seven (7) to twelve (12).
7 (b) Except for those schools which have implemented school-based decision
8 making, class size loads for middle and secondary school classroom teachers
9 shall not exceed the equivalent of one hundred fifty (150) pupil hours per day.
10 (c) The commissioner of education, upon approval of the Kentucky Board of
11 Education, shall adopt administrative regulations for enforcing this provision.
12 These administrative regulations shall include procedures for a superintendent
13 to request an exemption from the Kentucky Board of Education when unusual
14 circumstances warrant an increased class size for an individual class. A
15 request for an exemption shall include specific reasons for the increased class
16 size with a plan for reducing the class size prior to the beginning of the next

25 shall not be granted if the increased class size will impede any exceptional
26 child from achieving his or her individual education program in the least
27 restrictive environment.

1 (6) In grades four (4) through six (6) with combined grades, the maximum class size
2 shall be the average daily attendance upon which funding is appropriated for the
3 lowest assigned grade in the class. There shall be no exceptions to the maximum
4 class size for combined classes. In combined classes other than the primary grades,
5 no ungraded students shall be placed in a combined class with graded students. In
6 addition, there shall be no more than two (2) consecutive grade levels combined in
7 any one (1) class in grades four (4) through six (6). However, this shall not apply to
8 schools which have implemented school-based decision making.
9 (7) If a local school district, through its admission and release committee, determines
10 that an appropriate program in the least restrictive environment for a particular child
11 with a disability includes either part-time or full-time enrollment with a private
12 school or agency within the state or a public or private agency in another state, the
13 school district shall count as average daily attendance in a public school the time
14 that the child is in attendance at the school or agency, contingent upon approval by
15 the commissioner of education.
16 (8) Pupils attending a center for child learning and study established under an
17 agreement pursuant to KRS 65.210 to 65.300 shall, for the purpose of calculating
18 average daily attendance, be considered as in attendance in the school district in
19 which the child legally resides and which is party to the agreement. For purposes of
20 subsection (1) of this section, teachers who are actually employees of the joint or
21 cooperative action shall be considered as employees of each school district which is
22 a party to the agreement.
23 (9) Program funding shall be increased when the average daily attendance in any
24 district for the first two (2) months of the current school year is greater than the
25 average daily attendance of the district for the first two (2) months of the previous
26 school year. The program funds allotted the district shall be increased by the
27 percent of increase. The average daily attendance in kindergarten is the
Page 8 of 12
SB000610.100 - 1647 - XXXX 3/4/2025 3:34 PM GA

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS SB 6/GA
1 kindergarten full-time equivalent pupils in average daily attendance.
2 (10) If the average daily attendance for the current school year in any district decreases
3 by ten percent (10%) or more than the average daily attendance for the previous
4 school year, the average daily attendance for purposes of calculating program
5 funding for the next school year shall be increased by an amount equal to two-thirds
6 (2/3) of the decrease in average daily attendance. If the average daily attendance
7 remains the same or decreases in the succeeding school year, the average daily
8 attendance for purposes of calculating program funding for the following school
9 year shall be increased by an amount equal to one-third (1/3) of the decrease for the
10 first year of the decline.
11 (11) If the percentage of attendance of any school district shall have been reduced more
12 than two percent (2%) during the previous school year, the program funding
13 allotted the district for the current school year shall be increased by the difference in
14 the percentage of attendance for the two (2) years immediately prior to the current
15 school year less two percent (2%).
16 (12) (a) Instructional salaries for vocational agriculture classes shall be for twelve (12)
17 months per year. Vocational agriculture teachers shall be responsible for the
18 following program of instruction during the time period beyond the regular
19 school term established by the local board of education: supervision and
20 instruction of students in agriculture experience programs; group and
21 individual instruction of farmers and agribusinessmen; supervision of student
22 members of agricultural organizations who are involved in leadership training
23 or other activity required by state or federal law; or any program of vocational
24 agriculture established by the Department of Education. During extended
25 employment, no vocational agriculture teacher shall receive salary on a day
26 that the teacher is scheduled to attend an institution of higher education class
27 which could be credited toward meeting any certification requirement.

1 (b) Each teacher of agriculture employed shall submit an annual plan for summer
2 program to the local school superintendent for approval. The summer plan
3 shall include a list of tasks to be performed, purposes for each task, and time
4 to be spent on each task. Approval by the local school superintendent shall be
5 in compliance with the guidelines developed by the Department of Education.
6 The supervision and accountability of teachers of vocational agriculture's
7 summer programs shall be the responsibility of the local school
8 superintendent. The local school superintendent shall submit to the
9 commissioner of education a completed report of summer tasks for each
10 vocational agriculture teacher. Twenty percent (20%) of the approved
11 vocational agriculture programs shall be audited annually by the State
12 Department of Education to determine that the summer plan has been properly
13 executed.
14 (13) (a) In allotting program funds for home and hospital instruction, statewide
15 guaranteed base funding, excluding the capital outlay, shall be allotted for
16 each child in average daily attendance in the prior school year who has been
17 properly identified according to Kentucky Board of Education administrative
18 regulations. Attendance shall be calculated pursuant to KRS 157.270 and shall
19 be reported monthly on forms provided by the Department of Education; and
20 (b) Pursuant to administrative regulations of the Kentucky Board of Education,
21 local school districts shall be reimbursed for home and hospital instruction for
22 pupils unable to attend regular school sessions because of short-term health
23 impairments. A reimbursement formula shall be established by administrative
24 regulations to include such factors as a reasonable per hour, per child
25 allotment for teacher instructional time, with a maximum number of funded
26 hours per week, a reasonable allotment for teaching supplies and equipment,
27 and a reasonable allotment for travel expenses to and from instructional

1 assignments, but the formula shall not include an allotment for capital outlay.
2 Attendance shall be calculated pursuant to KRS 157.270 and shall be reported
3 annually on forms provided by the Department of Education.
4 (14) Except for those schools which have implemented school-based decision making
5 and the school council has voted to waive this subsection, kindergarten aides shall
6 be provided for each twenty-four (24) full-time equivalent kindergarten students
7 enrolled.
8 (15) Effective July 1, 2001, there shall be no deduction applied against the base funding
9 level for any pupil in average daily attendance who spends a portion of his or her
10 school day in a program at a state-operated career and technical education or
11 vocational facility.
12 (16) During a fiscal year, a school district may request that the Department of Education
13 recalculate its funds allocated under this section if the current year average daily
14 attendance for the twenty (20) day school month as defined in KRS 158.060(1) that
15 contains the most days within the calendar month of January exceeds the prior year
16 adjusted average daily attendance plus growth by at least one percent (1%). Any
17 adjustments in the allotments approved under this subsection shall be proportional
18 to the remaining days in the school year and subject to available funds under the
19 program to support education excellence in Kentucky.
20 (17) To calculate the state portion of the program to support education excellence in
21 Kentucky for a school district, the Department of Education shall subtract the local
22 effort required under KRS 157.390(5) from the calculated base funding under the
23 program to support education excellence in Kentucky, as required by this section.
24 The value of the real estate used in this calculation shall be the lesser of the current
25 year assessment or the prior year assessment increased by four percent (4%) plus
26 the value of current year new property. The calculation under this subsection shall
27 be subject to available funds.
