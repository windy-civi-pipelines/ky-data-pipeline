18 employer contributions of the Teachers' Retirement System pension
19 fund to fund existing statutory benefits as determined by the system's
20 consulting actuary in the annual actuarial valuation conducted
21 pursuant to KRS 161.400 and any funds requested to fund retiree
22 health benefits pursuant to KRS 161.550(2);
23 (b) In determining the distributable cost of the program to support education
24 excellence in Kentucky, the statewide guaranteed base funding level, as
25 defined in KRS 157.320, shall be computed by dividing the amount
26 appropriated for this purpose by the prior year's statewide average daily
27 attendance; and[.]

1 (c)[(b)] When determining the biennial appropriations for the program, the
2 average daily attendance for each fiscal year shall include an estimate of the
3 number of students graduating early under the provisions of KRS 158.142.
4 (2) Each district shall receive an amount equal to the base funding level for each pupil
5 in average daily attendance in the district in the previous year, except a district shall
6 receive an amount equal to one-half (1/2) of the state portion of the average
7 statewide per pupil guaranteed base funding level for each student who graduated
8 early under the provisions of KRS 158.142. Each district's base funding level shall
9 be adjusted by the following factors:
10 (a) The number of at-risk students in the district. At-risk students shall be
11 identified as those approved for the free lunch program under state and federal
12 guidelines. The number of at-risk students shall be multiplied by a factor to be
13 established by the General Assembly. Funds generated under this paragraph
14 may be used to pay for:
15 1. Alternative programs for students who are at risk of dropping out of
16 school before achieving a diploma; and
17 2. A hazardous duty pay supplement as determined by the local board of
18 education to the teachers who work in alternative programs with
19 students who are violent or assaultive;
20 (b) The number and types of exceptional children in the district as defined by
21 KRS 157.200. Specific weights for each category of exceptionality shall be
22 used in the calculation of the add-on factor for exceptional children; and
23 (c) Transportation costs. The per-pupil cost of transportation shall be calculated
24 as provided by KRS 157.370. Districts which contract to furnish
25 transportation to students attending nonpublic schools may adopt any payment
26 formula which ensures that no public school funds are used for the
27 transportation of nonpublic students.

1 (3) Beginning with the 2015-2016 school year and each year thereafter, the General
2 Assembly shall annually allocate funds equal to one-half (1/2) of the state portion
3 of the average statewide per pupil guaranteed base funding level for each student
4 who graduated early under the provisions of KRS 158.142 the previous school year
5 to the Kentucky Higher Education Assistance Authority for deposit in the early
6 graduation scholarship trust fund.
7 (4) The program to support education excellence in Kentucky shall be fully
8 implemented by the 1994-95 school year.
9 (5) (a) Except for those schools which have implemented school-based decision
10 making, the commissioner of education shall enforce maximum class sizes for
11 every academic course requirement in all grades except in vocal and
12 instrumental music, and physical education classes. Except as provided in
13 subsection (6) of this section, the maximum number of pupils enrolled in a
14 class shall be as follows:
15 1. Twenty-four (24) in primary grades (kindergarten through third grade);
16 2. Twenty-eight (28) in grade four (4);
17 3. Twenty-nine (29) in grades five (5) and six (6);
18 4. Thirty-one (31) in grades seven (7) to twelve (12).
19 (b) Except for those schools which have implemented school-based decision
20 making, class size loads for middle and secondary school classroom teachers
21 shall not exceed the equivalent of one hundred fifty (150) pupil hours per day.
22 (c) The commissioner of education, upon approval of the Kentucky Board of
23 Education, shall adopt administrative regulations for enforcing this provision.
24 These administrative regulations shall include procedures for a superintendent
25 to request an exemption from the Kentucky Board of Education when unusual
26 circumstances warrant an increased class size for an individual class. A
27 request for an exemption shall include specific reasons for the increased class
Page 7 of 12
XXXX 2/17/2025 9:09 PM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1647
1 size with a plan for reducing the class size prior to the beginning of the next
2 school year. A district shall not receive in any one (1) year exemptions for
3 more classes than enroll twenty percent (20%) of the pupils in the primary
4 grades and grades four (4) through eight (8).
5 (d) In all schools the commissioner of education shall enforce the special
6 education maximum class sizes set by administrative regulations adopted by
7 the Kentucky Board of Education. A superintendent may request an
8 exemption pursuant to paragraph (c) of this subsection. A local school council
9 may request a waiver pursuant to KRS 156.160(2). An exemption or waiver
10 shall not be granted if the increased class size will impede any exceptional
11 child from achieving his or her individual education program in the least
12 restrictive environment.
13 (6) In grades four (4) through six (6) with combined grades, the maximum class size
14 shall be the average daily attendance upon which funding is appropriated for the
15 lowest assigned grade in the class. There shall be no exceptions to the maximum
16 class size for combined classes. In combined classes other than the primary grades,
17 no ungraded students shall be placed in a combined class with graded students. In
18 addition, there shall be no more than two (2) consecutive grade levels combined in
19 any one (1) class in grades four (4) through six (6). However, this shall not apply to
20 schools which have implemented school-based decision making.
21 (7) If a local school district, through its admission and release committee, determines
22 that an appropriate program in the least restrictive environment for a particular child
23 with a disability includes either part-time or full-time enrollment with a private
24 school or agency within the state or a public or private agency in another state, the
25 school district shall count as average daily attendance in a public school the time
26 that the child is in attendance at the school or agency, contingent upon approval by
27 the commissioner of education.

1 (8) Pupils attending a center for child learning and study established under an
2 agreement pursuant to KRS 65.210 to 65.300 shall, for the purpose of calculating
3 average daily attendance, be considered as in attendance in the school district in
4 which the child legally resides and which is party to the agreement. For purposes of
5 subsection (1) of this section, teachers who are actually employees of the joint or
6 cooperative action shall be considered as employees of each school district which is
7 a party to the agreement.
8 (9) Program funding shall be increased when the average daily attendance in any
9 district for the first two (2) months of the current school year is greater than the
10 average daily attendance of the district for the first two (2) months of the previous
11 school year. The program funds allotted the district shall be increased by the
12 percent of increase. The average daily attendance in kindergarten is the
13 kindergarten full-time equivalent pupils in average daily attendance.
14 (10) If the average daily attendance for the current school year in any district decreases
15 by ten percent (10%) or more than the average daily attendance for the previous
16 school year, the average daily attendance for purposes of calculating program
17 funding for the next school year shall be increased by an amount equal to two-thirds
18 (2/3) of the decrease in average daily attendance. If the average daily attendance
19 remains the same or decreases in the succeeding school year, the average daily
20 attendance for purposes of calculating program funding for the following school
21 year shall be increased by an amount equal to one-third (1/3) of the decrease for the
22 first year of the decline.
23 (11) If the percentage of attendance of any school district shall have been reduced more
24 than two percent (2%) during the previous school year, the program funding
25 allotted the district for the current school year shall be increased by the difference in
26 the percentage of attendance for the two (2) years immediately prior to the current
27 school year less two percent (2%).

11 that the teacher is scheduled to attend an institution of higher education class
12 which could be credited toward meeting any certification requirement.
13 (b) Each teacher of agriculture employed shall submit an annual plan for summer
14 program to the local school superintendent for approval. The summer plan
15 shall include a list of tasks to be performed, purposes for each task, and time
16 to be spent on each task. Approval by the local school superintendent shall be
17 in compliance with the guidelines developed by the Department of Education.
18 The supervision and accountability of teachers of vocational agriculture's
19 summer programs shall be the responsibility of the local school
20 superintendent. The local school superintendent shall submit to the
21 commissioner of education a completed report of summer tasks for each
22 vocational agriculture teacher. Twenty percent (20%) of the approved
23 vocational agriculture programs shall be audited annually by the State
24 Department of Education to determine that the summer plan has been properly
25 executed.
26 (13) (a) In allotting program funds for home and hospital instruction, statewide

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1647
1 each child in average daily attendance in the prior school year who has been
2 properly identified according to Kentucky Board of Education administrative
3 regulations. Attendance shall be calculated pursuant to KRS 157.270 and shall
4 be reported monthly on forms provided by the Department of Education; and
5 (b) Pursuant to administrative regulations of the Kentucky Board of Education,
6 local school districts shall be reimbursed for home and hospital instruction for
7 pupils unable to attend regular school sessions because of short-term health

9 regulations to include such factors as a reasonable per hour, per child
10 allotment for teacher instructional time, with a maximum number of funded
11 hours per week, a reasonable allotment for teaching supplies and equipment,
12 and a reasonable allotment for travel expenses to and from instructional
13 assignments, but the formula shall not include an allotment for capital outlay.
14 Attendance shall be calculated pursuant to KRS 157.270 and shall be reported

22 school day in a program at a state-operated career and technical education or
23 vocational facility.
24 (16) During a fiscal year, a school district may request that the Department of Education
25 recalculate its funds allocated under this section if the current year average daily

1 adjusted average daily attendance plus growth by at least one percent (1%). Any
2 adjustments in the allotments approved under this subsection shall be proportional
3 to the remaining days in the school year and subject to available funds under the
4 program to support education excellence in Kentucky.
5 (17) To calculate the state portion of the program to support education excellence in
6 Kentucky for a school district, the Department of Education shall subtract the local
7 effort required under KRS 157.390(5) from the calculated base funding under the
8 program to support education excellence in Kentucky, as required by this section.
9 The value of the real estate used in this calculation shall be the lesser of the current
10 year assessment or the prior year assessment increased by four percent (4%) plus
11 the value of current year new property. The calculation under this subsection shall
12 be subject to available funds.
13 (18) Notwithstanding any other statute or budget of the Commonwealth language to the
14 contrary, time missed due to shortening days for emergencies may be made up by
15 lengthening school days in the school calendar without any loss of funds under the
16 program to support education excellence in Kentucky.

4 (2) Each district shall receive an amount equal to the base funding level for each pupil
5 in average daily attendance in the district in the previous year, except a district shall
6 receive an amount equal to one-half (1/2) of the state portion of the average
7 statewide per pupil guaranteed base funding level for each student who graduated
8 early under the provisions of KRS 158.142. Each district's base funding level shall
9 be adjusted by the following factors:
10 (a) The number of at-risk students in the district. At-risk students shall be
11 identified as those approved for the free lunch program under state and federal
12 guidelines. The number of at-risk students shall be multiplied by a factor to be
13 established by the General Assembly. Funds generated under this paragraph

22 used in the calculation of the add-on factor for exceptional children; and
23 (c) Transportation costs. The per-pupil cost of transportation shall be calculated
24 as provided by KRS 157.370. Districts which contract to furnish
25 transportation to students attending nonpublic schools may adopt any payment
26 formula which ensures that no public school funds are used for the
27 transportation of nonpublic students.

5 to the Kentucky Higher Education Assistance Authority for deposit in the early
6 graduation scholarship trust fund.
7 (4) The program to support education excellence in Kentucky shall be fully
8 implemented by the 1994-95 school year.

2 school year. A district shall not receive in any one (1) year exemptions for
3 more classes than enroll twenty percent (20%) of the pupils in the primary
4 grades and grades four (4) through eight (8).
5 (d) In all schools the commissioner of education shall enforce the special
6 education maximum class sizes set by administrative regulations adopted by

8 exemption pursuant to paragraph (c) of this subsection. A local school council
9 may request a waiver pursuant to KRS 156.160(2). An exemption or waiver
10 shall not be granted if the increased class size will impede any exceptional
11 child from achieving his or her individual education program in the least
12 restrictive environment.
13 (6) In grades four (4) through six (6) with combined grades, the maximum class size
14 shall be the average daily attendance upon which funding is appropriated for the
15 lowest assigned grade in the class. There shall be no exceptions to the maximum
16 class size for combined classes. In combined classes other than the primary grades,
17 no ungraded students shall be placed in a combined class with graded students. In

22 that an appropriate program in the least restrictive environment for a particular child
23 with a disability includes either part-time or full-time enrollment with a private
24 school or agency within the state or a public or private agency in another state, the
25 school district shall count as average daily attendance in a public school the time
26 that the child is in attendance at the school or agency, contingent upon approval by
27 the commissioner of education.

11 school year. The program funds allotted the district shall be increased by the
12 percent of increase. The average daily attendance in kindergarten is the
13 kindergarten full-time equivalent pupils in average daily attendance.
14 (10) If the average daily attendance for the current school year in any district decreases
15 by ten percent (10%) or more than the average daily attendance for the previous
16 school year, the average daily attendance for purposes of calculating program
17 funding for the next school year shall be increased by an amount equal to two-thirds
18 (2/3) of the decrease in average daily attendance. If the average daily attendance
19 remains the same or decreases in the succeeding school year, the average daily
20 attendance for purposes of calculating program funding for the following school
21 year shall be increased by an amount equal to one-third (1/3) of the decrease for the
22 first year of the decline.
23 (11) If the percentage of attendance of any school district shall have been reduced more
24 than two percent (2%) during the previous school year, the program funding
25 allotted the district for the current school year shall be increased by the difference in
26 the percentage of attendance for the two (2) years immediately prior to the current
27 school year less two percent (2%).

6 Kentucky for a school district, the Department of Education shall subtract the local
7 effort required under KRS 157.390(5) from the calculated base funding under the
8 program to support education excellence in Kentucky, as required by this section.
