1 person's actions in relation to medicinal cannabis created an unreasonable danger to
2 the safety of the minor child as established by clear and convincing evidence.
3 (3) (a) For the purposes of medical care, including organ transplants, a patient's
4 authorized use of medicinal cannabis is the equivalent of the authorized use of
5 any other medication used at the direction of a practitioner.
6 (b) A health facility as defined in KRS 216B.015 may develop policies to allow a
7 patient who is a registered qualified patient or visiting qualified patient to use
8 medicinal cannabis on the premises of the health facility.
9 (4) (a) A school shall not refuse to enroll, or otherwise penalize, a person solely for
10 his or her status as a cardholder, unless failing to do so would violate federal
11 law or regulations and cause the school to lose a monetary or licensing-related
12 benefit under federal law or regulations.
13 (b) A school shall not be penalized or denied any benefit under state law for
14 enrolling a cardholder.
15 (c) Each local board of education[, each board of directors of a public charter
16 school,] and the governing body of each certified nonpublic school shall[, no
17 later than December 1, 2024,] establish policies related to the use of medicinal
18 cannabis by a pupil who is a registered qualified patient on school property.
19 Policies enacted pursuant to this paragraph shall either prohibit the use of
20 medicinal cannabis on school property or permit the use of medicinal
21 cannabis on school property by a pupil who is a registered qualified patient as
22 deemed necessary by the pupil's parent or legal guardian. If a local board of
23 education[, the board of directors of a public charter school,] or the governing
24 body of a certified nonpublic school enacts a policy to permit the use of
25 medicinal cannabis by a pupil who is a registered qualified patient, that policy
26 shall:
27 1. Require medicinal cannabis be administered:
