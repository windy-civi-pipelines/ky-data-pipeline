5 (a) "Teacher" shall mean any person for whom certification is required as a basis
6 of employment in the common schools of the state;
7 (b) "Employee" shall mean any person, other than a teacher, employed in the
8 public schools, whether on a full or part-time basis;
9 (c) "Immediate family" shall mean the teacher's or employee's spouse, children
10 including stepchildren and foster children, grandchildren, daughters-in-law
11 and sons-in law, brothers and sisters, parents and spouse's parents, and
12 grandparents and spouse's grandparents, without reference to the location or

14 teacher's or employee's home;
15 (d) "Sick leave bank" shall mean an aggregation of sick leave days contributed by
16 teachers or employees for use by teachers or employees who have exhausted
17 all sick leave and other available paid leave days; and
18 (e) "Assault" shall mean an act that intentionally causes injury so significant that
19 the victim is determined to be, by certification of a physician or surgeon duly
20 qualified under KRS Chapter 342, incapable of performing the duties of his or
21 her job.
22 (2) Each district board of education shall allow to each teacher and full-time employee
23 in its common school system not less than ten (10) days of sick leave during each
24 school year, without deduction of salary. Sick leave shall be granted to a teacher or
25 employee if he or she presents a personal statement or a certificate of a physician

1 ill, or for the purpose of mourning a member of his or her immediate family. The
2 ten (10) days of sick leave granted in this subsection may be taken by a teacher or
3 employee on any ten (10) days of the school year and shall be granted in addition to
4 accumulated sick leave days that have been credited to the teacher or employee
5 under the provisions of subsection (4) of this section.
6 (3) A school district shall coordinate among the income and benefits from workers'
7 compensation, temporary disability retirement, and district payroll and benefits so
8 that there is no loss of income or benefits to a teacher or employee for work time
9 lost because of an assault while performing the teacher's or employee's assigned
10 duties for a period of up to one (1) year after the assault. In the event a teacher or
11 employee suffers an assault while performing his or her assigned duties that results
12 in injuries that qualify the teacher or employee for workers' compensation benefits,
13 the district shall provide leave to the teacher or employee for up to one (1) year
14 after the assault with no loss of income or benefits under the following conditions:
15 (a) The district shall pay the salary of the teacher or employee between the time

17 income benefits take effect, or the time the teacher or employee is certified to
18 return to work by a physician or surgeon duly qualified under KRS Chapter
19 342, whichever is sooner;
20 (b) The district shall pay, for up to one (1) year from the time of the assault, the

22 compensation income benefits received by the teacher or employee resulting
23 from the assault. Payments by the district shall include payments for
24 intermittent work time missed as a result of the assault during the one (1) year
25 period. If the teacher's or employee's workers' compensation income benefits
26 cease during the one (1) year period after the assault, the district shall also
27 cease to make payments under this paragraph;

8 (e) Payments to a teacher or employee under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this
9 subsection shall be coordinated with workers' compensation benefits under
10 KRS Chapter 342, disability retirement benefits for teachers under KRS
11 161.661 to 161.663, and disability retirement benefits for employees under
12 KRS 61.600 to 61.621 and 78.5522, 78.5524, 78.5526, 78.5528, and 78.5530

21 may allow school district employees and teachers to use up to three (3) days' sick
22 leave per school year for emergency leave pursuant to KRS 161.152(3). Any
23 accumulated sick leave days credited to an employee or a teacher shall remain so

7 with the concurrence of the local school board by paying to the district an amount
8 equal to the total of all costs associated with the used sick leave.
9 (7) A district board of education may adopt a plan for a sick leave bank. The plan may
10 include limitations upon the number of days a teacher or employee may annually
11 contribute to the bank and limitations upon the number of days a teacher or
12 employee may annually draw from the bank. Only those teachers or employees who
13 contribute to the bank may draw upon the bank. Days contributed will be deducted
14 from the days available to the contributing teacher or employee. The sick leave
15 bank shall be administered in accordance with a policy adopted by the board of
16 education.

21 fifteen (15) days' sick leave may request the board of education to transfer a
22 designated amount of sick leave to another teacher or employee who is
23 authorized to receive the sick leave donated. A teacher or employee may not
24 request an amount of sick leave be donated that reduces his or her sick leave
25 balance to less than fifteen (15) days.
26 (b) A teacher or employee may receive donations of sick leave if:

13 leave, personal leave, and any other leave granted by the school district;

3 Forces of the United States, including the commissioned corps of the Public Health
4 Service, subject to the provisions of the Uniformed Services Employment and
5 Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 and the administrative regulations promulgated

8 retirement system or where a member leaves covered employment without giving
9 advance written or verbal notice of performing duty in the uniformed services.
10 Service in the uniformed services also includes uniformed service that occurs after
11 employment in a position covered by the retirement system where the member has
12 given advance written or verbal notice of performing duty in the uniformed services
13 and the member returns directly from uniformed services to covered employment.
14 Military service may be credited only if discharge was honorable or was not
15 terminated upon the occurrence of any of the events listed in 38 U.S.C. sec. 4304.
16 Service shall be considered as Kentucky teaching service, except that service may
17 not be used for meeting the service requirements set forth in KRS 161.600(1)(a)[ or
18 (2)] or 161.661(1) unless the service occurred after the member gave written or
19 verbal notice of performing duty in the uniformed services and the member returned
20 directly from uniformed services to covered employment. A maximum of six (6)
21 years of military service may be credited, but in no case a greater number of years
22 than the actual years of contributing service in Kentucky.

24 qualifying for annuity benefit payments from another retirement system financed
25 wholly or in part by public funds.
26 (3) A member having twenty (20) years or more of active duty in the military service,
27 and who is qualified for regular federal retirement benefits based on this military

5 the United States prior to employment in a position covered by the retirement
6 system or where the member leaves covered employment without giving
7 advance written or verbal notice of performing duty in the uniformed services
8 shall pay to the retirement system the full actuarial cost of the service credit
9 purchased as provided under KRS 161.220(22). These contributions shall not
10 be picked up, as described in KRS 161.540(2). In purchasing retirement credit
11 for active duty in the armed services, the latest years of service shall be
12 considered first in allowing credit toward retirement. The board of trustees
13 shall adopt a table of actuarial factors to be used in calculating the amount of
14 contribution required for crediting this service.
15 (b) If military service occurred after the member gave written or verbal notice of
16 performing duty in the uniformed services and the member returns directly
17 from uniformed services to covered employment, the member shall contribute
18 the regular member contribution required by KRS 161.540. The member may
19 make the payment of delayed contributions in a lump sum payment or in
20 installments not to exceed five (5) years beginning with the member's date of

23 reemployment until paid[. Members participating in the supplemental benefit
24 component who make the regular member contribution required by this
25 paragraph, shall also receive the mandatory employer contributions in the
26 supplemental benefit component for the period of service purchased].

5 request, the estimated actuarial cost of the National Guard or military reserves
6 service purchase based upon the information available at the time of the request.
7 The member shall be entitled to enter into a contract with the system at the time of
8 the request to purchase the National Guard or military reserve service by paying to
9 the system the estimated actuarial cost, either by installments or in lump sum. The
10 member shall pay the full actuarial cost of this service in the military reserves or the
11 National Guard as provided in KRS 161.220(22). Service in the military reserves or
12 the National Guard shall be treated as service earned prior to participation in the
13 system and shall not be used for meeting the service requirements set forth in KRS
14 161.600(1)(a)[ or (2)] or 161.661(1). The payment shall not be picked up by the

18 dollars ($200) per month, payable for the life of the child or until the time as
19 the mental or physical condition creating the dependency no longer exists or

4 those benefits under this section shall immediately notify the Teachers' Retirement
5 System of this disqualification in writing and shall return all benefits paid after the

7 indebtedness of that person to the Teachers' Retirement System. Interest at the rate
8 of eight percent (8%) per annum shall be charged if the debt is not repaid within
9 sixty (60) days after the date of disqualification. Failure to repay this debt creates a
10 lien in favor of the Teachers' Retirement System upon all property of the person
11 who improperly receives benefits and does not repay those benefits; and
12 (11) Benefits under subsections (2) and (3) of this section shall apply to a child who is a

9 161.600(1)(a)[ or (2)] or 161.661(1). Payment for the service credit purchased may be
10 made in installments in lieu of a lump-sum payment. The payment shall not be picked up,
11 as described in KRS 161.540(2), and the entire payment shall be placed in the teachers'
12 savings fund.
13 Section 15. KRS 161.605 is amended to read as follows:
14 Any member retired by reason of service may return to work in a position covered by the
15 Kentucky Teachers' Retirement System and continue to receive his or her retirement
16 allowance under the following conditions:
17 (1) Any member who is retired with thirty (30) or more years of service may return to
18 work in a full-time or a part-time position, or in a position providing substitute
19 teaching service, covered by the Teachers' Retirement System and earn up to a
20 maximum of seventy-five percent (75%) of the member's last annual compensation
21 measured on a daily rate to be determined by the board of trustees. For purposes of
22 determining whether the salary of a member returning to work is seventy-five
23 percent (75%) or less of the member's last annual compensation, all remuneration
24 paid and benefits provided to the member, on an actual dollar or fair market value
25 basis as determined by the retirement system, excluding employer-provided medical
26 insurance required under subsection (5) of this section, shall be considered.
27 Members who were retired on or before June 30, 2002, shall be entitled to return to
Page 56 of 79
XXXX 1/7/2025 2:52 PM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1078
1 work under the provisions of this section as if they had retired with thirty (30) years
2 of service. Nonqualified service credit purchased under the provisions of KRS
3 161.5465 or elsewhere with any state-administered retirement system shall not be
4 used to meet the thirty (30) year requirement set forth in this subsection. Out-of
5 state teaching service provided in public schools for kindergarten through grade
6 twelve (12) may count toward the thirty (30) year requirement set forth in this
7 subsection even if it is not purchased as service credit, if the member obtains from
8 his or her out-of-state employer certification of this service on forms prescribed by
9 the retirement system;
10 (2) Any member who is retired with less than thirty (30) years of service after June 30,
11 2002, may return to work in a full-time or part-time position, or in a position
12 providing substitute teaching service, covered by the Teachers' Retirement System
13 and earn up to a maximum of sixty-five percent (65%) of the member's last annual
14 compensation measured on a daily rate to be determined by the board of trustees.
15 For purposes of determining whether the salary of a member returning to work is
16 sixty-five percent (65%) or less of the member's last annual compensation, all
17 remuneration paid and benefits provided to the member, on an actual dollar or fair
18 market value basis as determined by the retirement system, excluding employer-
19 provided medical insurance required under subsection (5) of this section, shall be
20 considered;
21 (3) Reemployment of a retired member under subsection (1) or (2) of this section in a
22 full-time teaching or nonteaching position in a local school district shall be
23 permitted only if the employer certifies to the Kentucky Teachers' Retirement
24 System that there are no other qualified applicants available to fill the teaching or
25 nonteaching position. The employer may use any source considered reliable,
26 including but not limited to data provided by the Education Professional Standards
27 Board and the Department of Education, to determine whether other qualified
Page 57 of 79
XXXX 1/7/2025 2:52 PM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1078
1 applicants are available to fill the teaching or nonteaching position. The Kentucky
2 Board of Education shall promulgate administrative regulations to establish
3 procedures to determine whether other qualified applicants are available to fill a
4 teaching or nonteaching position and, if not, for filling the position with a retired
5 member who will then be permitted to return to work in that position under
6 subsection (1) or (2) of this section. The administrative regulations shall ensure that
7 a retired member shall not be hired in a teaching or nonteaching position by a local
8 school district until the superintendent of the school district assures the Kentucky
9 Teachers' Retirement System that every reasonable effort has been made to recruit
10 other qualified applicants for the position on an annual basis;
11 (4) Under this section, an employer may employ full-time a number of retired members
12 not to exceed three percent (3%) of the membership actively employed full-time by
13 that employer. The board of trustees may reduce this three percent (3%) cap upon
14 recommendation of the retirement system's actuary if a reduction is necessary to
15 maintain the actuarial soundness of the retirement system. The board of trustees
16 may increase the three percent (3%) cap upon a determination that an increase is
17 warranted to help address a shortage in the number of available teachers and upon
18 the determination of the retirement system's actuary that the proposed cap increase
19 allows the actuarial soundness of the retirement system to be maintained. For
20 purposes of this subsection, "full-time" means the same as defined by KRS
21 161.220(21). A local school district may exceed the quota established by this
22 subsection by making an annual written request to the Kentucky Department of
23 Education which the department may approve on a year-by-year basis if the
24 statewide quota has not been met. A district's written request to exceed its quota
25 shall be submitted no sooner than two (2) weeks after the start of the school year;
26 (5) (a) Except as provided by subsection (10) of this section, a member returning to
27 work in a full-time or part-time position, or in a position providing substitute

1 teaching service, under subsection (1) or (2) of this section shall contribute to
2 an account with the retirement system that shall be administered
3 independently from and with no reciprocal impact with the member's original
4 retirement account, or any other account from which the member is eligible to
5 draw a retirement allowance.
6 (b) Except as provided by subsection (10) of this section, a member returning to
7 work under subsection (1) or (2) of this section shall make contributions to the
8 retirement system at the rate provided under KRS 161.540. The new account
9 shall independently meet all vesting requirements as well as all other
10 conditions set forth in KRS 161.600(1)[ or (2), as applicable,] before any
11 retirement allowance is payable from this account. The retirement allowance
12 accruing under this new account shall be calculated pursuant to KRS 161.620.
13 This new account shall not entitle the member to a duplication of the benefits
14 offered under KRS 161.620(7) or 161.675, nor shall this new account provide
15 the benefits offered by KRS 161.520, 161.525, 161.620(3), 161.655, 161.661,
16 or 161.663.
17 (c) A member returning to work under subsection (1) or (2) of this section shall
18 waive his or her medical insurance with the Teachers' Retirement System
19 during the period of reemployment and shall receive the medical insurance
20 coverage that is generally provided by the member's active employer to the
21 other members of the retirement system that the active employer employs. If
22 medical insurance coverage is not available from the employer, the Kentucky
23 Teachers' Retirement System may provide coverage for the member.
24 (d) A member returning to work under subsection (1) or (2) of this section shall
25 not be eligible to purchase service credit for any service provided after the
26 member's effective date of retirement but prior to the date that the member
27 returns to work. A member returning to work under subsection (1) or (2) of
Page 59 of 79
XXXX 1/7/2025 2:52 PM Jacketed

1 this section shall not be eligible to purchase service credit that the member
2 would have otherwise been eligible to purchase prior to the member's initial
3 retirement.
4 (e) A member who returns to work under subsection (1) or (2) of this section, or
5 in the event of the death of the member, the member's estate or applicably
6 designated beneficiary, shall be entitled, within ninety (90) days of the posting
7 of the annual report submitted by the employer, to a refund of contributions as
8 permitted and limited by KRS 161.470;
9 (6) The board of trustees may annually, on July 1, adjust the current daily rate of a
10 member's last annual compensation, for each full twelve (12) month period that has
11 elapsed subsequent to the member earning his or her last annual compensation, by
12 the percentage increase in the annual average of the consumer price index for all
13 urban consumers for the calendar year preceding the adjustment as published by the
14 Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, not to exceed five percent (5%) annually. Each
15 annual adjustment shall become part of the member's daily rate base. Failure to
16 comply with the salary limitations set forth in subsections (1) and (2) of this section
17 as may be adjusted by this subsection shall result in a reduction of the member's
18 retirement allowance or any other benefit to which the member would otherwise be
19 entitled on a dollar-for-dollar basis for each dollar that the member exceeds these
20 salary limitations, and the member shall be refunded his or her retirement
21 contributions made on the compensation that exceeds these salary limitations.
22 Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, a member retiring from
23 a local school district who returns to work for a local school district under
24 subsection (1) or (2) of this section shall be entitled, without any reduction to his or
25 her retirement allowance or any other retirement benefit, to earn a minimum
26 amount equal to one hundred seventy dollars ($170) per day;
27 (7) (a) A retired member returning to work under subsection (1) or (2) of this section
Page 60 of 79
XXXX 1/7/2025 2:52 PM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1078
1 shall have separated from service for a period of at least one (1) year if
2 returning to work for the same employer on a full-time basis, and at least three
3 (3) months if returning to work for a different employer on a full-time basis.
4 A retired member returning to work under subsection (1) or (2) of this section
5 on a part-time basis shall have separated from service for a period of at least
6 three (3) months before returning to work for any employer.
7 (b) As an alternative to the separation-from-service requirements in paragraph (a)
8 of this subsection, a retired member who is returning to work for the same
9 employer in a full-time position under subsections (1) and (2) of this section
10 may elect a separation-from-service of not less than two (2) months followed
11 by a forfeiture of the retired member's retirement allowance on a month-to-
12 month basis for each month that the member has separated from service for
13 less than twelve (12) full months. A retired member returning to work for the
14 same employer in a part-time position, or for a different employer in a full-
15 time position, may elect an alternative separation-from-service requirement of
16 at least two (2) months followed by a forfeiture of the member's retirement
17 allowance for one (1) month. During the period that the member forfeits his or
18 her retirement allowance and thereafter, member and employer contributions
19 shall be made to the retirement system as a result of employment in any
20 position subject to membership in the retirement system. The member shall
21 contribute to an account with the retirement system subject to the conditions
22 set forth in subsection (5) of this section.
23 (c) A retired member who is returning to work for an employer that has
24 employees who participate in the Teachers' Retirement System shall comply
25 with the separation-from-service requirements in this subsection before
26 performing any service for the employer, regardless of whether the retired
27 member is providing service in a position covered by the Teachers'

1 Retirement System.
2 (d) The starting date for any separation from service required under this
3 subsection shall be the effective date of the member's retirement.
4 (e) The separation-from-service requirements of this subsection are not met if
5 there is a prearranged agreement between the member and an employer that
6 has employees who participate in the Teachers' Retirement System prior to
7 retirement for the member to work for the employer after retirement.
8 (f) The Teachers' Retirement System may require the member and the employer
9 for which the member is returning to work to certify in writing on a form
10 prescribed by the Teachers' Retirement System that no prearranged agreement
11 was or will be entered into between the member and employer prior to
12 retirement for the member to work for the employer after retirement.
13 (g) Failure to comply with the separation-from-service requirements in this
14 subsection voids a member's retirement and the member shall be required to
15 return all the retirement benefits he or she received, with interest, for the
16 period of time that the member returned to work without a sufficient
17 separation from service;
18 (8) (a) Effective July 1, 2004, local school districts may employ retired members in
19 full-time or part-time teaching or administrative positions without limitation
20 on the compensation of the retired members that is otherwise required by
21 subsections (1) and (2) of this section. Under provisions of this subsection, a
22 local school district may only employ retired members to fill critical shortage
23 positions for which there are no other qualified applicants as determined by
24 the local superintendent. The number of retired members that a local school
25 district may employ under this subsection shall be no more than two (2)
26 members per local school district or one percent (1%) of the total active
27 members employed by the local school district on a full-time basis as defined

1 under KRS 161.220(21), whichever number is greater. Retired members
2 returning to work under this subsection shall be subject to the separation-
3 from-service requirements set forth in subsection (7) of this section. Retired
4 members returning to work under this subsection shall waive their medical
5 insurance coverage with the retirement system during their period of
6 reemployment and receive medical insurance coverage that is offered to other
7 full-time members employed by the local school district. Retired members
8 returning to work under this subsection shall contribute to an account subject
9 to the conditions set forth in subsection (5) of this section. Retired members
10 returning to work under this subsection shall make contributions to the
11 retirement system at the rate provided under KRS 161.540. The employer
12 shall make contributions at the rate provided under KRS 161.550. Local
13 school districts shall make annual payments to the retirement system on the
14 compensation paid to the reemployed retirees at the rates determined by the
15 retirement system's actuary that reflect any accrued liability resulting from the
16 reemployment of these members.
17 (b) The Department of Education may employ retired members in full-time or
18 part-time teaching or nonteaching positions without the limitations on
19 compensation otherwise required by subsections (1) and (2) of this section to
20 fill critical shortage areas in the schools it operates, including the Kentucky
21 School for the Blind, the Kentucky School for the Deaf, and the Kentucky
22 Virtual High School, and to serve on audit teams. The department shall be
23 subject to the same requirements as local school districts as provided in
24 paragraph (a) of this subsection, except the Teachers' Retirement System shall
25 determine the maximum number of employees that may be employed under
26 this paragraph;

2 a position substantially similar to the one from which they retired, or a position
3 described in KRS 161.046 or any position listed in KRS 161.220(4) which requires
4 membership in the retirement system. Positions which generally require
5 certification or graduation from a four (4) year college or university as a condition
6 of employment which are created, or changed to remove the position from coverage
7 under KRS 161.220(4) are also subject to the return to work limitations set forth in
8 this section. The board of trustees shall determine whether employment in a
9 nonteaching position is subject to this subsection;
10 (10) [(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, individuals who become
11 members on or after January 1, 2022, who subsequently retire and begin
12 drawing a monthly lifetime retirement allowance from the Teachers'
13 Retirement System, who following retirement are reemployed with an
14 employer participating in the Teachers' Retirement System, shall not be
15 eligible to contribute to or earn benefits in a second retirement account in the

23 position, shall waive his or her medical insurance coverage with the Teachers'
24 Retirement System during the period of reemployment, and shall receive the
25 medical insurance coverage that is generally offered by the member's active
26 employer to the other members of the retirement system employed by the

2 for life insurance benefits as provided in KRS 161.655. Service subsequent to
3 retirement shall not be used to improve an annuity, except as provided in
4 paragraphs (b) and (c) of this subsection;
5 (b) Any member who waives regular annuity benefits and returns to teaching or
6 covered employment shall be entitled to make contributions on the salaries
7 received for this service and have his or her retirement annuity recalculated as
8 provided in the regular retirement formula in KRS 161.620(1), less any
9 applicable actuarial discount applied to the original retirement allowance due
10 to the election of a joint and last survivor option. Retirement option and
11 beneficiary designation on original retirement shall not be altered by
12 postretirement employment, and dependents and spouses of the members shall
13 not become eligible for benefits under KRS 161.520, 161.525, or 161.661
14 because of postretirement employment;
15 (c) When a member returns to full-time teaching or covered employment as

19 improve an annuity. The member shall be returned to the annuity rolls on July
20 1 following completion of the contract year or on the first day of the month
21 following the month of termination of service if full-time employment
22 exceeds one (1) consecutive contract year. A member shall not be returned to
23 the annuity rolls until after he or she has filed a retirement application in
24 compliance with KRS 161.600(5)[(6)]. Any discounts applied at the time of
25 the original retirement due to service or age may be reduced or eliminated due
26 to additional employment if full-time employment is for one (1) consecutive
27 contract year or longer; and

1 (d) A member retired by reason of service who has been employed the equivalent
2 of twenty-five (25) days or more during a school year under KRS 161.605
3 may waive the member's retirement annuity and return to regular employment
4 covered by the Teachers' Retirement System during that school year a
5 maximum of one (1) time during any five (5) year period, beginning with that
6 school year;
7 (12) Retired members may be employed in a part-time teaching capacity by an agency
8 described in KRS 161.220(4)(b) or (n), not to exceed the equivalent of twelve (12)
9 teaching hours in any one (1) fiscal year. Retired members may be employed for a
10 period not to exceed the equivalent of one hundred (100) days in any one (1) fiscal
11 year in a part-time administrative or nonteaching capacity by an agency described
12 in KRS 161.220(4)(b) or (n) in a position that would otherwise be covered by the
13 retirement system. Except as otherwise provided by this subsection, the return to
14 work provisions set forth in subsections (1) to (8) of this section shall not apply to
15 retired members who return to work solely for an agency described in KRS
16 161.220(4)(b) or (n). Calculation of the number of days and teaching hours for part-
17 time teaching, substitute teaching, or part-time employment in a nonteaching
18 capacity under this section shall not exceed the ratio between a school year and the
19 actual months of retirement for the member during that school year. The board of
20 trustees by administrative regulation may establish fractional equivalents of a day
21 of teaching service. Any member who exceeds the twelve (12) hour or one hundred
22 (100) day limitations of this subsection shall be subject to having his or her
23 retirement voided and be required to return all retirement allowances and other
24 benefits paid to the member or on the member's behalf since the effective date of

7 in a nonteaching capacity as provided in subsection (12) of this section, the
8 employer shall contribute annually to the retirement system on the compensation
9 paid to the retired member at rates determined by the retirement system actuary that
10 reflect accrued liability for retired members who return to work under subsection
11 (12) of this section; and
12 (14) For retired members who return to work during any one (1) fiscal year in both a
13 position described in KRS 161.220(4)(b) or (n) and in a position described under
14 another provision under KRS 161.220(4), and for retired members who return to
15 work in a position described under KRS 161.220(4)(b) or (n) in both a teaching and
16 an administrative or nonteaching capacity, the board of trustees shall adopt a
17 methodology for a pro rata apportionment of days and hours that the retired

3 (1) Members providing part-time and substitute services shall accrue service credit as
4 provided under KRS 161.500 and be entitled to a retirement allowance upon
5 meeting the service retirement conditions of KRS 161.600. The board of trustees
6 shall adopt a methodology for accrediting service credit to these members on a pro
7 rata basis. The methodology adopted by the board of trustees may be amended as
8 necessary to ensure its actuarial soundness. The retirement allowance for members
9 providing part-time and substitute services shall be calculated pursuant to KRS
10 161.620[ and 161.635 or 161.636, as applicable], except that the provisions of KRS
11 161.620(3) shall not apply. Members providing part-time and substitute services

20 of contributions as permitted and limited by KRS 161.470;
21 (2) (a) 1. The board of trustees shall adopt eligibility conditions under which
22 members providing part-time and substitute services may participate in

24 161.663.

2 substitute services shall be applied to reduce, on a dollar-for-dollar
3 basis, the minimum monthly disability retirement allowance of five
4 hundred dollars ($500) provided for under KRS 161.661(6).
5 3. Effective July 1, 2021, members providing part-time or substitute
6 services shall not be eligible to apply for a disability retirement
7 allowance if they are eligible for a service retirement allowance that is
8 not subject to an actuarial reduction required under KRS 161.600(1)(b)

10 (b) The board of trustees may permit members providing part-time or substitute
11 services to participate in other benefits offered by the retirement system by
12 promulgating administrative regulations that establish eligibility conditions
13 for participation in these benefits. All eligibility conditions adopted by the
14 board of trustees pursuant to this subsection may be amended as necessary to
15 ensure their actuarial soundness;
16 (3) In addition to the pro rata methodology adopted by the board of trustees under
17 subsection (1) of this section, members providing part-time and substitute services
18 shall be subject to all limitations and conditions regarding the accrual, retention,
19 accreditation, and use of service credit that apply to members providing full-time
20 services. In addition to the eligibility conditions set forth by the board of trustees
21 under subsection (2) of this section, members providing part-time and substitute
22 services shall be subject to all limitations and conditions regarding both the
23 eligibility to participate and the extent of participation in any benefit offered under
24 KRS 161.220 to 161.716 that apply to members providing full-time services;

2 any one (1) fiscal year shall not be considered members of the Teachers' Retirement
3 System during that period in which they are serving as substitute teachers for five
4 (5) days or less;
5 (5) The board of trustees may adopt a pro rata methodology to determine the annual
6 compensation of members providing part-time and substitute services in order to
7 determine benefits provided under KRS 161.661 and 161.663. Members providing
8 part-time and substitute services who had retirement contributions posted to their
9 accounts during the previous fiscal year and who have not had those contributions
10 refunded to them are eligible to vote for the board of trustees;
11 (6) The board of trustees of the Teachers' Retirement System shall be responsible for
12 final determination of membership eligibility and may direct employers to take
13 whatever action that may be necessary to correct any error relating to membership;
14 and
15 (7) The provisions of this section are not subject to KRS 161.714.
16 Section 17. KRS 161.630 is amended to read as follows:
17 (1) (a) A member, upon retirement, shall receive a retirement allowance in the form
18 of a life annuity, with refundable balance, as provided in KRS 161.620, unless
19 an election is made before the effective date of retirement to receive
20 actuarially equivalent benefits under options which the board of trustees
21 approves.
22 (b) [An individual who is participating in the supplemental benefit component as
23 provided by KRS 161.635 or 161.636 may, before the effective date of
24 retirement, elect to receive his or her accumulated account balance accrued in
25 the supplemental benefit component annuitized into a monthly payment under
26 one (1) of the actuarial equivalent payment options approved by the board of
27 trustees.

1 (c) ]No option shall provide for a benefit with an actuarial value at the age of
2 retirement greater than that provided in KRS 161.620[, 161.635(5)(a), or
3 161.636(5)(a), as applicable]. This section does not apply to disability
4 allowances as provided in KRS 161.661(1).
5 (2) The retirement option chosen by a retiree at the time of service retirement shall
6 remain in force unless the retiree elects to make a change under the following
7 conditions:
8 (a) A divorce, annulment, or marriage dissolution following retirement shall, at
9 the election of the retiree, cancel any optional plan selected at retirement that
10 provides indefinitely continuing benefits to a spousal beneficiary and return
11 the retiree to a single lifetime benefit equivalent as determined by the board;
12 or
13 (b) Following marriage or remarriage, or the death of the designated beneficiary,
14 a retiree may elect a new optional plan of payment based on the actuarial
15 equivalent of a single lifetime benefit at the time of the election, as
16 determined by the board. The plan shall become effective the first of the
17 month following receipt of an application on a form approved by the board.
18 (3) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a beneficiary designation shall not be
19 changed after the effective date of retirement except for retirees who elect the life
20 annuity with refundable balance or the predetermined years certain and life
21 thereafter option. A member may remove a beneficiary at any time, but shall not
22 designate a substitute beneficiary. If a member elects to remove a beneficiary, the
23 member's retirement allowance shall not change regardless of the retirement option
24 selected by the member, even if the removed beneficiary predeceases the member.
25 (4) A member who experiences a qualifying event under subsection (2) of this section
26 and who elects a new optional plan of payment shall make that election within sixty
27 (60) days of the qualifying event.

1 Section 18. KRS 161.661 is amended to read as follows:
2 (1) (a) Any member who is accredited by the Teachers' Retirement System for five
3 (5) or more years of service in Kentucky after July 1, 1941, may retire for
4 disability and be granted a disability allowance if found to be eligible as
5 provided in this section. Application for disability benefits shall be made
6 within one (1) year of the last contributing service in Kentucky, and the
7 disability must have occurred during the most recent period of employment in
8 a position covered by the Teachers' Retirement System and subsequent to the
9 accreditation by the Teachers' Retirement System of five (5) years of
10 retirement system service credit in Kentucky. A disability occurring during
11 the regular vacation immediately following the last period of active service in
12 Kentucky or during an official leave for which the member is entitled to make
13 regular contributions to the retirement system, shall be considered as having
14 occurred during a period of active service.
15 (b) The annual disability allowance shall be equal to sixty percent (60%) of the
16 member's final average salary.
17 (c) The following individuals shall not be eligible for disability benefits under
18 this section:
19 1. Members with twenty-seven (27) or more years of service credit; and
20 2. Individuals who become members on or after July 1, 2021, who are
21 eligible for an unreduced benefit under KRS 161.600(1)(b)2. or (d).
22 (2) The provisions of KRS 161.520, 161.525, and subsections (3), (4), and (5) of this
23 section shall not apply to disability retirees whose benefits were calculated on the
24 service retirement formula nor to survivors of these members.
25 (3) Members shall earn one (1) year of entitlement to disability retirement, at sixty
26 percent (60%) of the member's final average salary, for each four (4) years of
27 service in a covered position, but any member meeting the service requirement for
Page 72 of 79
XXXX 1/7/2025 2:52 PM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1078
1 disability retirement shall be credited with no less than five (5) years of eligibility.
2 (4) A member retired by reason of disability shall continue to earn service credit at the
3 rate of one (1) year for each year retired for disability. This service shall be credited
4 to the member's account at the expiration of entitlement as defined in subsection (3)
5 of this section, or when the member's eligibility for disability benefits is terminated
6 upon recommendation of a medical review committee, and this service shall be
7 used in calculating benefits as provided in subsection (5) of this section, but under
8 no circumstances shall this service be used to provide the member with more than
9 twenty-seven (27) years of total service credit. The service credit shall be valued at
10 the same level as service earned by active members as provided under KRS 161.600
11 or 161.620.
12 (5) Any member retired by reason of disability and remaining disabled at the expiration
13 of the entitlement period shall have his or her disability benefits recalculated using
14 the service retirement formula with service credit earned as set out in subsection (4)
15 of this section. The retirement allowance shall be calculated as set forth in KRS
16 161.620, except that those persons less than sixty (60) years of age shall be
17 considered as sixty (60) years of age. Members having their disability benefits
18 recalculated under this subsection shall not be entitled to a benefit based upon an
19 average of their three (3) highest salaries as set forth in KRS 161.220(9), unless
20 approved otherwise by the board of trustees.
21 (6) Members who have their disability retirement allowance recalculated at the
22 expiration of the entitlement period shall continue to have coverage under the post-
23 retirement medical insurance program. Restrictions on employment shall remain in
24 effect until the member attains age seventy (70) or until the member's eligibility is
25 discontinued. KRS 161.520 and 161.525 shall not apply to survivors of disability
26 retirees whose retirement allowances have been recalculated at the expiration of the
27 entitlement period. Members who have their disability retirement allowance
Page 73 of 79
XXXX 1/7/2025 2:52 PM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1078
1 recalculated at the expiration of their entitlement period shall be entitled to a
2 minimum monthly allowance of five hundred dollars ($500) as the basic straight
3 life annuity. The minimum allowance shall be effective July 1, 1992, and shall
4 apply to those members who have had their allowance recalculated prior to that date
5 and to disability retirees who will have their benefit allowance recalculated on or
6 after that date. For individuals who become members on or after July 1, 2021,
7 disability retirement payments and any other recurring payments payable by any
8 other state-administered retirement system shall be applied to reduce, on a dollar-
9 for-dollar basis, the minimum monthly disability retirement allowance payable
10 under this subsection.
11 (7) Effective July 1, 1992, members retired for disability prior to July 1, 1964, shall be
12 entitled to a minimum monthly allowance of five hundred dollars ($500) as their
13 basic straight life annuity and their surviving spouse shall be eligible for survivor
14 benefits as provided in KRS 161.520(1)(a) and (b).
15 (8) Any member retired by reason of disability may voluntarily waive disability
16 benefits and return to teaching or any member, who is age sixty (60) years or older,
17 may elect to waive disability benefits and retire for service on the basis of service
18 credited to the member on the effective date of the disability retirement.
19 (9) In order to qualify for retirement by reason of disability a member must suffer from
20 a physical or mental condition presumed to be permanent in duration and of a
21 nature as to render the member incapable of being gainfully employed in a covered
22 position. The incapability must be revealed by a competent examination by a
23 licensed physician or physicians and must be approved by a majority of a medical
24 review committee.
25 (10) A member retired by reason of disability shall be required to undergo periodic
26 examinations at the discretion of the board of trustees to determine whether the
27 disability allowance shall be continued. When examination and recommendation of
Page 74 of 79
XXXX 1/7/2025 2:52 PM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1078
1 a medical review committee indicate the disability no longer exists, the allowance
2 shall be discontinued.
3 (11) Eligibility for payment shall begin on the first day of the month following receipt of
4 the application in the Teachers' Retirement System office, or the first of the month
5 next following the last payment of salary or sick leave benefits by the employer,
6 whichever is the later date.
7 (12) No person who receives a disability allowance may be employed in a position that
8 entails duties or qualification requirements similar to positions subject to
9 participation in the retirement system either within or without the State of
10 Kentucky. So doing shall constitute a misdemeanor and shall result in loss of the
11 allowance from the first date of this service. For purposes of this subsection and
12 subsection (13) of this section, "employment" and "occupation," and derivatives
13 thereof, mean any activity engaged in by the member receiving disability allowance
14 from which income is earned. A member who applies for and is approved for
15 disability retirement on or after July 1, 2002, and whose annual disability benefit is
16 less than forty thousand dollars ($40,000) may earn income in any occupation other
17 than covered employment only to the extent that the annual income from the other
18 employment when added to the annual disability benefit does not exceed forty
19 thousand dollars ($40,000). For any member who exceeds this limit as a result of
20 income from other employment, the Kentucky Teachers' Retirement System shall
21 reduce the member's disability benefit on a dollar-for-dollar basis for each dollar
22 that the member's combined annual disability benefit and annual income from other
23 employment exceeds forty thousand dollars ($40,000). The board of trustees may
24 annually increase the forty thousand dollar ($40,000) limit by the percentage
25 increase in the annual average of the consumer price index for all urban consumers
26 for the most recent calendar year as published by the Federal Bureau of Labor
27 Statistics, not to exceed five percent (5%). The retirement system may require
Page 75 of 79
XXXX 1/7/2025 2:52 PM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1078
1 income verification from the member, including but not limited to copies of tax
2 returns and federal forms W-2 and W-4P.
3 (13) All members who applied for disability retirement before July 1, 2002, and were
4 approved as a result of that application shall be subject to the income limitations as
5 they existed on June 30, 2002, until July 1, 2006. Effective July 1, 2006, the
6 twenty-seven thousand dollar ($27,000) limitation shall be increased to forty
7 thousand dollars ($40,000) and may be adjusted by the board of trustees by the
8 consumer price index in the manner described in subsection (12) of this section.
9 The recipient of a disability allowance who engages in any gainful occupation other
10 than covered employment must make a report of the duties involved, compensation
11 received, and any other pertinent information required by the board of trustees. The
12 retirement system may require income verification from the member, including but
13 not limited to copies of tax returns and federal forms W-2 and W-4P.
14 (14) The board of trustees shall designate medical review committees, each consisting of
15 three (3) licensed physicians. A medical review committee shall pass upon all
16 applications for disability retirement and upon all applicant statements, medical
17 certifications, and examinations submitted in connection with disability
18 applications. The disposition of each case shall be recommended by a medical
19 review committee in writing to the retirement system. Members of a medical review
20 committee shall follow administrative regulations regarding procedures as the board
21 of trustees may enact and shall be paid reasonable fees and expenses as authorized
22 by the board of trustees in compliance with the provisions of KRS 161.330 and
23 161.340. The retirement system may secure additional medical examinations and
24 information as it deems necessary. A member may appeal any final agency decision
25 denying his or her disability retirement application pursuant to the provisions of
26 KRS 161.250(2).
27 (15) A disability may be presumed to be permanent if the condition creating the
Page 76 of 79
XXXX 1/7/2025 2:52 PM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1078
1 disability may be reasonably expected to continue for one (1) year or more from the
2 date of application for disability benefits.
3 (16) Any member who has voluntarily waived disability benefits or whose disability
4 benefits have been discontinued on recommendation of a medical review
5 committee, may apply for reinstatement of disability benefits. The application for
6 reinstatement must be made to the retirement system within twelve (12) months of
7 the date disability benefits terminated. If the termination of benefits were voluntary,
8 the reinstatement may be made without medical examination if application is made
9 within three (3) months of the termination date. Other applications for reinstatement
10 will be processed in the same manner as new applications for benefits.
11 (17) No person who is receiving disability benefits under this section may be employed
12 in a position which qualifies the person for membership in a retirement system
13 financed wholly or in part with public funds. Employment in a position prohibited
14 by this subsection shall result in disqualification for those disability benefits from
15 the date of employment in the prohibited position.
16 (18) Any person who is receiving benefits and becomes disqualified from receiving
17 those benefits under this section, or becomes disqualified from receiving a portion
18 of those benefits due to income from other than covered employment, shall
19 immediately notify the Teachers' Retirement System of this disqualification in
20 writing and shall return all benefits paid after the date of disqualification. Failure to
21 comply with these provisions shall create an indebtedness of that person to the
22 Teachers' Retirement System. Interest at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum
23 shall be charged if the debt is not repaid within sixty (60) days after the date of
24 disqualification. Failure to repay this debt creates a lien in favor of the Teachers'
25 Retirement System upon all property of the person who improperly receives
26 benefits and does not repay those benefits. The Teachers' Retirement System may,
27 in order to collect an outstanding debt, reduce or terminate any benefit that a

1 member is otherwise entitled to receive.
2 [(19) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section to the contrary, individuals who
3 become members on or after January 1, 2022, shall be eligible for an actuarially
4 determined disability benefit as prescribed by the board of trustees via
5 administrative regulations promulgated by the board. The board of trustees shall
6 arrange by appropriate contract or on a self-insured basis a disability plan to
7 provide the disability benefits and may adjust the benefits in accordance with KRS
8 161.633(3) or 161.634(3).]

12 level and contain costs -- Construction.
13 161.634 Foundational component for persons who became university members on or

24 Section 20. Individuals who became members of the Teachers' Retirement
25 System on or after January 1, 2022, but prior to the effective date of this Act, who would
26 have otherwise been eligible for the benefits and rights provided by 2021 Ky. Acts ch.

1 AN ACT relating to the Teachers' Retirement System and declaring an emergency.
2 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
3 Section 1. KRS 161.155 is amended to read as follows:
4 (1) As used in this section:
5 (a) "Teacher" shall mean any person for whom certification is required as a basis
6 of employment in the common schools of the state;
7 (b) "Employee" shall mean any person, other than a teacher, employed in the
8 public schools, whether on a full or part-time basis;
9 (c) "Immediate family" shall mean the teacher's or employee's spouse, children
10 including stepchildren and foster children, grandchildren, daughters-in-law
11 and sons-in law, brothers and sisters, parents and spouse's parents, and
12 grandparents and spouse's grandparents, without reference to the location or
13 residence of said relative, and any other blood relative who resides in the
14 teacher's or employee's home;
15 (d) "Sick leave bank" shall mean an aggregation of sick leave days contributed by
16 teachers or employees for use by teachers or employees who have exhausted
17 all sick leave and other available paid leave days; and
18 (e) "Assault" shall mean an act that intentionally causes injury so significant that
19 the victim is determined to be, by certification of a physician or surgeon duly
20 qualified under KRS Chapter 342, incapable of performing the duties of his or
21 her job.
22 (2) Each district board of education shall allow to each teacher and full-time employee
23 in its common school system not less than ten (10) days of sick leave during each
24 school year, without deduction of salary. Sick leave shall be granted to a teacher or
25 employee if he or she presents a personal statement or a certificate of a physician
26 stating that the teacher or employee was ill, that the teacher or employee was absent
27 for the purpose of attending to a member of his or her immediate family who was

1 ill, or for the purpose of mourning a member of his or her immediate family. The
2 ten (10) days of sick leave granted in this subsection may be taken by a teacher or
3 employee on any ten (10) days of the school year and shall be granted in addition to
4 accumulated sick leave days that have been credited to the teacher or employee
5 under the provisions of subsection (4) of this section.
6 (3) A school district shall coordinate among the income and benefits from workers'
7 compensation, temporary disability retirement, and district payroll and benefits so
8 that there is no loss of income or benefits to a teacher or employee for work time
9 lost because of an assault while performing the teacher's or employee's assigned
10 duties for a period of up to one (1) year after the assault. In the event a teacher or
11 employee suffers an assault while performing his or her assigned duties that results
12 in injuries that qualify the teacher or employee for workers' compensation benefits,
13 the district shall provide leave to the teacher or employee for up to one (1) year
14 after the assault with no loss of income or benefits under the following conditions:
15 (a) The district shall pay the salary of the teacher or employee between the time

2 service credit for active service rendered in the uniformed services of the Armed
3 Forces of the United States, including the commissioned corps of the Public Health
4 Service, subject to the provisions of the Uniformed Services Employment and
5 Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 and the administrative regulations promulgated
6 by the board of trustees. Military service includes service in the uniformed services
7 that occurs before the employment of a member in a position covered by the
8 retirement system or where a member leaves covered employment without giving
9 advance written or verbal notice of performing duty in the uniformed services.
10 Service in the uniformed services also includes uniformed service that occurs after
11 employment in a position covered by the retirement system where the member has
12 given advance written or verbal notice of performing duty in the uniformed services
13 and the member returns directly from uniformed services to covered employment.
14 Military service may be credited only if discharge was honorable or was not
15 terminated upon the occurrence of any of the events listed in 38 U.S.C. sec. 4304.
16 Service shall be considered as Kentucky teaching service, except that service may
17 not be used for meeting the service requirements set forth in KRS 161.600(1)(a)[ or
18 (2)] or 161.661(1) unless the service occurred after the member gave written or
19 verbal notice of performing duty in the uniformed services and the member returned
20 directly from uniformed services to covered employment. A maximum of six (6)
21 years of military service may be credited, but in no case a greater number of years
22 than the actual years of contributing service in Kentucky.
23 (2) No credit shall be granted for military service which has been or will be used in
24 qualifying for annuity benefit payments from another retirement system financed
25 wholly or in part by public funds.
26 (3) A member having twenty (20) years or more of active duty in the military service,

4 (4) (a) A member receiving retirement credit for active duty in the armed services of
5 the United States prior to employment in a position covered by the retirement
6 system or where the member leaves covered employment without giving
7 advance written or verbal notice of performing duty in the uniformed services
8 shall pay to the retirement system the full actuarial cost of the service credit
9 purchased as provided under KRS 161.220(22). These contributions shall not
10 be picked up, as described in KRS 161.540(2). In purchasing retirement credit
11 for active duty in the armed services, the latest years of service shall be
12 considered first in allowing credit toward retirement. The board of trustees
13 shall adopt a table of actuarial factors to be used in calculating the amount of
14 contribution required for crediting this service.
15 (b) If military service occurred after the member gave written or verbal notice of
16 performing duty in the uniformed services and the member returns directly
17 from uniformed services to covered employment, the member shall contribute
18 the regular member contribution required by KRS 161.540. The member may
19 make the payment of delayed contributions in a lump sum payment or in
20 installments not to exceed five (5) years beginning with the member's date of

23 reemployment until paid[. Members participating in the supplemental benefit
24 component who make the regular member contribution required by this
25 paragraph, shall also receive the mandatory employer contributions in the
26 supplemental benefit component for the period of service purchased].

3 of service in the reserves or the National Guard. Notwithstanding any other statute,
4 regulation, or policy to the contrary, the system shall provide a member, upon
5 request, the estimated actuarial cost of the National Guard or military reserves
6 service purchase based upon the information available at the time of the request.
7 The member shall be entitled to enter into a contract with the system at the time of
8 the request to purchase the National Guard or military reserve service by paying to
9 the system the estimated actuarial cost, either by installments or in lump sum. The
10 member shall pay the full actuarial cost of this service in the military reserves or the
11 National Guard as provided in KRS 161.220(22). Service in the military reserves or
12 the National Guard shall be treated as service earned prior to participation in the
13 system and shall not be used for meeting the service requirements set forth in KRS
14 161.600(1)(a)[ or (2)] or 161.661(1). The payment shall not be picked up by the

2 (c) If the deceased member has a minimum of ten (10) years of service credit
3 with the Teachers' Retirement System, the surviving widow or widower may
4 apply for an annuity actuarially equivalent to the annuity that would have

8 applicable]. In exercising this right, the surviving widow or widower shall be
9 entitled to receive an annuity for life. This subsection applies to surviving

18 dollars ($200) per month, payable for the life of the child or until the time as
19 the mental or physical condition creating the dependency no longer exists or

4 those benefits under this section shall immediately notify the Teachers' Retirement
5 System of this disqualification in writing and shall return all benefits paid after the

7 indebtedness of that person to the Teachers' Retirement System. Interest at the rate
8 of eight percent (8%) per annum shall be charged if the debt is not repaid within
9 sixty (60) days after the date of disqualification. Failure to repay this debt creates a
10 lien in favor of the Teachers' Retirement System upon all property of the person
11 who improperly receives benefits and does not repay those benefits; and
12 (11) Benefits under subsections (2) and (3) of this section shall apply to a child who is a

9 the retirement system;
10 (2) Any member who is retired with less than thirty (30) years of service after June 30,

1 applicants are available to fill the teaching or nonteaching position. The Kentucky
2 Board of Education shall promulgate administrative regulations to establish
3 procedures to determine whether other qualified applicants are available to fill a
4 teaching or nonteaching position and, if not, for filling the position with a retired
5 member who will then be permitted to return to work in that position under
6 subsection (1) or (2) of this section. The administrative regulations shall ensure that
7 a retired member shall not be hired in a teaching or nonteaching position by a local
8 school district until the superintendent of the school district assures the Kentucky
9 Teachers' Retirement System that every reasonable effort has been made to recruit
10 other qualified applicants for the position on an annual basis;
11 (4) Under this section, an employer may employ full-time a number of retired members
12 not to exceed three percent (3%) of the membership actively employed full-time by
13 that employer. The board of trustees may reduce this three percent (3%) cap upon
14 recommendation of the retirement system's actuary if a reduction is necessary to
15 maintain the actuarial soundness of the retirement system. The board of trustees
16 may increase the three percent (3%) cap upon a determination that an increase is
17 warranted to help address a shortage in the number of available teachers and upon
18 the determination of the retirement system's actuary that the proposed cap increase
19 allows the actuarial soundness of the retirement system to be maintained. For
20 purposes of this subsection, "full-time" means the same as defined by KRS
21 161.220(21). A local school district may exceed the quota established by this
22 subsection by making an annual written request to the Kentucky Department of
23 Education which the department may approve on a year-by-year basis if the
24 statewide quota has not been met. A district's written request to exceed its quota
25 shall be submitted no sooner than two (2) weeks after the start of the school year;
26 (5) (a) Except as provided by subsection (10) of this section, a member returning to
27 work in a full-time or part-time position, or in a position providing substitute

1 teaching service, under subsection (1) or (2) of this section shall contribute to
2 an account with the retirement system that shall be administered
3 independently from and with no reciprocal impact with the member's original
4 retirement account, or any other account from which the member is eligible to
5 draw a retirement allowance.
6 (b) Except as provided by subsection (10) of this section, a member returning to
7 work under subsection (1) or (2) of this section shall make contributions to the
8 retirement system at the rate provided under KRS 161.540. The new account
9 shall independently meet all vesting requirements as well as all other
10 conditions set forth in KRS 161.600(1)[ or (2), as applicable,] before any
11 retirement allowance is payable from this account. The retirement allowance
12 accruing under this new account shall be calculated pursuant to KRS 161.620.
13 This new account shall not entitle the member to a duplication of the benefits
14 offered under KRS 161.620(7) or 161.675, nor shall this new account provide
15 the benefits offered by KRS 161.520, 161.525, 161.620(3), 161.655, 161.661,
16 or 161.663.
17 (c) A member returning to work under subsection (1) or (2) of this section shall
18 waive his or her medical insurance with the Teachers' Retirement System
19 during the period of reemployment and shall receive the medical insurance
20 coverage that is generally provided by the member's active employer to the
21 other members of the retirement system that the active employer employs. If
22 medical insurance coverage is not available from the employer, the Kentucky
23 Teachers' Retirement System may provide coverage for the member.
24 (d) A member returning to work under subsection (1) or (2) of this section shall
25 not be eligible to purchase service credit for any service provided after the
26 member's effective date of retirement but prior to the date that the member
27 returns to work. A member returning to work under subsection (1) or (2) of

1 this section shall not be eligible to purchase service credit that the member
2 would have otherwise been eligible to purchase prior to the member's initial
3 retirement.
4 (e) A member who returns to work under subsection (1) or (2) of this section, or
5 in the event of the death of the member, the member's estate or applicably
6 designated beneficiary, shall be entitled, within ninety (90) days of the posting
7 of the annual report submitted by the employer, to a refund of contributions as
8 permitted and limited by KRS 161.470;
9 (6) The board of trustees may annually, on July 1, adjust the current daily rate of a
10 member's last annual compensation, for each full twelve (12) month period that has
11 elapsed subsequent to the member earning his or her last annual compensation, by
12 the percentage increase in the annual average of the consumer price index for all
13 urban consumers for the calendar year preceding the adjustment as published by the
14 Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, not to exceed five percent (5%) annually. Each
15 annual adjustment shall become part of the member's daily rate base. Failure to
16 comply with the salary limitations set forth in subsections (1) and (2) of this section
17 as may be adjusted by this subsection shall result in a reduction of the member's
18 retirement allowance or any other benefit to which the member would otherwise be
19 entitled on a dollar-for-dollar basis for each dollar that the member exceeds these
20 salary limitations, and the member shall be refunded his or her retirement
21 contributions made on the compensation that exceeds these salary limitations.
22 Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, a member retiring from
23 a local school district who returns to work for a local school district under
24 subsection (1) or (2) of this section shall be entitled, without any reduction to his or
25 her retirement allowance or any other retirement benefit, to earn a minimum
26 amount equal to one hundred seventy dollars ($170) per day;
27 (7) (a) A retired member returning to work under subsection (1) or (2) of this section

1 shall have separated from service for a period of at least one (1) year if
2 returning to work for the same employer on a full-time basis, and at least three
3 (3) months if returning to work for a different employer on a full-time basis.
4 A retired member returning to work under subsection (1) or (2) of this section
5 on a part-time basis shall have separated from service for a period of at least
6 three (3) months before returning to work for any employer.
7 (b) As an alternative to the separation-from-service requirements in paragraph (a)
8 of this subsection, a retired member who is returning to work for the same
9 employer in a full-time position under subsections (1) and (2) of this section
10 may elect a separation-from-service of not less than two (2) months followed
11 by a forfeiture of the retired member's retirement allowance on a month-to-
12 month basis for each month that the member has separated from service for
13 less than twelve (12) full months. A retired member returning to work for the
14 same employer in a part-time position, or for a different employer in a full-
15 time position, may elect an alternative separation-from-service requirement of
16 at least two (2) months followed by a forfeiture of the member's retirement
17 allowance for one (1) month. During the period that the member forfeits his or
18 her retirement allowance and thereafter, member and employer contributions
19 shall be made to the retirement system as a result of employment in any
20 position subject to membership in the retirement system. The member shall
21 contribute to an account with the retirement system subject to the conditions
22 set forth in subsection (5) of this section.
23 (c) A retired member who is returning to work for an employer that has
24 employees who participate in the Teachers' Retirement System shall comply
25 with the separation-from-service requirements in this subsection before
26 performing any service for the employer, regardless of whether the retired
27 member is providing service in a position covered by the Teachers'

2 (d) The starting date for any separation from service required under this
3 subsection shall be the effective date of the member's retirement.
4 (e) The separation-from-service requirements of this subsection are not met if
5 there is a prearranged agreement between the member and an employer that
6 has employees who participate in the Teachers' Retirement System prior to
7 retirement for the member to work for the employer after retirement.
8 (f) The Teachers' Retirement System may require the member and the employer
9 for which the member is returning to work to certify in writing on a form
10 prescribed by the Teachers' Retirement System that no prearranged agreement
11 was or will be entered into between the member and employer prior to
12 retirement for the member to work for the employer after retirement.
13 (g) Failure to comply with the separation-from-service requirements in this
14 subsection voids a member's retirement and the member shall be required to
15 return all the retirement benefits he or she received, with interest, for the
16 period of time that the member returned to work without a sufficient
17 separation from service;
18 (8) (a) Effective July 1, 2004, local school districts may employ retired members in
19 full-time or part-time teaching or administrative positions without limitation
20 on the compensation of the retired members that is otherwise required by
21 subsections (1) and (2) of this section. Under provisions of this subsection, a
22 local school district may only employ retired members to fill critical shortage
23 positions for which there are no other qualified applicants as determined by
24 the local superintendent. The number of retired members that a local school
25 district may employ under this subsection shall be no more than two (2)
26 members per local school district or one percent (1%) of the total active
27 members employed by the local school district on a full-time basis as defined

3 from-service requirements set forth in subsection (7) of this section. Retired
4 members returning to work under this subsection shall waive their medical
5 insurance coverage with the retirement system during their period of
6 reemployment and receive medical insurance coverage that is offered to other

9 to the conditions set forth in subsection (5) of this section. Retired members
10 returning to work under this subsection shall make contributions to the
11 retirement system at the rate provided under KRS 161.540. The employer

14 compensation paid to the reemployed retirees at the rates determined by the
15 retirement system's actuary that reflect any accrued liability resulting from the
16 reemployment of these members.
17 (b) The Department of Education may employ retired members in full-time or
18 part-time teaching or nonteaching positions without the limitations on
19 compensation otherwise required by subsections (1) and (2) of this section to

2 a position substantially similar to the one from which they retired, or a position
3 described in KRS 161.046 or any position listed in KRS 161.220(4) which requires
4 membership in the retirement system. Positions which generally require

6 of employment which are created, or changed to remove the position from coverage
7 under KRS 161.220(4) are also subject to the return to work limitations set forth in
8 this section. The board of trustees shall determine whether employment in a
9 nonteaching position is subject to this subsection;

3 retirement shall not be used to improve an annuity, except as provided in
4 paragraphs (b) and (c) of this subsection;
5 (b) Any member who waives regular annuity benefits and returns to teaching or
6 covered employment shall be entitled to make contributions on the salaries
7 received for this service and have his or her retirement annuity recalculated as
8 provided in the regular retirement formula in KRS 161.620(1), less any
9 applicable actuarial discount applied to the original retirement allowance due
10 to the election of a joint and last survivor option. Retirement option and
11 beneficiary designation on original retirement shall not be altered by
12 postretirement employment, and dependents and spouses of the members shall
13 not become eligible for benefits under KRS 161.520, 161.525, or 161.661
14 because of postretirement employment;

20 1 following completion of the contract year or on the first day of the month
21 following the month of termination of service if full-time employment
22 exceeds one (1) consecutive contract year. A member shall not be returned to
23 the annuity rolls until after he or she has filed a retirement application in
24 compliance with KRS 161.600(5)[(6)]. Any discounts applied at the time of
25 the original retirement due to service or age may be reduced or eliminated due
26 to additional employment if full-time employment is for one (1) consecutive
27 contract year or longer; and

17 time teaching, substitute teaching, or part-time employment in a nonteaching
18 capacity under this section shall not exceed the ratio between a school year and the
19 actual months of retirement for the member during that school year. The board of
20 trustees by administrative regulation may establish fractional equivalents of a day
21 of teaching service. Any member who exceeds the twelve (12) hour or one hundred

23 member's retirement allowance shall not change regardless of the retirement option
24 selected by the member, even if the removed beneficiary predeceases the member.
25 (4) A member who experiences a qualifying event under subsection (2) of this section
26 and who elects a new optional plan of payment shall make that election within sixty
27 (60) days of the qualifying event.

1 Section 18. KRS 161.661 is amended to read as follows:
2 (1) (a) Any member who is accredited by the Teachers' Retirement System for five
3 (5) or more years of service in Kentucky after July 1, 1941, may retire for
4 disability and be granted a disability allowance if found to be eligible as
5 provided in this section. Application for disability benefits shall be made
6 within one (1) year of the last contributing service in Kentucky, and the
7 disability must have occurred during the most recent period of employment in
8 a position covered by the Teachers' Retirement System and subsequent to the
9 accreditation by the Teachers' Retirement System of five (5) years of
10 retirement system service credit in Kentucky. A disability occurring during
11 the regular vacation immediately following the last period of active service in
12 Kentucky or during an official leave for which the member is entitled to make
13 regular contributions to the retirement system, shall be considered as having
14 occurred during a period of active service.
15 (b) The annual disability allowance shall be equal to sixty percent (60%) of the
16 member's final average salary.
17 (c) The following individuals shall not be eligible for disability benefits under
18 this section:
19 1. Members with twenty-seven (27) or more years of service credit; and
20 2. Individuals who become members on or after July 1, 2021, who are
21 eligible for an unreduced benefit under KRS 161.600(1)(b)2. or (d).
22 (2) The provisions of KRS 161.520, 161.525, and subsections (3), (4), and (5) of this
23 section shall not apply to disability retirees whose benefits were calculated on the
24 service retirement formula nor to survivors of these members.
25 (3) Members shall earn one (1) year of entitlement to disability retirement, at sixty
26 percent (60%) of the member's final average salary, for each four (4) years of
27 service in a covered position, but any member meeting the service requirement for
Page 72 of 79
XXXX 1/7/2025 2:52 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1078
1 disability retirement shall be credited with no less than five (5) years of eligibility.
2 (4) A member retired by reason of disability shall continue to earn service credit at the
3 rate of one (1) year for each year retired for disability. This service shall be credited
4 to the member's account at the expiration of entitlement as defined in subsection (3)
5 of this section, or when the member's eligibility for disability benefits is terminated
6 upon recommendation of a medical review committee, and this service shall be
7 used in calculating benefits as provided in subsection (5) of this section, but under
8 no circumstances shall this service be used to provide the member with more than
9 twenty-seven (27) years of total service credit. The service credit shall be valued at
10 the same level as service earned by active members as provided under KRS 161.600
11 or 161.620.
12 (5) Any member retired by reason of disability and remaining disabled at the expiration
13 of the entitlement period shall have his or her disability benefits recalculated using
14 the service retirement formula with service credit earned as set out in subsection (4)
15 of this section. The retirement allowance shall be calculated as set forth in KRS
16 161.620, except that those persons less than sixty (60) years of age shall be
17 considered as sixty (60) years of age. Members having their disability benefits
18 recalculated under this subsection shall not be entitled to a benefit based upon an
19 average of their three (3) highest salaries as set forth in KRS 161.220(9), unless
20 approved otherwise by the board of trustees.
21 (6) Members who have their disability retirement allowance recalculated at the
22 expiration of the entitlement period shall continue to have coverage under the post-
23 retirement medical insurance program. Restrictions on employment shall remain in
24 effect until the member attains age seventy (70) or until the member's eligibility is
25 discontinued. KRS 161.520 and 161.525 shall not apply to survivors of disability
26 retirees whose retirement allowances have been recalculated at the expiration of the
27 entitlement period. Members who have their disability retirement allowance
Page 73 of 79
XXXX 1/7/2025 2:52 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1078
1 recalculated at the expiration of their entitlement period shall be entitled to a
2 minimum monthly allowance of five hundred dollars ($500) as the basic straight
3 life annuity. The minimum allowance shall be effective July 1, 1992, and shall
4 apply to those members who have had their allowance recalculated prior to that date
5 and to disability retirees who will have their benefit allowance recalculated on or
6 after that date. For individuals who become members on or after July 1, 2021,
7 disability retirement payments and any other recurring payments payable by any
8 other state-administered retirement system shall be applied to reduce, on a dollar-
9 for-dollar basis, the minimum monthly disability retirement allowance payable
10 under this subsection.
11 (7) Effective July 1, 1992, members retired for disability prior to July 1, 1964, shall be
12 entitled to a minimum monthly allowance of five hundred dollars ($500) as their
13 basic straight life annuity and their surviving spouse shall be eligible for survivor
14 benefits as provided in KRS 161.520(1)(a) and (b).
15 (8) Any member retired by reason of disability may voluntarily waive disability
16 benefits and return to teaching or any member, who is age sixty (60) years or older,
17 may elect to waive disability benefits and retire for service on the basis of service
18 credited to the member on the effective date of the disability retirement.
19 (9) In order to qualify for retirement by reason of disability a member must suffer from
20 a physical or mental condition presumed to be permanent in duration and of a
21 nature as to render the member incapable of being gainfully employed in a covered
22 position. The incapability must be revealed by a competent examination by a
23 licensed physician or physicians and must be approved by a majority of a medical
24 review committee.
25 (10) A member retired by reason of disability shall be required to undergo periodic
26 examinations at the discretion of the board of trustees to determine whether the
27 disability allowance shall be continued. When examination and recommendation of
Page 74 of 79
XXXX 1/7/2025 2:52 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1078
1 a medical review committee indicate the disability no longer exists, the allowance
2 shall be discontinued.
3 (11) Eligibility for payment shall begin on the first day of the month following receipt of
4 the application in the Teachers' Retirement System office, or the first of the month
5 next following the last payment of salary or sick leave benefits by the employer,
6 whichever is the later date.
7 (12) No person who receives a disability allowance may be employed in a position that
8 entails duties or qualification requirements similar to positions subject to
9 participation in the retirement system either within or without the State of
10 Kentucky. So doing shall constitute a misdemeanor and shall result in loss of the
11 allowance from the first date of this service. For purposes of this subsection and
12 subsection (13) of this section, "employment" and "occupation," and derivatives
13 thereof, mean any activity engaged in by the member receiving disability allowance
14 from which income is earned. A member who applies for and is approved for
15 disability retirement on or after July 1, 2002, and whose annual disability benefit is
16 less than forty thousand dollars ($40,000) may earn income in any occupation other
17 than covered employment only to the extent that the annual income from the other
18 employment when added to the annual disability benefit does not exceed forty
19 thousand dollars ($40,000). For any member who exceeds this limit as a result of
20 income from other employment, the Kentucky Teachers' Retirement System shall
21 reduce the member's disability benefit on a dollar-for-dollar basis for each dollar
22 that the member's combined annual disability benefit and annual income from other
23 employment exceeds forty thousand dollars ($40,000). The board of trustees may
24 annually increase the forty thousand dollar ($40,000) limit by the percentage
25 increase in the annual average of the consumer price index for all urban consumers
26 for the most recent calendar year as published by the Federal Bureau of Labor
27 Statistics, not to exceed five percent (5%). The retirement system may require
Page 75 of 79
XXXX 1/7/2025 2:52 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1078
1 income verification from the member, including but not limited to copies of tax
2 returns and federal forms W-2 and W-4P.
3 (13) All members who applied for disability retirement before July 1, 2002, and were
4 approved as a result of that application shall be subject to the income limitations as
5 they existed on June 30, 2002, until July 1, 2006. Effective July 1, 2006, the
6 twenty-seven thousand dollar ($27,000) limitation shall be increased to forty
7 thousand dollars ($40,000) and may be adjusted by the board of trustees by the
8 consumer price index in the manner described in subsection (12) of this section.
9 The recipient of a disability allowance who engages in any gainful occupation other
10 than covered employment must make a report of the duties involved, compensation
11 received, and any other pertinent information required by the board of trustees. The
12 retirement system may require income verification from the member, including but
13 not limited to copies of tax returns and federal forms W-2 and W-4P.
14 (14) The board of trustees shall designate medical review committees, each consisting of
15 three (3) licensed physicians. A medical review committee shall pass upon all
16 applications for disability retirement and upon all applicant statements, medical
17 certifications, and examinations submitted in connection with disability
18 applications. The disposition of each case shall be recommended by a medical
19 review committee in writing to the retirement system. Members of a medical review
20 committee shall follow administrative regulations regarding procedures as the board
21 of trustees may enact and shall be paid reasonable fees and expenses as authorized
22 by the board of trustees in compliance with the provisions of KRS 161.330 and
23 161.340. The retirement system may secure additional medical examinations and
24 information as it deems necessary. A member may appeal any final agency decision
25 denying his or her disability retirement application pursuant to the provisions of
26 KRS 161.250(2).
27 (15) A disability may be presumed to be permanent if the condition creating the
Page 76 of 79
XXXX 1/7/2025 2:52 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1078
1 disability may be reasonably expected to continue for one (1) year or more from the
2 date of application for disability benefits.
3 (16) Any member who has voluntarily waived disability benefits or whose disability
4 benefits have been discontinued on recommendation of a medical review
5 committee, may apply for reinstatement of disability benefits. The application for
6 reinstatement must be made to the retirement system within twelve (12) months of
7 the date disability benefits terminated. If the termination of benefits were voluntary,
8 the reinstatement may be made without medical examination if application is made
9 within three (3) months of the termination date. Other applications for reinstatement
10 will be processed in the same manner as new applications for benefits.
11 (17) No person who is receiving disability benefits under this section may be employed
12 in a position which qualifies the person for membership in a retirement system
13 financed wholly or in part with public funds. Employment in a position prohibited
14 by this subsection shall result in disqualification for those disability benefits from
15 the date of employment in the prohibited position.
16 (18) Any person who is receiving benefits and becomes disqualified from receiving
17 those benefits under this section, or becomes disqualified from receiving a portion
18 of those benefits due to income from other than covered employment, shall
19 immediately notify the Teachers' Retirement System of this disqualification in
20 writing and shall return all benefits paid after the date of disqualification. Failure to
21 comply with these provisions shall create an indebtedness of that person to the
22 Teachers' Retirement System. Interest at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum
23 shall be charged if the debt is not repaid within sixty (60) days after the date of
24 disqualification. Failure to repay this debt creates a lien in favor of the Teachers'
25 Retirement System upon all property of the person who improperly receives
26 benefits and does not repay those benefits. The Teachers' Retirement System may,
27 in order to collect an outstanding debt, reduce or terminate any benefit that a

1 member is otherwise entitled to receive.
2 [(19) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section to the contrary, individuals who
3 become members on or after January 1, 2022, shall be eligible for an actuarially
4 determined disability benefit as prescribed by the board of trustees via
5 administrative regulations promulgated by the board. The board of trustees shall
6 arrange by appropriate contract or on a self-insured basis a disability plan to
7 provide the disability benefits and may adjust the benefits in accordance with KRS
8 161.633(3) or 161.634(3).]
9 Section 19. The following KRS sections are repealed:
10 161.633 Foundational component for persons who became nonuniversity members on or
11 after January 1, 2022 -- Valuation assessment -- Adjustments to maintain funding
12 level and contain costs -- Construction.
13 161.634 Foundational component for persons who became university members on or
14 after January 1, 2022 -- Valuation assessment -- Adjustments to maintain funding

21 after January 1, 2022 -- Benefit -- Contributions -- Election upon termination of
22 employment and upon retirement -- Plans authorized under Internal Revenue

24 Section 20. Individuals who became members of the Teachers' Retirement
25 System on or after January 1, 2022, but prior to the effective date of this Act, who would
26 have otherwise been eligible for the benefits and rights provided by 2021 Ky. Acts ch.
27 157, shall be provided the benefits and rights that were applicable to individuals who

1 became members of the Teachers' Retirement System immediately prior to January 1,

3 Section 21. Whereas recruiting and retaining the best and brightest teachers to
4 educate and inspire future generations of Kentuckians is crucial to the success, health,
5 and financial well-being of all citizens of the Commonwealth, an emergency is declared
6 to exist, and this Act takes effect upon its passage and approval by the Governor or upon
7 its otherwise becoming a law.
