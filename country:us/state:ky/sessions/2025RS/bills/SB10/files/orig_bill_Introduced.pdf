11 3. The system shall continue to provide the same hospital and medical
12 insurance plan coverage for recipients and qualifying dependents after

13 subsidy under subsection (4)(e)2. of this section shall be reimbursed by the
14 system to the recipient up to the amount individually paid by the recipient to

16 nonhazardous position, the reimbursement shall be limited to the amount
17 paid by the recipient to obtain single coverage.
18 (c) For purposes of recipients described by paragraph (a)1. of this subsection, the
19 plan shall not be made available if all recipients are eligible for the same
20 coverage as recipients living in Kentucky.

23 during the 2025 Interim, evaluate potential legislative options to adjust retiree health
