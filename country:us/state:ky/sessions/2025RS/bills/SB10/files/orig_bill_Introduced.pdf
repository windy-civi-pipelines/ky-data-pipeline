11 medical insurance plans established, contracted, or authorized by
12 the system.
13 2. Any recipient who chooses coverage under a hospital and medical

10 the system.
11 3. The system shall continue to provide the same hospital and medical
12 insurance plan coverage for recipients and qualifying dependents after

13 subsidy under subsection (4)(e)2. of this section shall be reimbursed by the
14 system to the recipient up to the amount individually paid by the recipient to

16 nonhazardous position, the reimbursement shall be limited to the amount
17 paid by the recipient to obtain single coverage.
18 (c) For purposes of recipients described by paragraph (a)1. of this subsection, the

23 during the 2025 Interim, evaluate potential legislative options to adjust retiree health
