1 than, the processes, strategies, evidentiary standards, or other factors
2 used in applying the criteria or limitation to medical and surgical

15 1. A description of the process used to develop or select the medical
16 necessity criteria for both mental health condition benefits and medical
17 and surgical benefits;

24 in subparagraph 1. of this paragraph and for each nonquantitative
25 treatment limitation identified in subparagraph 2. of this paragraph, as
26 written and in operation. At a minimum, the results of the analysis shall:
27 a. Identify the factors used to determine that a nonquantitative

1 treatment limitation will apply to a benefit, including factors that
2 were considered but rejected;
3 b. Identify and define the specific evidentiary standards used to
4 define the factors and any other evidence relied upon in designing
5 each nonquantitative treatment limitation;
6 c. Provide the comparative analyses, including the results of the
7 analyses, performed to determine that the processes and strategies:
8 i. Used to design each nonquantitative treatment limitation, as
9 written, and the as-written processes and strategies used to
10 apply the nonquantitative treatment limitation to mental
11 health condition benefits are comparable to, and are applied
12 no more stringently than, the processes and strategies used to
13 design each nonquantitative treatment limitation, as written,
14 and the as-written processes and strategies used to apply the
15 nonquantitative treatment limitation to medical and surgical
16 benefits; and
17 ii. Used to apply each nonquantitative treatment limitation, in
18 operation, for mental health condition benefits are
19 comparable to, and are applied no more stringently than, the
20 processes and strategies used to apply each nonquantitative
21 treatment limitation, in operation, for medical and surgical
22 benefits; and
23 d. Disclose the specific findings and conclusions reached by the
24 insurer that the results of the analyses performed under this
25 subparagraph indicate that the insurer is in compliance with
26 subsection (1)(b) and (c) of this section; and
27 4. Any additional information that may be prescribed by the commissioner

1 for use in determining compliance with the requirements of this section.
2 (b) The annual report shall be submitted in a manner and format prescribed by the
3 commissioner through administrative regulation.
4 (3) A willful violation of this section shall constitute an act of discrimination and shall
5 be an unfair trade practice under this chapter. The remedies provided under Subtitle
6 12 of this chapter shall apply to conduct in violation of this section.
7 Section 2. Whereas parity in the provision of mental health condition benefits is
8 imperative to the health and well-being of the citizens of the Commonwealth, an
9 emergency is declared to exist, and this Act takes effect upon its passage and approval by
10 the Governor or upon its otherwise becoming a law.
