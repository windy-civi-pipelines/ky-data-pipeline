9 zoning regulations and shall be in addition to any zoning regulations that are
10 generally applicable to single-family residences. Any architectural compatibility
11 standards applied to qualified manufactured homes must be equivalent to, and
12 not more stringent than, those standards applied to other single family residential
13 structures in the same zone. No compatibility standard shall be adopted or
14 enforced if that standard is not also required for all other new site-built, single
15 family residential construction within the same zone.[The compatibility standards
16 shall be designed to ensure that when a qualified manufactured home is placed in a
17 residential zone it is compatible, in terms of assessed value, with existing housing
18 located with a one-eighth (1/8) mile or less radius from the proposed location of the
19 qualified manufactured home.] The compatibility standards adopted by a local

23 (a) Roof pitch;[
24 (b) Square footage of livable space;]

1 (4) A manufactured home that does not meet the minimum width of twenty (20) feet
2 or minimum living area of nine hundred (900) square feet to be considered a
3 qualified manufactured home under paragraph (1)(d) of this section shall be
4 treated as a qualified manufactured home for purposes of subsections (2) and (3)
5 of this section if:
6 (a) The lot dimensions or setback requirements would not reasonably
7 accommodate a home meeting these minimum dimensions;
8 (b) The home is the maximum width and square footage that could reasonably
9 fit on the lot while complying with all applicable setback requirements and
10 other zoning regulations; and
11 (c) The home otherwise meets all other requirements of a qualified
12 manufactured home under this section.
13 (5)[(4)] Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect, modify, or abolish
14 restrictions contained in recorded deeds, covenants, or developers' subdivision
15 restrictions.
16 (6)[(5)] Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting in any way the authority
17 of local governments to adopt regulations designed to protect historic properties or
18 historic districts.
19 (7) Any zoning regulation, ordinance, or requirement that violates this section is void
20 and unenforceable.
21 Section 2. The Kentucky General Assembly hereby recognizes and affirms that
22 while local governments have legitimate authority to enact reasonable zoning regulations,
23 the provision of quality, affordable housing through qualified manufactured homes serves
24 an essential public purpose. Local governments may enact reasonable compatibility
25 standards as specified in Section 1 of this Act, but these standards shall not be used to
26 exclude qualified manufactured homes from residential zones where single-family homes
27 are permitted.
