(c) Imposes foundation requirements on manufactured homes that:

Section 10:
1. Conflict with the structural engineering of the homes;

Section 11:
2. Conflict with KRS 227.570; or

Section 12:
3. Require more than one (1) type of permanent foundation system.
(4)[(3)] Any local government may adopt and enforce, as a part of its zoning regulations, compatibility
standards governing the placement of qualified manufactured homes in residential zones within the local
government's jurisdiction. Compatibility standards shall be adopted, amended, and enforced in the same
manner as other zoning regulations and shall be in addition to any zoning regulations that are generally
applicable to single-family residences. Any architectural compatibility standards applied to qualified
manufactured homes must be equivalent to, and not more stringent than, those standards applied to other
single-family residential structures in the same zone. The compatibility standards shall be designed to ensure
that when a qualified manufactured home is placed in a residential zone it is compatible, in terms of assessed
value, with existing housing located with a one-eighth (1/8) mile or less radius from the proposed location of
the qualified manufactured home. The compatibility standards adopted by a local government shall be
limited[relate] to the following architectural features that have a significant impact on the overall assessed
value of the structure[, including, for example, but not limited to features such as]:
(a) Roof pitch;
(b) Square footage of livable space;
(c) Type and quality of exterior finishing materials;
(d) Foundation skirting;[ and]
(e) Existence and type of attached structures; and
(f) Setback restrictions, lot dimensions, and orientation of the home on the lot, so long as they are no
stricter than those for site-built homes within the same zone.
(5) A manufactured home that does not meet the minimum width of twenty (20) feet or minimum total living
area of nine hundred (900) square feet needed to be considered a qualified manufactured home under
subsection (2)(d) of this section may be treated as a qualified manufactured home for purposes of
subsections (3) and (4) of this section if:
(a) The setback requirements or lot dimensions would not reasonably accommodate a home meeting
these minimum dimensions;
(b) The home is the maximum width and square footage that could reasonably fit on the lot while
complying with all applicable setback requirements and other zoning regulations; and
(c) The home otherwise meets all other requirements of a qualified manufactured home under this

Section 13:
section.
(6)[(4)] [Nothing in ]This section shall not be construed to affect, modify, or abolish restrictions contained in
recorded deeds, covenants, or developers' subdivision restrictions.
(7)[(5)] [Nothing in ]This section shall not be construed as limiting in any way the authority of local
governments to adopt regulations designed to protect historic properties or historic districts.
(8) Any zoning regulation, ordinance, or requirement that violates this section is void and unenforceable.
(9) Cities located in a county containing a consolidated local government that do not have the authority to
adopt zoning regulations as set out in KRS 100.137(3), may enact compatibility standards pursuant to
subsection (4) of this section that are in lieu of standards adopted by the consolidated local government.
