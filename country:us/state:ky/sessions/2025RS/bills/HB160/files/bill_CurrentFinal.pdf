8 Compatibility standards shall be adopted, amended, and enforced in the same
9 manner as other zoning regulations and shall be in addition to any zoning
10 regulations that are generally applicable to single-family residences. Any
11 architectural compatibility standards applied to qualified manufactured homes
12 must be equivalent to, and not more stringent than, those standards applied to
13 other single-family residential structures in the same zone. The compatibility
14 standards shall be designed to ensure that when a qualified manufactured home is
15 placed in a residential zone it is compatible, in terms of assessed value, with
16 existing housing located with a one-eighth (1/8) mile or less radius from the
17 proposed location of the qualified manufactured home. The compatibility standards
18 adopted by a local government shall be limited[relate] to the following architectural
19 features that have a significant impact on the overall assessed value of the

21 (a) Roof pitch;
22 (b) Square footage of livable space;
23 (c) Type and quality of exterior finishing materials;
24 (d) Foundation skirting;[ and]
25 (e) Existence and type of attached structures; and
26 (f) Setback restrictions, lot dimensions, and orientation of the home on the lot,
27 so long as they are no stricter than those for site-built homes within the

1 same zone.
2 (5) A manufactured home that does not meet the minimum width of twenty (20) feet
3 or minimum total living area of nine hundred (900) square feet needed to be
4 considered a qualified manufactured home under subsection (2)(d) of this section
5 may be treated as a qualified manufactured home for purposes of subsections (3)
6 and (4) of this section if:
7 (a) The setback requirements or lot dimensions would not reasonably
8 accommodate a home meeting these minimum dimensions;
9 (b) The home is the maximum width and square footage that could reasonably
10 fit on the lot while complying with all applicable setback requirements and
11 other zoning regulations; and
12 (c) The home otherwise meets all other requirements of a qualified
13 manufactured home under this section.
14 (6)[(4)] [Nothing in ]This section shall not be construed to affect, modify, or abolish
15 restrictions contained in recorded deeds, covenants, or developers' subdivision
16 restrictions.
17 (7)[(5)] [Nothing in ]This section shall not be construed as limiting in any way the
18 authority of local governments to adopt regulations designed to protect historic
19 properties or historic districts.
20 (8) Any zoning regulation, ordinance, or requirement that violates this section is void
21 and unenforceable.
22 (9) Cities located in a county containing a consolidated local government that do not
23 have the authority to adopt zoning regulations as set out in KRS 100.137(3), may
24 enact compatibility standards pursuant to subsection (4) of this section that are in
25 lieu of standards adopted by the consolidated local government.
