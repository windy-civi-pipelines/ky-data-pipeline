(2) (a) During the term of an easement the landowner and the landowner's assigns, agents, or leasees shall not
perform, nor knowingly allow others to perform, any act on or affecting the restricted land that is
inconsistent with the provisions of this section. The landowner shall be deemed to have authorized the
PACE board to enforce these provisions.
(b) Unless otherwise specified, the landowner shall not be required to take any action to restore the
condition of the restricted land after any act of God or other event over which the landowner had no
control.
(c) Nothing in the PACE Program shall relieve the landowner of any obligation or restriction on the use of
the property imposed by law.
(d) The Commonwealth shall not locate landfills, sewage treatment plants, or other public service facilities
that are not compatible with or complimentary to agricultural production on restricted lands.
(3) (a) To retain the agricultural viability of the restricted land, the PACE board shall require, and the owner of
the restricted land shall implement, a conservation plan approved by the soil and water conservation
district. This plan shall be updated every ten (10) years and any time the basic farming operation
conducted on restricted lands is changed. All farming operations shall be conducted substantially in
accordance with the plan.
(b) In addition to the requirements established by the soil and water conservation district, the conservation
plan shall require that:
1. The use of the land for growing sod, nursery stock, and ornamental trees and shrubs does not
remove excessive soil from the restricted land;
2. The excavation of soil, sand, gravel, stone, or other materials for use in agricultural production
on the restricted land is consistent with subsection (4)(h) of this section and is conducted in a
location and manner that retains the viability of the restricted land for agricultural production;
and

their current locations without further permission of the PACE board. No new single-family residential
dwellings may be built on the restricted land without the advance approval of the PACE board. The

the restricted land.

timber harvesting on the restricted land shall be conducted on a sustainable yield basis and in
substantial accordance with a forest management plan prepared by a competent professional forester.

using any method that disturbs the surface of the land, is prohibited without the advance written
approval of the PACE board. The PACE board shall give approval within a reasonable time, unless it
determines that the proposed mining or extraction will substantially diminish or impair the agricultural
productivity of the restricted land.
