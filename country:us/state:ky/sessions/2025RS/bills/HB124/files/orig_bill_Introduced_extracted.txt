7 (b) A fine authorized by KRS Chapter 534; or
8 (c) Both imprisonment and a fine unless precluded by the provisions of KRS
9 Chapter 534.
10 (4) (a) When a person is convicted of any capital offense, felony offense, or offense
11 where the defendant is found guilty but mentally ill, the judge pronouncing
12 sentence shall order in open court that the defendant be prohibited from
13 possessing a firearm and shall order him or her to surrender any firearms
14 owned or possessed by the defendant to the sheriff of the county where the

25 (5) In all cases in which the death penalty may be authorized the judge shall instruct the
26 jury in accordance with subsection (1) of this section. The instructions shall state,
27 subject to the aggravating and mitigating limitations and requirements of KRS
Page 19 of 28
XXXX 12/17/2024 3:30 PM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 467
1 532.025, that the jury may recommend upon a conviction for a capital offense a
2 sentence of death, or at a term of imprisonment for life without benefit of probation
3 or parole, or a term of imprisonment for life without benefit of probation or parole
4 until the defendant has served a minimum of twenty-five (25) years of his or her
5 sentence, or a sentence of life, or to a term of not less than twenty (20) years nor
6 more than fifty (50) years.
7 Section 17. KRS 532.025 is amended to read as follows:
8 (1) (a) Upon conviction of a defendant in cases where the death penalty may be
9 imposed, a hearing shall be conducted. In such hearing, the judge shall hear
10 additional evidence in extenuation, mitigation, and aggravation of
11 punishment, including the record of any prior criminal convictions and pleas
12 of guilty or pleas of nolo contendere of the defendant, or the absence of any
13 prior conviction and pleas; provided, however, that only such evidence in
14 aggravation as the state has made known to the defendant prior to his or her
15 trial shall be admissible. Subject to the Kentucky Rules of Evidence, juvenile
16 court records of adjudications of guilt of a child for an offense that would be a
17 felony if committed by an adult shall be admissible in court at any time the
18 child is tried as an adult, or after the child becomes an adult, at any
19 subsequent criminal trial relating to that same person. Juvenile court records
20 made available pursuant to this section may be used for impeachment
21 purposes during a criminal trial and may be used during the sentencing phase
22 of a criminal trial; however, the fact that a juvenile has been adjudicated
23 delinquent of an offense that would be a felony if the child had been an adult
24 shall not be used in finding the child to be a persistent felony offender based
25 upon that adjudication. Release of the child's treatment, medical, mental, or
26 psychological records is prohibited unless presented as evidence in Circuit
27 Court. Release of any records resulting from the child's prior abuse and
Page 20 of 28

1 neglect under Title IV-E or IV-B of the Federal Social Security Act is also
2 prohibited. The judge shall also hear argument by the defendant or his or her
3 counsel and the prosecuting attorney, as provided by law, regarding the
4 punishment to be imposed. The prosecuting attorney shall open and the
5 defendant shall conclude the argument. In cases in which the death penalty
6 may be imposed, the judge when sitting without a jury shall follow the
7 additional procedure provided in subsection (2) of this section. Upon the
8 conclusion of the evidence and arguments, the judge shall impose the sentence
9 or shall recess the trial for the purpose of taking the sentence within the limits
10 prescribed by law. If the trial court is reversed on appeal because of error only
11 in the presentence hearing, the new trial which may be ordered shall apply
12 only to the issue of punishment.
13 (b) In all cases in which the death penalty may be imposed and which are tried by
14 a jury, upon a return of a verdict of guilty by the jury, the court shall resume
15 the trial and conduct a presentence hearing before the jury. Such hearing shall
16 be conducted in the same manner as presentence hearings conducted before
17 the judge as provided in paragraph (a) of this subsection, including the record
18 of any prior criminal convictions and pleas of guilty or pleas of nolo
19 contendere of the defendant. Upon the conclusion of the evidence and
20 arguments, the judge shall give the jury appropriate instructions, and the jury
21 shall retire to determine whether any mitigating or aggravating circumstances,
22 as defined in subsection (2) of this section, exist and to recommend a sentence
23 for the defendant. Upon the findings of the jury, the judge shall fix a sentence
24 within the limits prescribed by law.
25 (2) In all cases of offenses for which the death penalty may be authorized, the judge
26 shall consider, or include in the[his or her] instructions to the jury for it to consider,
27 any mitigating circumstances or aggravating circumstances otherwise authorized by
Page 21 of 28

1 law and any of the following statutory aggravating or mitigating circumstances
2 which may be supported by the evidence:
3 (a) Aggravating circumstances:
4 1. The offense of murder or kidnapping was committed by a person with a
5 prior record of conviction for a capital offense, or the offense of murder
6 was committed by a person who has a substantial history of serious
7 assaultive criminal convictions;
8 2. The offense of murder or kidnapping was committed while the offender
9 was engaged in the commission of arson in the first degree, robbery in

12 3. The offender by his or her act of murder, armed robbery, or kidnapping
13 knowingly created a great risk of death to more than one (1) person in a
14 public place by means of a weapon of mass destruction, weapon, or
15 other device which would normally be hazardous to the lives of more
16 than one (1) person;

18 another, for the purpose of receiving money or any other thing of
19 monetary value, or for other profit;

2 or a domestic violence order was in effect, or when any other order
3 designed to protect the victim from the offender, such as an order issued
4 as a condition of a bond, conditional release, probation, parole, or
5 pretrial diversion, was in effect; and
6 9. The offender's act of killing was intentional and resulted in the death of
7 a child under twelve (12) years old.
8 (b) Mitigating circumstances:
9 1. The defendant has no significant history of prior criminal activity;
10 2. The capital offense was committed while the defendant was under the
11 influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance even though the

13 constitute a defense to the crime;
14 3. The victim was a participant in the defendant's criminal conduct or
15 consented to the criminal act;
16 4. The capital offense was committed under circumstances which the
17 defendant believed to provide a moral justification or extenuation for his

1 appreciate the criminality of his or her conduct to the requirements of
2 law was impaired as a result of mental illness or an intellectual disability
3 or intoxication even though the impairment of the capacity of the
4 defendant to appreciate the criminality of his or her conduct or to
5 conform the conduct to the requirements of law is insufficient to
6 constitute a defense to the crime; and
7 8. The youth of the defendant at the time of the crime.
8 (3) The instructions as determined by the trial judge to be warranted by the evidence or
9 as required by KRS 532.030(5)[(4)] shall be given in charge and in writing to the
10 jury for its deliberation. The jury, if its verdict be a recommendation of death, or
11 imprisonment for life without benefit of probation or parole, or imprisonment for
12 life without benefit of probation or parole until the defendant has served a minimum
13 of twenty-five (25) years of his or her sentence, shall designate in writing, signed by
14 the foreman of the jury, the aggravating circumstance or circumstances which it
15 found beyond a reasonable doubt. In nonjury cases, the judge shall make such
16 designation. In all cases unless at least one (1) of the statutory aggravating
17 circumstances enumerated in subsection (2) of this section is so found, the death
18 penalty, or imprisonment for life without benefit of probation or parole, or the
19 sentence to imprisonment for life without benefit of probation or parole until the
20 defendant has served a minimum of twenty-five (25) years of his or her sentence,
21 shall not be imposed.

7 Section 17. KRS 532.025 is amended to read as follows:

11 punishment, including the record of any prior criminal convictions and pleas
12 of guilty or pleas of nolo contendere of the defendant, or the absence of any

14 aggravation as the state has made known to the defendant prior to his or her
15 trial shall be admissible. Subject to the Kentucky Rules of Evidence, juvenile

19 subsequent criminal trial relating to that same person. Juvenile court records
20 made available pursuant to this section may be used for impeachment

22 of a criminal trial; however, the fact that a juvenile has been adjudicated
23 delinquent of an offense that would be a felony if the child had been an adult
24 shall not be used in finding the child to be a persistent felony offender based
25 upon that adjudication. Release of the child's treatment, medical, mental, or
26 psychological records is prohibited unless presented as evidence in Circuit
27 Court. Release of any records resulting from the child's prior abuse and

2 prohibited. The judge shall also hear argument by the defendant or his or her
3 counsel and the prosecuting attorney, as provided by law, regarding the
4 punishment to be imposed. The prosecuting attorney shall open and the
5 defendant shall conclude the argument. In cases in which the death penalty
6 may be imposed, the judge when sitting without a jury shall follow the
7 additional procedure provided in subsection (2) of this section. Upon the
8 conclusion of the evidence and arguments, the judge shall impose the sentence
9 or shall recess the trial for the purpose of taking the sentence within the limits
10 prescribed by law. If the trial court is reversed on appeal because of error only
11 in the presentence hearing, the new trial which may be ordered shall apply
12 only to the issue of punishment.
13 (b) In all cases in which the death penalty may be imposed and which are tried by
14 a jury, upon a return of a verdict of guilty by the jury, the court shall resume
15 the trial and conduct a presentence hearing before the jury. Such hearing shall
16 be conducted in the same manner as presentence hearings conducted before
17 the judge as provided in paragraph (a) of this subsection, including the record
18 of any prior criminal convictions and pleas of guilty or pleas of nolo
19 contendere of the defendant. Upon the conclusion of the evidence and
20 arguments, the judge shall give the jury appropriate instructions, and the jury
21 shall retire to determine whether any mitigating or aggravating circumstances,
22 as defined in subsection (2) of this section, exist and to recommend a sentence
23 for the defendant. Upon the findings of the jury, the judge shall fix a sentence
24 within the limits prescribed by law.
25 (2) In all cases of offenses for which the death penalty may be authorized, the judge
26 shall consider, or include in the[his or her] instructions to the jury for it to consider,

8 (3) The instructions as determined by the trial judge to be warranted by the evidence or
9 as required by KRS 532.030(5)[(4)] shall be given in charge and in writing to the

12 life without benefit of probation or parole until the defendant has served a minimum
13 of twenty-five (25) years of his or her sentence, shall designate in writing, signed by
14 the foreman of the jury, the aggravating circumstance or circumstances which it
15 found beyond a reasonable doubt. In nonjury cases, the judge shall make such
