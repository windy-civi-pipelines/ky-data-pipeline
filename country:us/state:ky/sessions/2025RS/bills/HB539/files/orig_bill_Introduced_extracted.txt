Page 4 of 15

12 government for any other health care coverage shall be paid by the employee.
13 (4) If an employee moves his or her place of residence or employment out of the
14 service area of an insurer offering a managed health care plan, under which he or
15 she has elected coverage, into either the service area of another managed health care
16 plan or into an area of the Commonwealth not within a managed health care plan
17 service area, the employee shall be given an option, at the time of the move or
18 transfer, to change his or her coverage to another health benefit plan.
19 (5) No payment of premium by any department, board, agency, public postsecondary
20 educational institution, or branch of state, city, urban-county, charter county,
21 county, or consolidated local government shall constitute compensation to an
22 insured employee for the purposes of any statute fixing or limiting the
23 compensation of such an employee. Any premium or other expense incurred by any
24 department, board, agency, public postsecondary educational institution, or branch
25 of state, city, urban-county, charter county, county, or consolidated local

6 dependents.
7 (11) Interruption of an established treatment regime with maintenance drugs shall be
8 grounds for an insured to appeal a formulary change through the established appeal

11 (12) Any employee who is eligible for and elects to participate in the state health
12 insurance program as a retiree, or the spouse or beneficiary of a retiree, under any
13 one (1) of the state-sponsored retirement systems shall not be eligible to receive the
14 state health insurance contribution toward health care coverage as a result of any
15 other employment for which there is a public employer contribution. This does not
16 preclude a retiree and an active employee spouse from using both contributions to

7 pursuant to KRS 304.17A-132.

1 (19) The Personnel Cabinet is encouraged to study whether it is fair and reasonable and
2 in the best interests of the state group to allow any carrier bidding to offer health
3 care coverage under this section to submit bids that may vary county by county or
4 by larger geographic areas.
5 (20) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the bid for proposals for health
6 insurance coverage for calendar year 2004 shall include a bid scenario that reflects
7 the statewide rating structure provided in calendar year 2003 and a bid scenario that

10 (a) The regional rating bid scenario shall not include a request for bid on a
11 statewide option;
12 (b) The Personnel Cabinet shall divide the state into geographical regions which

23 contract for that region to no more than two (2) carriers; and
24 (e) Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit the Personnel Cabinet from including
25 other requirements or criteria in the request for proposal.
