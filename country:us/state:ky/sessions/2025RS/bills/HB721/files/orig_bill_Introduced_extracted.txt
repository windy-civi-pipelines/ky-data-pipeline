1 million dollars ($6,000,000) less the amount of the corporation's or
2 limited liability pass-through entity's Kentucky gross receipts for

13 (d)[(c)] A credit shall be allowed against the tax imposed under paragraph (a) of

15 through entity that owns an interest in a limited liability pass-through entity.
16 The credit shall be the proportionate share of tax calculated under this
17 subsection by the lower-level pass-through entity, as determined after the
18 amount of tax calculated by the pass-through entity has been reduced by the
19 minimum tax of one hundred seventy-five dollars ($175). The credit shall
20 apply across multiple layers of a multi-layered pass-through entity structure.
21 The credit at each layer shall include the credit from each lower layer, after
22 reduction for the minimum tax of one hundred seventy-five dollars ($175) at
23 each layer.

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1959
1 credit amount shall be determined as follows:
2 (a) The credit allowed a corporation subject to the tax imposed by KRS 141.040

4 section for the current year after subtraction of any credits identified in KRS
5 141.0205, reduced by the minimum tax of one hundred seventy-five dollars
6 ($175), plus any credit determined in paragraph (b) of this subsection for tax
7 paid by wholly or partially owned limited liability pass-through entities. The
8 amount of credit allowed to a corporation based on the amount of tax paid
9 under subsection (2) of this section for the current year shall be applied to the
10 income tax due from the corporation's activities in this state. Any remaining
11 credit from the corporation shall be disallowed.
12 (b) The credit allowed members, shareholders, or partners of a limited liability
13 pass-through entity shall be the members', shareholders', or partners'
14 proportionate share of the tax calculated under subsection (2) of this section
15 for the current year after subtraction of any credits identified in KRS
16 141.0205, as determined after the amount of tax paid has been reduced by the
17 minimum tax of one hundred seventy-five dollars ($175). The credit allowed
18 to members, shareholders, or partners of a limited liability pass-through entity
19 shall be applied to income tax assessed on income from the limited liability
20 pass-through entity. Any remaining credit from the limited liability pass-
21 through entity shall be disallowed.

23 prepared by the department, on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month
24 following the close of the taxpayer's taxable year. Any tax remaining due after
25 making the payments required in KRS 141.044 shall be paid by the original due
26 date of the return.
27 (5) The department shall prescribe forms and promulgate administrative regulations as

15 through entity that owns an interest in a limited liability pass-through entity.
16 The credit shall be the proportionate share of tax calculated under this
17 subsection by the lower-level pass-through entity, as determined after the
18 amount of tax calculated by the pass-through entity has been reduced by the
19 minimum tax of one hundred seventy-five dollars ($175). The credit shall
20 apply across multiple layers of a multi-layered pass-through entity structure.

5 141.0205, reduced by the minimum tax of one hundred seventy-five dollars
6 ($175), plus any credit determined in paragraph (b) of this subsection for tax
7 paid by wholly or partially owned limited liability pass-through entities. The
8 amount of credit allowed to a corporation based on the amount of tax paid
9 under subsection (2) of this section for the current year shall be applied to the
10 income tax due from the corporation's activities in this state. Any remaining
11 credit from the corporation shall be disallowed.
12 (b) The credit allowed members, shareholders, or partners of a limited liability
13 pass-through entity shall be the members', shareholders', or partners'
14 proportionate share of the tax calculated under subsection (2) of this section
15 for the current year after subtraction of any credits identified in KRS
16 141.0205, as determined after the amount of tax paid has been reduced by the
17 minimum tax of one hundred seventy-five dollars ($175). The credit allowed
18 to members, shareholders, or partners of a limited liability pass-through entity
19 shall be applied to income tax assessed on income from the limited liability
