Page 7 of 10

1 establishing and furthering television and related facilities as an aid or
2 supplement to classroom instruction throughout the Commonwealth and for
3 incidental use in any other proper public functions. The lease may be for any
4 initial term commencing with the date of the lease and ending with the next
5 ensuing June 30, which is the close of the then-current fiscal biennium of the
6 Commonwealth, with exclusive options in favor of the board to renew the
7 same for successive ensuing bienniums, July 1 in each even year to June 30 in
8 the next ensuing even year; and the rentals may be fixed at the sums in each
9 biennium, if renewed, sufficient to enable the State Property and Buildings
10 Commission to pay therefrom the maturing principal of and interest on, and
11 provide reserves for, any revenue bonds which the State Property and
12 Buildings Commission may determine to be necessary and sufficient, in
13 agreement with the board, to provide the cost of acquiring the television and
14 related facilities with appurtenances and costs as may be incident to the
15 issuance of the bonds.
16 (b) Each option of the Kentucky Board of Education to renew the lease for a
17 succeeding biennial term may be exercised at any time after the adjournment
18 of the session of the General Assembly at which appropriations shall have
19 been made for the operation of the state government for such succeeding
20 biennial term, by notifying the State Property and Buildings Commission in
21 writing, signed by the chief state school officer, and delivered to the secretary
22 of the Finance and Administration Cabinet as a member of the commission.
23 The option shall be deemed automatically exercised, and the lease
24 automatically renewed for the succeeding biennium, effective on the first day
25 thereof, unless a written notice of the board's election not to renew shall have
26 been delivered in the office of the secretary of the Finance and Administration
27 Cabinet before the close of business on the last working day in April

1 immediately preceding the beginning of the succeeding biennium.
2 (c) The Kentucky Board of Education shall not itself operate leased television
3 facilities, or undertake the preparation of the educational presentations or
4 films to be transmitted thereby, but may enter into one (1) or more contracts
5 to provide therefor, with any public agency and instrumentality of the
6 Commonwealth having, or able to provide, a staff with proper technical
7 qualifications, upon which agency and instrumentality the board, through the
8 chief state school officer and the Department of Education, is represented in
9 such manner as to coordinate matters of curriculum with the curricula
10 prescribed for the public schools of the Commonwealth. Any contract for the
11 operation of the leased television or related facilities may permit limited and
12 special uses of the television or related facilities for other programs in the
13 public interest, subject to the reasonable terms and conditions as the board and
14 the operating agency and instrumentality may agree upon; but any contract
15 shall affirmatively forbid the use of the television or related facilities, at any
16 time or in any manner, in the dissemination of political propaganda or in
17 furtherance of the interest of any political party or candidate for public office,
18 or for commercial advertising. No lease between the board and the State
19 Property and Buildings Commission shall bind the board to pay rentals for
20 more than one (1) fiscal biennium at a time, subject to the aforesaid renewal
21 options. The board may receive and may apply to rental payments under any
22 lease and to the cost of providing for the operation of the television or related
23 facilities not only appropriations which may be made to it from state funds,
24 from time to time, but also contributions, gifts, matching funds, devises, and
25 bequests from any source, whether federal or state, and whether public or
26 private, so long as the same are not conditioned upon any improper use of the
27 television or related facilities in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of

3 school officer, prescribe, print, publish, and distribute at public expense such
4 administrative regulations, courses of study, curriculums, bulletins, programs,
5 outlines, reports, and placards as each deems necessary for the efficient
6 management, control, and operation of the schools and programs under its

8 shall be enclosed in a booklet or binder on which the words "informational copy"
9 shall be clearly stamped or printed.
