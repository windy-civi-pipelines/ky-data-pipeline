bulletins, programs, outlines, reports, and placards as each deems necessary for the efficient management,
control, and operation of the schools and programs under its jurisdiction. All administrative regulations
published or distributed by the board shall be enclosed in a booklet or binder on which the words

appropriations which may be made to it from state funds, from time to time, but also contributions,
gifts, matching funds, devises, and bequests from any source, whether federal or state, and whether
public or private, so long as the same are not conditioned upon any improper use of the television or
related facilities in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of this subsection.

print, publish, and distribute at public expense such administrative regulations, courses of study, curriculums,
bulletins, programs, outlines, reports, and placards as each deems necessary for the efficient management,
control, and operation of the schools and programs under its jurisdiction. All administrative regulations
published or distributed by the board shall be enclosed in a booklet or binder on which the words
"informational copy" shall be clearly stamped or printed.
