1 profiling presents a reasonably foreseeable risk of:
2 1. Unfair or deceptive treatment of consumers or unlawful, disparate
3 impact on consumers;
4 2. Financial, physical, or reputational injury to consumers;

12 (2) Data protection impact assessments conducted under this section shall identify and

15 risks to the rights of the consumer associated with such processing, as mitigated by
16 safeguards that can be employed by the controller to reduce such risk. The use of
17 de-identified data and the reasonable expectations of consumers, as well as the

1 public inspection, and copying under KRS 61.870 to 61.884.
2 (5) The disclosure of a data protection impact assessment pursuant to a request from
3 the Attorney General under subsection (3) of this section does not constitute a
4 waiver of the attorney-client privilege or work product protection with respect to
5 the assessment and any information contained in the assessment.
6 (6) A single data protection assessment may address a comparable set of processing
7 operations that include similar activities.
8 (7) Data protection assessments conducted by a controller for the purpose of
9 compliance with other laws or regulations may comply under this section if the
10 assessments have a reasonably comparable scope and effect.
11 (8) Data protection assessment requirements shall apply to processing activities created
12 or generated on or after June 1, 2026.
