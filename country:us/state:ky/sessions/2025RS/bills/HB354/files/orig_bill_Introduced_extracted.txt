4 (1) The cabinet shall have four (4) separate and distinct functions in administering this
5 chapter:
6 (a) To approve or deny certificates of need in accordance with the provisions of
7 this chapter, except as to those applications which have been granted
8 nonsubstantive review status by the cabinet;
9 (b) To issue and to revoke certificates of need;
10 (c) To provide a due process hearing and issue a final determination on all actions
11 by the cabinet to deny, revoke, modify, or suspend licenses of health facilities

13 (d) To enforce, through legal actions on its own motion, the provisions of this
14 chapter and its orders and decisions issued pursuant to its functions.

17 Chapter 13A:
18 1. To establish the certificate of need review procedures, including but not
19 limited to, application procedures, notice provisions, procedures for
20 review of completeness of applications, and timetables for review

1 the Commonwealth. The state health plan shall contain a need
2 assessment for long-term care beds, which shall be based on a
3 statistically valid analysis of the present and future needs of the
4 state as a whole and counties individually. The need assessment
5 shall be applied uniformly to all areas of the state. The
6 methodology shall be reviewed and updated on an annual basis.
7 The long-term care bed need criteria in the state health plan or as
8 set forth by the appropriate certificate of need authority shall give
9 preference to conversion of personal care beds and acute care beds
10 to nursing facility beds, so long as the state health plan or the
11 appropriate certificate of need authority establishes a need in the
12 affected counties and the proposed conversions are more cost-
13 effective than new construction. The fact that the state health plan
14 shall not address the specific type of proposal being reviewed shall
15 not constitute grounds for disapproval of the proposal.
16 Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the long-term care
17 bed need criteria in the state health plan or as set forth by the
18 appropriate certificate of need authority shall not consider, factor
19 in, or include any continuing care retirement community's nursing
20 home beds established under KRS 216B.015, 216B.020,
21 216B.330, and 216B.332;
22 b. Need and accessibility. The proposal shall meet an identified need
23 in a defined geographic area and be accessible to all residents of
24 the area. A defined geographic area shall be defined as the area the
25 proposal seeks to serve, including its demographics, and shall not
26 be limited to geographical boundaries;
27 c. Interrelationships and linkages. The proposal shall serve to
Page 2 of 9

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 62
1 accomplish appropriate and effective linkages with other services,
2 facilities, and elements of the health care system in the region and
3 state, accompanied by assurance of effort to achieve
4 comprehensive care, proper utilization of services, and efficient
5 functioning of the health care system;
6 d. Costs, economic feasibility, and resources availability. The
7 proposal, when measured against the cost of alternatives for
8 meeting needs, shall be judged to be an effective and economical
9 use of resources, not only of capital investment, but also ongoing
10 requirements for health manpower and operational financing;
11 e. Quality of services. The applicant shall be prepared to and capable
12 of undertaking and carrying out the responsibilities involved in the
13 proposal in a manner consistent with appropriate standards and
14 requirements assuring the provision of quality health care services,
15 as established by the cabinet; and
16 f. Hospital-based skilled nursing, intermediate care, and personal
17 care beds shall be considered by the cabinet in determining the
18 need for freestanding long-term care beds; and[.]
19 (b) Conduct public hearings, as requested by applicants for or holders of
20 certificates of need and licenses, in respect to certificate-of-need applications,
21 revocations of certificates of need, and denials, suspensions, modifications, or
22 revocations of licenses.
23 (3) The cabinet may:
24 (a) Issue other administrative regulations necessary for the proper administration
25 of this chapter;
26 (b) Administer oaths, issue subpoenas, subpoenas duces tecum, and all necessary
27 process in proceedings brought before or initiated by the cabinet, and the

6 procedures promulgated by administrative regulation. The request shall be filed
7 within fifteen (15) days of the notice of the decision. For purposes of this section

1 date the application is deemed completed[ and shall give notice to all affected
2 persons of the decision to conduct a nonsubstantive review]. Any affected person

6 upon the record established with regard to the matter, the cabinet shall approve or
7 deny a certificate of need on all projects assigned nonsubstantive review status
8 within thirty-five (35) days of the determination of nonsubstantive review status. If
9 the application is denied nonsubstantive review status, it shall automatically be
10 placed in the formal review process.
11 (2) If a certificate of need is denied following a nonsubstantive review, the applicant

13 process. Nothing in this subsection shall require an applicant to pursue a formal
14 review before obtaining judicial review pursuant to KRS 216B.115.

22 (d) For cost escalations; or
23 (e) In other circumstances the cabinet by administrative regulation may prescribe.
24 (4) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary in this chapter, the cabinet may
25 approve a certificate of need for a project required for the purposes set out in
26 subsection (3)(a) to (e) of this section, unless it finds the facility or service with
27 respect to which the capital expenditure is proposed to be made is not required; or

2 expenditure is addressed in the state health plan, the cabinet finds that the capital
3 expenditure is not consistent with the state health plan.
4 (5) The decision of the cabinet approving or denying a certificate of need pursuant to
5 this section shall be final for purposes of judicial appeal, unless the applicant
6 requests the application be placed in the formal review process. An approved
7 certificate shall be issued thirty (30) days after notice of the cabinet's decision,
8 unless a judicial appeal is taken and issuance is enjoined by the court.
9 (6) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the cabinet shall not grant
10 nonsubstantive review status to a certificate of need application that indicates an
11 intent to apply for Medicaid certification of nursing home beds within a continuing
12 care retirement community established under KRS 216B.015, 216B.020, 216B.330,

3 expenditure is not consistent with the state health plan.
4 (5) The decision of the cabinet approving or denying a certificate of need pursuant to
5 this section shall be final for purposes of judicial appeal, unless the applicant

13 (2) An appeal may be taken by filing a petition for review in the Franklin Circuit Court
14 within thirty (30) days after notice of the final decision unless a request for

17 on reconsideration. The petition shall state completely the grounds upon which the
18 review is sought and shall assign all errors relied upon. The petitioner shall serve a
19 copy of the petition to each person who was a party to the proceedings. Summons
20 shall be issued upon the petition directing the adverse party or parties to file an
21 answer within twenty (20) days after service of summons. The cabinet shall, upon
22 being served with the summons and within thirty (30) days thereafter, file a copy of
23 the record, duly certified by the secretary, the cost of the record to be taxed as costs
24 upon appeal. In lieu of filing of the record, an abstract thereof may be filed if all
