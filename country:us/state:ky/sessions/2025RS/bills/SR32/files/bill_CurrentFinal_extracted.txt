2 illnesses in Kentucky.
3 WHEREAS, Kentucky's landscape and scenic outdoors gift us with a beautiful
4 environment to hunt, fish, and hike, yet being in Kentucky's beautiful outdoors may put
5 an individual in contact with several different species of ticks which can carry multiple
6 life-altering diseases and illnesses; and
7 WHEREAS, tick-borne illnesses such as Alpha-gal syndrome (AGS), Rocky
8 Mountain spotted fever, and Lyme disease pose a serious threat to the health and quality
9 of life of many residents of the Commonwealth, and more awareness must be brought to
10 the dangers ticks pose and prevention measures Kentuckians can take to stay healthy; and
11 WHEREAS, AGS is transmitted by the Lone Star tick, which causes an allergy to a
12 sugar molecule found in most nonprimate mammalian meat and byproducts, often
13 referred to as the red meat allergy. The allergy is lifelong, and to avoid the mild to life-
14 threatening anaphylaxis, and gastrointestinal distress caused by the allergy, an infected
15 person must avoid all red meat and dairy products. Not unlike a person infected with
16 other tick-borne illnesses, life-long symptoms of AGS can include headaches, fatigue,
17 severe arthritis with swollen joints, and persistent fatigue for which there is currently no
18 cure; and
19 WHEREAS, early clinical diagnosis and appropriate treatment of these tick-borne
20 diseases and illnesses can greatly reduce the risks of continued, diverse, and chronic
21 symptoms that can affect every system and organ of the human body and impact every
22 aspect of an individual's life; and
23 WHEREAS, a recent national survey of primary care providers in the United States
24 found that 78 percent of providers have little to no knowledge of AGS, and only five
25 percent felt confident in their ability to diagnose or manage patients with AGS. Currently,
26 an AGS-specific antibody test is the only conclusive way to definitively diagnose AGS.

1 preventing lifelong degenerative symptoms; and
2 WHEREAS, tick-borne disease and illness diagnoses increase every year, and with
3 the Lone Star tick's prevalence in Kentucky on the rise, the time has come for Kentucky
4 to focus on these significant and complex diseases, through dissemination of information
5 on prevention and personal protection and raising public awareness of the causes, effects,
6 potential severity, diagnosis challenges, and treatment options of tickborne diseases and
7 illnesses;
8 WHEREAS, residents of Kentucky can greatly reduce their chances of tick bites
9 and pathogen transmission by taking proper precautions while engaged in outdoor
10 activities, making frequent tick checks, and removing and disposing of ticks properly and
11 promptly, and our governmental agencies can educate the public on prevention, detection,
12 and how to be their best advocate if they suspect they have a tick-borne disease or illness;
13 and
14 WHEREAS, no Kentuckian should have to suffer from a preventable tick-borne
15 disease or illness;
16 NOW, THEREFORE,
17 Be it resolved by the Senate of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of
18 Kentucky:
19 Section 1. The members of the Senate join Senator Robin Webb in continuing
20 efforts to benefit the overall health and quality of life of the residents of Kentucky by
21 supporting increased awareness of the threat of tick bites and the seriousness of tick-
22 borne diseases and illnesses.
23 Section 2. The Clerk of the Senate is directed to transmit a copy of this
24 Resolution to the Kentucky Department of Agriculture, the Department of Fish and
25 Wildlife Resources, and the Department for Public Health.
