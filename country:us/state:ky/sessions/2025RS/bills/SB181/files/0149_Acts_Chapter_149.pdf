shall, to the extent possible within existing appropriation amounts, address the additional cost associated with
providing care to children with exceptional needs.
(3) The cabinet shall review reimbursement rates paid to foster parents and shall issue a report upon request
comparing the rates paid by Kentucky to the figures presented in the Expenditures on Children by Families
Annual Report prepared by the United States Department of Agriculture and the rates paid to foster parents by
other states. To the extent that funding is available, reimbursement rates paid to foster parents shall be
increased on an annual basis to reflect cost of living increases.
(4) The cabinet is encouraged to develop pilot projects both within the state system and in collaboration with
private child caring agencies to test alternative delivery systems and nontraditional funding mechanisms.

2. Custodial options selected by the relative and fictive kin caregivers;
3. Services provisioned to relative and fictive kin caregivers and children in their care; and
4. Permanency benchmarks and outcomes for relative and fictive kin caregiver placements.
(b) By September 30, 2020, and annually[upon request] thereafter, the cabinet shall submit a report to the
Governor, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and the director of the Legislative Research
Commission for automatic distribution to the Interim Joint Committee on Families and Children
relating to the data tracking and analysis established in this subsection and post the report to the
cabinet website for public view no later than February 28 of the following year.
(6) Foster parents shall have the authority, unless the cabinet determines that the child's religion, race, ethnicity, or
national origin prevents it, to make decisions regarding haircuts and hairstyles for foster children who are in
their care for thirty (30) days or more.
Signed by Governor April 1, 2025.
