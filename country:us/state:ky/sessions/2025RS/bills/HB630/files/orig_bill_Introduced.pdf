15 Section 5. KRS 262.850 is amended to read as follows:
16 (1) This section shall be known as "the Agricultural District and Conservation Act."
17 (2) It is the policy of the state to conserve, protect, and to encourage development and
18 improvement of its agricultural lands for the production of food and other
19 agricultural products. It is also the policy of this state to conserve and protect the
20 agricultural land base as a valuable natural resource which is both fragile and finite.
21 The pressure imposed by urban expansion, transportation systems, water
22 impoundments, surface mining of mineral resources, utility rights-of-way, and
23 industrial development has continually reduced the land resource base necessary to
24 sufficiently produce food and fiber for our future needs. It is the purpose of this
25 section to provide a means by which agricultural land may be protected and
26 enhanced as a viable segment of the state's economy and as an important resource.

13 information as required in the petition application. The boundary of an agricultural
14 district shall be contiguous. No land shall be included in an agricultural district
15 without the consent of the owner.
16 (5) Upon receipt of a petition, the local conservation district board of supervisors shall
17 notify the fiscal court and any local or regional planning or zoning body, if any, of
18 the proposed agricultural district, and shall notify each city that is located less than
19 one (1) mile from the boundaries of the proposed agricultural district, by sending a
20 copy of the petition and accompanying materials to that body.
21 (6) The following factors shall be considered by the local conservation district board of
22 supervisors and the Soil and Water Conservation Commission when considering the
23 formation of any agricultural district:
24 (a) The capability of the land to support agricultural production, as indicated by[:]
25 soil, climate, topography or other natural factors;
26 (b) The viability of active farmlands, as indicated by[:] markets for farm
27 products, the extent and nature of farm improvements, the present status of

1 farming, and anticipated trends in agricultural economic conditions and
2 technology;
3 (c) That the proposed agricultural district meets the minimum size limit of fifty
4 (50) contiguous acres, unless the local conservation district board and the Soil
5 and Water Conservation Commission allow fewer than fifty (50) contiguous
6 acres if the proposed area meets a minimum annual production performance
7 established by the district board and approved by the commission;
8 (d) County development patterns and needs and the location of the district in
9 relation to any urban development boundaries within the county;
10 (e) Any matter which may be relevant to evaluate the petition; and
11 (f) Whether an application is from more than one (1) farm owner, in which case a
12 preference shall be given to the application.
13 (7) The local soil and water conservation district board of supervisors shall review the
14 petition application and submit a recommendation to the Soil and Water
15 Conservation Commission within one hundred (100) days of receipt. The local
16 conservation district recommendation shall be submitted to the commission in the
17 form of approval, approval with modifications, or denial of the petition
18 accompanied by justification for such a denial.
19 (8) The Soil and Water Conservation Commission shall review the recommendation of
20 the district board of supervisors and certify or deny the agricultural district's
21 petition within one hundred (100) days of receipt.
22 (9) Upon the approval of a petition by the Soil and Water Conservation Commission,
23 the commission shall notify the area development district in which the agricultural
24 district will lie, the local county clerk, the clerk of each city that is located less than

1 (10) Land within the boundary of an agricultural district shall not be annexed.
2 (11) The owners of land within the boundary of an agricultural district shall be exempt
3 under KRS 74.177 from any assessment authorized for the extension of water

7 withdraw his or her property from the district upon notifying the local conservation
8 district board of supervisors in writing. The removal of the property from the
9 agricultural district shall be effective immediately upon the district board of
10 supervisors' receipt of the written notification, at which time the district board of
11 supervisors shall remove the property from the agricultural district and shall
12 immediately provide written notice of the changed boundaries to the those entities
13 listed in subsection (9) of this section.
14 (13) It shall be the policy of all state agencies to support the formation of agricultural
15 districts as a means of preserving Kentucky's farmlands and to mitigate the impact

17 of land within an agricultural district.
18 (14) Agricultural districts shall be comprised only of agricultural land as defined in KRS
19 132.010.
20 (15) An agricultural district shall be established for five (5) years with a review to be

22 end of the five-year period and every five (5) years thereafter. Each owner of land
23 shall agree to remain in the district for a five (5) year period, unless a member
24 elects to withdraw his or her property pursuant to subsection (12) of this section,
25 which is renewable at the end of the five (5) years. However, the board shall make a
26 review any time upon the written request of a local government which demonstrates
27 that the review is necessary in order to consider development needs of the local

1 government. The board shall consider whether the continued existence of the
2 district is justified, any adjustments which may be necessary due to urban or county
3 development, and other factors the board finds relevant. The board shall revise the
4 district as necessary based on the review and subject to approval of the State Soil
5 and Water Conservation Commission. Before the state commission takes final
6 action, all interested parties shall be given the opportunity to request the state
7 commission to amend or overturn the local board's decision.
8 (16) The withdrawal of a member from a district reducing the remaining acreage of
9 agricultural district land to less than fifty (50) acres or resulting in the remaining
10 land being noncontiguous shall not cause the decertification of the district. The
11 local district board of supervisors may consider a dissolution of the agricultural
12 district if the withdrawal results in the remaining property within the agricultural
13 district no longer meeting the definition of agricultural land as defined in KRS
14 132.010.
15 (17) (a) Land within the boundaries of an agricultural district shall not be subject to

23 at which the condemnor shall provide a written report justifying the
24 condemnation of the specific land due to the lack of feasible alternative
25 locations to satisfy the purposes of the project.
26 (c) An action in the condemnation proceeding shall not affect the member's
27 right to a public hearing under this subsection[ However a hearing under

1 this section shall not be held if the petitioner in the condemnation proceeding
2 is a utility as defined in KRS 278.010(3) and obtained a certificate of
3 convenience and necessity as required by KRS 278.020(1)].
4 (18) (a) The board shall notify the local property valuation administrator of the farms
5 which belong to an agricultural district and whenever a farm is withdrawn

8 at the land's agricultural use value and shall offer advice and assistance on
9 obtaining such an assessment.
10 (b) The board shall also notify the local property valuation administrator
11 whenever a farm is released or withdrawn from an agricultural district.
12 (19) The board may allow an amendment to an existing certified agricultural district if

22 statute, and all such rights and powers shall be exercisable as if the conservation
23 easement did not exist].
24 (3) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, an entity authorized to
25 exercise the power of eminent domain shall not take by eminent domain any
26 privately owned property that is subject to a conservation easement, unless the

21 entered. If the court determines that petitioner does not have that[such] right, it
22 shall enter a final judgment which shall contain, in substance:
23 (a) A finding that the report of the commissioners conforms to the
24 requirements[provisions] of KRS 416.580;
25 (b) A finding that the petitioner is not authorized to condemn the property or the
26 use and occupation of the property[thereof] for the purposes and under the
27 conditions and limitations set forth in the petition, stating the particular

1 ground or grounds on which the petitioner is not so authorized;
2 (c) An order dismissing the petition and directing the petitioner to pay all costs,
3 expenses, and reasonable attorney's fees.
4 Section 12. KRS 416.620 is amended to read as follows:
5 (1) Within thirty (30) days from the date of entry of an interlocutory judgment
6 authorizing the petitioner to take possession of the property, exceptions may be
7 filed by either party or both parties by filing with the clerk of the Circuit Court and
8 serving upon the other party or parties a statement of exceptions, which statement
9 shall contain any exceptions the party has to the award made by the commissioners.
10 The statement of exceptions shall be tried, but shall be limited to the questions
11 which are raised in the original statements of the exceptions, or as amended, but the
12 owner shall not be permitted to raise any question, nor shall the court reconsider
13 any question so raised, concerning the right of the petitioner to condemn the
14 property. All questions of fact pertaining to the amount of compensation to the
15 owner, or owners, shall be determined by a jury, which jury on the motion of either
16 party shall be sent by the court, in the charge of the sheriff, to view the land and
17 material. After a jury trial, and if possession previously has not been taken by the
18 condemnor of the land and material condemned, the condemnor[it] may do so upon
19 the payment to the owner or to the clerk of the Circuit Court the amount of the
20 compensation adjudged by the Circuit Court to be due the owner.
21 (2) Appeals may be taken to the Court of Appeals from the final judgment of the
22 Circuit Court as in other cases except that an appeal by the owner shall not operate
23 as a supersedeas.
24 (3) The payment by the condemnor of the amount of compensation awarded and the
25 taking of possession of the lands and material condemned shall not prejudice its
26 right to except from the award of the commissioners or the judgment of any court,
27 nor shall the acceptance by the owner of the amount of the compensation awarded

1 prejudice his or her right to except from the award of the commissioners or the
2 judgment of any court.
3 (4) All costs, expenses, and reasonable attorney's fees in the Circuit Court shall be
4 adjudged against the condemnor.
5 (5) If the condemnor takes possession of the property condemned and the amount of
6 compensation is thereafter increased over that awarded by the commissioners, the
7 condemnor shall pay interest to the owner at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum
8 upon the amount of such increase from the date the condemnor took possession of
9 the property. If the condemnor takes possession of the property condemned and the
10 amount of compensation is thereafter decreased below that awarded by the
11 commissioners, the condemnor shall be entitled to a personal judgment against the
12 owner for the amount of the decrease plus interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per
13 annum from the date the owner accepted the amount of compensation the
14 condemnor paid into court or to the owner. If the owner at all times refuses to
15 accept the payment tendered by the condemnor, no interest shall be allowed in the
16 judgment against the owner for the amount of the decrease.
17 (6) Upon the final determination of exceptions, or upon expiration of thirty (30) days
18 from entry of the interlocutory judgment if no exceptions are filed, the Circuit Court
19 shall make such orders as may be proper for the conveyance of the title to the extent
20 condemned, to the property, and shall enter such final judgment as may be
21 appropriate.
22 Section 13. KRS 416.660 is amended to read as follows:
23 (1) In all actions for the condemnation of lands under the provisions of KRS 416.550 to
24 416.670, except temporary easements, there shall be awarded to the landowners as
25 compensation [such ]a sum that[as] will fairly represent the difference between the
26 fair market value of the entire tract, all or a portion of which is sought to be
27 condemned, immediately before the taking and the fair market value of the
Page 17 of 19

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1841
1 remainder [thereof ]immediately after the taking, including in the remainder all
2 rights which the landowner may retain in the lands sought to be condemned where
3 less than the fee simple interest [therein ]is taken, together with the fair rental value
4 of any temporary easements sought to be condemned.
5 (2) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, the fair market value of
6 property in an eminent domain proceeding shall be the price on the valuation
7 date for the highest and best use of the property that a vendor, willing but not
8 obligated to sell, would accept for the property, and which a purchaser, willing
9 but not obligated to buy, would pay, excluding any increment in value
10 proximately caused by the public project for which the property condemned is
11 needed.
12 (3) The fair market value of property actively used for conservation, farm, or
13 agricultural purposes in an eminent domain proceeding shall be one hundred
14 twenty-five percent (125%) of the highest appraised value of the property.
15 (4) Any change in the fair market value prior to the date of condemnation which the
16 condemnor or condemnee establishes was substantially due to the general
17 knowledge of the imminence of condemnation or the construction of the project
18 shall be disregarded in determining fair market value. The taking date for valuation
19 purposes shall be either the date the condemnor takes the land, or the date of the
20 trial of the issue of just compensation, whichever occurs first.
21 Section 14. KRS 416.675 is amended to read as follows:
22 (1) Every grant of authority contained in the Kentucky Revised Statutes to exercise the
23 power of eminent domain shall be subject to the condition that the authority be
24 exercised only to effectuate a public use of the condemned property.
25 (2) "Public use" shall mean the following:
26 (a) Ownership of the property by the Commonwealth, a political subdivision of
27 the Commonwealth, or other governmental entity;
Page 18 of 19
XXXX 2/16/2025 1:48 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1841
1 (b) The possession, occupation, or enjoyment of the property as a matter of right
2 by the Commonwealth, a political subdivision of the Commonwealth, or other
3 governmental entity;
4 (c) The acquisition and transfer of property for the purpose of eliminating
5 blighted areas, slum areas, or substandard and insanitary areas in accordance
6 with KRS Chapter 99;
7 (d) The use of the property for the creation or operation of public utilities or
8 common carriers; or
9 (e) Other use of the property expressly authorized by statute.
10 (3) (a) No provision in the law of the Commonwealth shall be construed to authorize
11 the condemnation of private property for transfer to a private owner for the
12 purpose of economic development that benefits the general public only
13 indirectly, such as by increasing the tax base, tax revenues, or employment, or
14 by promoting the general economic health of the community.
15 (b) For purposes of this subsection, "private owner" includes public-private
16 partnerships as defined in KRS 65.025, individuals, corporations or other
17 business entities, and nongovernmental entities.
18 (c) [However, ]This subsection[provision] shall not prohibit the sale or lease of
19 property to private entities that occupy an incidental area within a public
20 project or building, provided that no property may be condemned primarily
21 for the purpose of facilitating an incidental private use.
22 (4) The exercise of the power of eminent domain for the acquisition of property
23 financed by state road funds or federal highway funds shall be exempt from the
24 provisions of this section.
