2 Section 2. KRS 337.275 is amended to read as follows:
3 (1) Except as may otherwise be provided by this chapter, every employer shall pay to

5 five cents ($5.85) an hour beginning on June 26, 2007, not less than six dollars and
6 fifty-five cents ($6.55) an hour beginning July 1, 2008, and not less than seven
7 dollars and twenty-five cents ($7.25) an hour beginning July 1, 2009. If the federal
8 minimum hourly wage as prescribed by 29 U.S.C. sec. 206(a)(1) is increased in
9 excess of the minimum hourly wage in effect under this subsection, the minimum
10 hourly wage under this subsection shall be increased to the same amount, effective
11 on the same date as the federal minimum hourly wage rate. If the state minimum
12 hourly wage is increased to the federal minimum hourly wage, it shall include only
13 the federal minimum hourly rate prescribed in 29 U.S.C. sec. 206(a)(1) and shall
14 not include other wage rates or conditions, exclusions, or exceptions to the federal
15 minimum hourly wage rate. In addition, the increase to the federal minimum hourly
16 wage rate does not extend or modify the scope or coverage of the minimum wage
17 rate required under this chapter.
18 (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1) of this section, for any employee
19 engaged in an occupation in which he or she customarily and regularly receives

21 employer may pay as a minimum not less than the hourly wage rate required to be
22 paid a tipped employee under the federal minimum hourly wage law as prescribed
23 by 29 U.S.C. sec. 203. The employer shall establish by his or her records that for
24 each week where credit is taken, when adding tips received to wages paid, not less
25 than the minimum rate prescribed in 29 U.S.C. sec. 203 was received by the
26 employee. No employer shall use all or part of any tips or gratuities received by
27 employees toward the payment of the statutory minimum hourly wage as required

1 by 29 U.S.C. sec. 203. Nothing, however, shall prevent employees from entering
2 into an agreement to divide tips or gratuities among themselves.
3 (3) (a) Notwithstanding subsections (1) and (2) of this section, when a state of
4 emergency is declared by the Governor of Kentucky resulting in the
5 designation of essential employees, every employer with a gross revenue of
6 at least one billion dollars ($1,000,000,000) shall pay to each employee
7 deemed an essential employee an hourly hazard wage rate not less than
8 fifteen dollars ($15) per hour for forty (40) hours of working time in any
9 week and one and a half (1-1/2) times that essential employee's regular
10 hourly wage for each hour of working time in excess of forty (40) hours in
11 any week. On and after the effective date of this Act, the overtime rate
12 established by this subsection shall not apply to any individual employed in
13 a bona fide executive or professional capacity.
14 (b) The hazard wage rate established by this subsection shall match the
15 percentage increase of the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers,
16 U.S. city average, not seasonally adjusted, as calculated by the United States
17 Department of Labor for the twelve (12) months preceding the previous
18 September 1.
19 (c) If the regular wage of a qualifying essential employee in the
20 Commonwealth or federal prevailing wage for government contractors in
21 the same class or function area is higher than the hazard wage established
22 by this subsection, the worker shall be paid at the higher rate.
23 (d) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to entitle an essential
24 employee to both his or her regular wage and the hazard wage triggered by
25 the declaration of an emergency.
