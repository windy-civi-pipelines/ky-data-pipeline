(1) There is hereby created and established a Council on Postsecondary Education in Kentucky as an agency,
instrumentality, and political subdivision of the Commonwealth and a public body corporate and politic having
all powers, duties, and responsibilities as are provided to it by law, appointed for a term set by law pursuant to
Section 23 of the Constitution of Kentucky. The council shall be composed of the commissioner of education,
a faculty member, a student member, and thirteen (13) citizen members appointed by the Governor. The
citizen members shall be confirmed by the Senate under KRS 11.160, and the commissioner of education shall
serve as a nonvoting ex officio member. Citizen council members shall be selected from a list of nominees
provided to the Governor under the nominating process set forth in KRS 164.005. If the General Assembly is

number of minority members, it shall be rounded up to the next whole number. A particular political affiliation
shall not be a prerequisite to appointment to the council generally; however, if any person is appointed to the
council that does not represent either of the two (2) leading political parties of the Commonwealth, the
proportional representation by political affiliation requirement shall be determined and satisfied based on the
total number of members on the council less any members not affiliated with either of the two (2) leading
political parties. In filling vacancies to the council, the Governor shall act so as to provide, inasmuch as
possible, equal representation of the two (2) sexes by appointing a member of the sex that is the lesser

(3) nominees selected and submitted by majority vote of the ten (10) faculty members who serve as faculty
representatives of the boards of trustees and boards of regents of the nine (9) postsecondary education

Kentucky Community and Technical College System, and one (1) student body president representing the
members of the Association of Independent Kentucky Colleges and Universities shall elect by majority vote
three (3) nominees to submit to the Governor. From this list of nominees, the Governor shall appoint a student
member.
(5) In filling any vacancies, the Governor shall ensure the continuing representation upon the council of the broad
constituencies as set forth in subsection (2) of this section. Vacancies on the council shall be filled for the
