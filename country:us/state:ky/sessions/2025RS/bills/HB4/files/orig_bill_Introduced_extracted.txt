21 the fifty (50) United States shall become immediately ineligible to serve.
22 The Council on Postsecondary Education shall notify the appointee of
23 his or her ineligibility to serve.

4 (2) The terms of appointed members shall be for six (6) years and until their successors
5 are appointed and qualified, unless a member is removed by the Governor pursuant

8 after the date of appointment shall not affect a member's ability to serve nor shall it
9 prevent a member's eligibility for reappointment, except a member who assumes
10 residency outside the fifty (50) United States shall become immediately ineligible
11 to serve. The Council on Postsecondary Education shall notify the appointee of his
12 or her ineligibility to serve.
