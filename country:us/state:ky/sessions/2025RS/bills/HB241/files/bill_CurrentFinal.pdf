1 These administrative regulations shall include procedures for a superintendent
2 to request an exemption from the Kentucky Board of Education when unusual
3 circumstances warrant an increased class size for an individual class. A
4 request for an exemption shall include specific reasons for the increased class
5 size with a plan for reducing the class size prior to the beginning of the next
6 school year. A district shall not receive in any one (1) year exemptions for
7 more classes than enroll twenty percent (20%) of the pupils in the primary
8 grades and grades four (4) through eight (8).
9 (d) In all schools the commissioner of education shall enforce the special
10 education maximum class sizes set by administrative regulations adopted by
11 the Kentucky Board of Education. A superintendent may request an
12 exemption pursuant to paragraph (c) of this subsection. A local school council
13 may request a waiver pursuant to KRS 156.160(2). An exemption or waiver
14 shall not be granted if the increased class size will impede any exceptional
15 child from achieving his or her individual education program in the least
16 restrictive environment.
17 (6) In grades four (4) through six (6) with combined grades, the maximum class size
18 shall be the average daily attendance upon which funding is appropriated for the
19 lowest assigned grade in the class. There shall be no exceptions to the maximum
20 class size for combined classes. In combined classes other than the primary grades,
21 no ungraded students shall be placed in a combined class with graded students. In
22 addition, there shall be no more than two (2) consecutive grade levels combined in
23 any one (1) class in grades four (4) through six (6). However, this shall not apply to
24 schools which have implemented school-based decision making.

26 that an appropriate program in the least restrictive environment for a particular child
27 with a disability includes either part-time or full-time enrollment with a private

1 school or agency within the state or a public or private agency in another state, the
2 school district shall count as average daily attendance in a public school the time
3 that the child is in attendance at the school or agency, contingent upon approval by
4 the commissioner of education.
5 (8) Pupils attending a center for child learning and study established under an
6 agreement pursuant to KRS 65.210 to 65.300 shall, for the purpose of calculating
7 average daily attendance, be considered as in attendance in the school district in
8 which the child legally resides and which is party to the agreement. For purposes of
9 subsection (1) of this section, teachers who are actually employees of the joint or
10 cooperative action shall be considered as employees of each school district which is
11 a party to the agreement.
12 (9) Program funding shall be increased when the average daily attendance in any
13 district for the first two (2) months of the current school year is greater than the
14 average daily attendance of the district for the first two (2) months of the previous
15 school year. The program funds allotted the district shall be increased by the
16 percent of increase. The average daily attendance in kindergarten is the
17 kindergarten full-time equivalent pupils in average daily attendance.
18 (10) If the average daily attendance for the current school year in any district decreases
19 by ten percent (10%) or more than the average daily attendance for the previous
20 school year, the average daily attendance for purposes of calculating program
21 funding for the next school year shall be increased by an amount equal to two-thirds
22 (2/3) of the decrease in average daily attendance. If the average daily attendance
23 remains the same or decreases in the succeeding school year, the average daily
24 attendance for purposes of calculating program funding for the following school
25 year shall be increased by an amount equal to one-third (1/3) of the decrease for the
26 first year of the decline.
27 (11) If the percentage of attendance of any school district shall have been reduced more

1 than two percent (2%) during the previous school year, the program funding
2 allotted the district for the current school year shall be increased by the difference in
3 the percentage of attendance for the two (2) years immediately prior to the current
4 school year less two percent (2%).
5 (12) (a) Instructional salaries for vocational agriculture classes shall be for twelve (12)
6 months per year. Vocational agriculture teachers shall be responsible for the
7 following program of instruction during the time period beyond the regular
8 school term established by the local board of education: supervision and
9 instruction of students in agriculture experience programs; group and
10 individual instruction of farmers and agribusinessmen; supervision of student
11 members of agricultural organizations who are involved in leadership training
12 or other activity required by state or federal law; or any program of vocational
13 agriculture established by the Department of Education. During extended
14 employment, no vocational agriculture teacher shall receive salary on a day
15 that the teacher is scheduled to attend an institution of higher education class
16 which could be credited toward meeting any certification requirement.
17 (b) Each teacher of agriculture employed shall submit an annual plan for summer
18 program to the local school superintendent for approval. The summer plan
19 shall include a list of tasks to be performed, purposes for each task, and time
20 to be spent on each task. Approval by the local school superintendent shall be
21 in compliance with the guidelines developed by the Department of Education.
22 The supervision and accountability of teachers of vocational agriculture's
23 summer programs shall be the responsibility of the local school

6 properly identified according to Kentucky Board of Education administrative
7 regulations. Attendance shall be calculated pursuant to KRS 157.270 and shall
8 be reported monthly on forms provided by the Department of Education; and
9 (b) Pursuant to administrative regulations of the Kentucky Board of Education,
10 local school districts shall be reimbursed for home and hospital instruction for
11 pupils unable to attend regular school sessions because of short-term health
12 impairments. A reimbursement formula shall be established by administrative
13 regulations to include such factors as a reasonable per hour, per child
14 allotment for teacher instructional time, with a maximum number of funded
15 hours per week, a reasonable allotment for teaching supplies and equipment,
16 and a reasonable allotment for travel expenses to and from instructional
17 assignments, but the formula shall not include an allotment for capital outlay.
18 Attendance shall be calculated pursuant to KRS 157.270 and shall be reported
19 annually on forms provided by the Department of Education.

1 (16) During a fiscal year, a school district may request that the Department of Education
2 recalculate its funds allocated under this section if the current year average daily
3 attendance for the twenty (20) day school month as defined in KRS 158.060(1) that
4 contains the most days within the calendar month of January exceeds the prior year
5 adjusted average daily attendance plus growth by at least one percent (1%). Any
6 adjustments in the allotments approved under this subsection shall be proportional
7 to the remaining days in the school year and subject to available funds under the
8 program to support education excellence in Kentucky.
9 (17) To calculate the state portion of the program to support education excellence in
10 Kentucky for a school district, the Department of Education shall subtract the local
11 effort required under KRS 157.390(5) from the calculated base funding under the
12 program to support education excellence in Kentucky, as required by this section.
13 The value of the real estate used in this calculation shall be the lesser of the current
14 year assessment or the prior year assessment increased by four percent (4%) plus
15 the value of current year new property. The calculation under this subsection shall
16 be subject to available funds.
17 (18) Notwithstanding any other statute or budget of the Commonwealth language to the
18 contrary, time missed due to shortening days for emergencies may be made up by
19 lengthening school days in the school calendar without any loss of funds under the
20 program to support education excellence in Kentucky.
21 Section 4. KRS 158.120 is amended to read as follows:
22 (1) [By July 1, 2022, ]A board of education shall adopt a nonresident pupil policy to
23 govern the terms under which the district shall allow enrollment of nonresident
24 pupils. Upon allowing nonresident pupil enrollment, the policy shall allow
25 nonresident children to be eligible to enroll in any public school located within the
26 district. The policy shall not discriminate between nonresident pupils, but may
27 recognize enrollment capacity, as determined by the local school district. The

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS HB 241/EN
1 nonresident pupil policy and any subsequent changes adopted by a board of
2 education shall be filed with the Kentucky Department of Education no later than
3 thirty (30) days following their adoption.
4 (2) Any board of education may charge a reasonable tuition fee per month for each
5 child attending its schools whose parent, guardian, or other legal custodian is not a
6 bona fide resident of the district. Any controversy as to the fee shall be submitted to
7 the Kentucky Board of Education for final settlement. The fee shall be paid by the
8 board of education of the school district in which the pupil resides, except in cases
9 where the board makes provision for the child's education within his or her district.
10 If a board of education is required to pay a pupil's tuition fee, the pupil shall be
11 admitted to a school only upon proper certificate of the board of education of the
12 district in which he or she resides.
13 (3) When it appears to the board of education of any school district that it is convenient
14 for a pupil of any grade residing in that district to attend an approved public school
15 in another district, the board of education may enter into a tuition contract with the
16 public school authorities of the other school district for that purpose, but before a
17 contract is entered into with public school authorities in another state the school
18 shall have been approved by the state school authorities of that state through the
19 grades in which the pupil belongs. When a district undertakes, under operation of a
20 tuition contract or of law, to provide in its school for pupils residing in another
21 district, the district of their residence shall share the total cost of the school,
22 including transportation when furnished at public expense, in proportion to the
23 number of pupils or in accordance with contract agreement between the two (2)
24 boards.
25 (4) As used in this subsection, "virtual program" has the same meaning as in
26 Section 2 of this Act. A school district may enroll nonresident pupils on a full-
27 time basis in kindergarten through grade twelve (12) in a virtual program

1 established under Section 5 of this Act by that district. Nonresident pupil
2 enrollment shall be subject to the following requirements:
3 (a) Beginning with the 2025-2026 school year, the statewide total enrollment of
4 nonresident pupils in virtual programs offered by school districts shall not
5 exceed an enrollment cap of one percent (1%) of the previous year's total
6 statewide student enrollment in all school districts. By July 1, 2025, and
7 each year thereafter until June 30, 2028, the Kentucky Department of
8 Education shall publish on its website the previous year's total statewide
9 student enrollment in all school districts and the one percent (1%) value of
10 that number. The information shall remain on the website for the
11 remainder of each school year;
12 (b) Each school district shall report in the student information system the
13 nonresident pupils enrolled in the district's virtual programs. The
14 department shall monitor the number of statewide total enrollment of
15 nonresident pupils in virtual programs;
16 (c) If the number of statewide total enrollment of nonresident pupils in virtual
17 programs reaches eighty-five hundredths of one percent (0.85%) of the
18 previous year's total statewide student enrollment in all school districts, the
19 department shall alert all school districts operating virtual programs that
20 the nonresident enrollment cap has almost been reached. Upon receiving
21 the alert, a school district shall notify any nonresident pupil seeking
22 enrollment in a virtual program operated by the school district that the pupil
23 will be provisionally enrolled until the department can confirm that the
24 pupil's enrollment would not exceed the enrollment cap, and shall report
25 the pupil as provisionally enrolled in the student information system. If the
26 department determines that a pupil's enrollment would exceed the

12 total enrollment of nonresident pupils in virtual programs falls back below
13 the enrollment cap, the department shall notify all school districts operating
14 virtual programs that nonresident enrollment may resume again, but any
