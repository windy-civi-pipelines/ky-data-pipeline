4 the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, or his or her designee, prior to the
5 expiration of the ninety (90) day period or upon satisfactory completion of ninety
6 (90) days of treatment, the person shall be deemed finally discharged from
7 sentence. The secretary, or his or her designee, shall notify the sentencing court of

12 initially ordered.

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 956
1 others for services rendered by the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, unless
2 the person and the treatment or recovery program shall arrange otherwise.
3 (7) None of the provisions of this section shall be deemed to preclude the court from
4 exercising its usual discretion with regard to ordering probation, presumptive
5 probation, or conditional discharge.
6 (8) In the case of any person who has been convicted of unlawful possession of
7 marijuana, synthetic drugs, or salvia, the court may set aside and void the
8 conviction upon satisfactory completion of treatment, probation, or other sentence,
9 and issue to the person a certificate to that effect. A conviction voided under this
10 subsection shall not be deemed a first offense for purposes of this chapter or
11 deemed a conviction for purposes of disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law
12 upon conviction of a crime.
13 (9) If the court voids a conviction under this section, the court shall order the sealing of
14 all records in the custody of the court and any records in the custody of any other
15 agency or official, including law enforcement records, except as provided in KRS
16 27A.099. The court shall order the sealing on a form provided by the

19 seal records, shall certify to the court within sixty (60) days of the entry of the order
20 that the required sealing action has been completed.
21 (10) After the sealing of the record, the proceedings in the matter shall not be used
22 against the defendant. The court and other agencies shall reply to any inquiry that
23 no record exists on the matter. The person whose record is sealed shall not have to
24 disclose the fact of the record or any matter relating thereto on an application for
25 employment, credit, or other type of application.
26 (11) Inspection of the sealed records may thereafter be permitted by the court or upon a
27 motion by the person who is the subject of the records and only to those persons
