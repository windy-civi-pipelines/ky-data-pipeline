21 (b) Additional time worked by a classified school employee shall be considered

15 scheduled hours in the school work day and receive credit towards the
16 four (4) day professional development requirement within the minimum
17 one hundred eighty-five (185) days that a teacher shall be employed.
18 2. A flexible schedule option shall be reflected in the school's professional
19 development component within the school improvement plan and

25 unless the activity is related to the teacher's classroom assignment and
26 content area, or the administrator's job requirements, or is required by
27 the school improvement plan, or is tied to the teacher's or the

19 approved by the Kentucky Board of Education upon recommendation of

Page 7 of 11

4 schools shall not be limited to the minimum school term in providing this
5 education. Continuing education time may include extended days, extended weeks,

15 pupils who are identified as needing additional time to achieve the outcomes
16 defined in KRS 158.6451. A school district that has a school operating a model

19 instruction to qualified students outside of the regular classroom during the student
20 attendance day.
21 (8) Notwithstanding any other statute, each school term shall include no less than the
22 equivalent of the student instructional year in subsection (1)(f) of this section, or a
23 variable student instructional year in subsection (1)(h) of this section, except that
24 the commissioner of education may grant up to the equivalent of ten (10) student
25 attendance days for school districts that have a nontraditional instruction plan

Page 8 of 11

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 25
1 nontraditional instruction process shall be a continuation of learning that is
2 occurring on regular student attendance days. Instructional delivery methods,
3 including the use of technology, shall be clearly delineated in the plan. Average
4 daily attendance for purposes of Support Education Excellence in Kentucky
5 program funding during the student attendance days granted shall be calculated in
6 compliance with administrative regulations promulgated by the Kentucky Board of
7 Education.
8 (9) The Kentucky Board of Education shall promulgate administrative regulations to

17 shall include clear evidence of learning continuation;
18 (c) Timelines for initial approval as a nontraditional instruction district, length of
19 approval, the renewal process, and ongoing evaluative procedures required of

Page 9 of 11

2 Federal School Breakfast Program may also authorize up to fifteen (15) minutes of
3 the student attendance day to provide the opportunity for children to eat breakfast
4 during instructional time.
5 (11) Notwithstanding any other statute to the contrary, the following provisions shall
6 apply to a school district that misses student attendance days due to emergencies,
7 including weather-related emergencies:
8 (a) A certified school employee shall be considered to have fulfilled the
9 minimum one hundred eighty-five (185) day contract with a school district
10 under KRS 157.350 and shall be given credit for the purpose of calculating
11 service credit for retirement under KRS 161.500 for certified school personnel
12 if:
13 1. State and local requirements under this section are met regarding the
14 equivalent of the number and length of student attendance days, teacher
15 professional days, professional development days, holidays, and days
16 for planning activities without the presence of students; and

18 attendance days missed due to any emergency, as approved by the
19 Kentucky Department of Education when required, including but not
20 limited to a provision for additional instructional time per day, are met.
21 (b) Additional time worked by a classified school employee shall be considered
22 as equivalent time to be applied toward the employee's contract and
23 calculation of service credit for classified employees under KRS 78.615 if:

25 approved by the Kentucky Department of Education that contains a
26 provision that additional instructional time per day shall be used to make
27 up full days missed due to an emergency;
Page 10 of 11

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 25
1 2. The employee's contract requires a minimum six (6) hour work day; and
2 3. The employee's job responsibilities and work day are extended when the
3 instructional time is extended for the purposes of making up time.
4 (c) Classified employees who are regularly scheduled to work less than six (6)
5 hours per day and who do not have additional work responsibilities as a result
6 of lengthened student attendance days shall be excluded from the provisions
7 of this subsection. These employees may be assigned additional work
8 responsibilities to make up service credit under KRS 78.615 that would be
9 lost due to lengthened student attendance days.
