9 (20) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the bid for proposals for health
10 insurance coverage for calendar year 2004 shall include a bid scenario that reflects

10 required under 42 U.S.C. sec. 1396a(a)(10), as amended, and described in 42 U.S.C.
11 sec. 1396d(a)(4)(B), as amended.
12 Section 2. KRS 205.6497 is amended to read as follows:
13 (1) As permitted by federal law, in any plan submitted for federal Title XXI approval
14 of a children's health insurance program for Kentucky, the cabinet shall include

1 IS CREATED TO READ AS FOLLOWS:
2 (1) As used in this section, "health plan":
3 (a) Means any health insurance policy, certificate, contract, or plan that offers
4 or provides coverage in this state for a well-child visit, including well-baby
5 visits, whether such coverage is:
6 1. By direct payment, reimbursement, or otherwise; and
7 2. On a fully insured or self-insured basis or any combination thereof;
8 and
9 (b) Includes but is not limited to a health benefit plan.
10 (2) Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, coverage under a health plan
11 for a well-child visit, including a well-baby visit, shall include coverage for
12 perinatal mood and anxiety disorders screenings for any accompanying parent or
13 legal guardian of a covered child that is less than two (2) years of age.
14 (3) Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, the coverage required by this
15 section shall not be subject to cost sharing.
16 (4) If the application of any requirement of this section would be the sole cause of a
17 health plan's failure to qualify as a Health Savings Account-qualified High
18 Deductible Health Plan under 26 U.S.C. sec. 223, as amended, then the
19 requirement shall not apply to that health plan until the minimum deductible
20 under 26 U.S.C. sec. 223, as amended, is satisfied.
21 (5) Notwithstanding KRS 304.17A-099 and any other provision of this chapter, if the
22 application of any requirement of this section to a qualified health plan, as
23 defined in 42 U.S.C. sec. 18021(a)(1), as amended, results, or would result, in a
24 determination that the state must make payments to defray the cost of the
25 requirement under 42 U.S.C. sec. 18031(d)(3) and 45 C.F.R. sec. 155.170, as
26 amended, then the requirement shall not apply to the qualified health plan until
27 the requirement to make cost defrayal payments is no longer applicable.

6 (3) The premiums may be paid by the policyholder:

19 she has elected coverage, into either the service area of another managed health care
20 plan or into an area of the Commonwealth not within a managed health care plan
21 service area, the employee shall be given an option, at the time of the move or
22 transfer, to change his or her coverage to another health benefit plan.
23 (5) No payment of premium by any department, board, agency, public postsecondary
24 educational institution, or branch of state, city, urban-county, charter county,
25 county, or consolidated local government shall constitute compensation to an
26 insured employee for the purposes of any statute fixing or limiting the
