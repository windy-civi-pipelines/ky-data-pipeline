2 (9) (a) The requirements of subsections (2), (3), and (4) of this section shall not apply
3 when, in the best medical judgment of the physician based on the facts of the
4 case before him or her, a medical emergency exists that so complicates the
5 pregnancy as to require an immediate abortion.
6 (b) If a medical emergency exists, the physician shall make reasonable attempts,
7 whenever possible, and without endangering the minor, to contact the parent
8 or legal guardian of the minor, and may proceed, but must document reasons
9 for the medical necessity in the minor's medical records.
10 (c) The physician shall inform the parent or legal guardian, in person or by
11 telephone, within twenty-four (24) hours of the abortion, including details of
12 the medical emergency that necessitated the abortion without the parent's or
13 legal guardian's consent. The physician shall also provide this information in
14 writing to the parent or legal guardian at his or her last known address by
15 first-class mail or by certified mail, return receipt requested, with delivery
16 restricted to the parent or legal guardian.
17 (10) A report indicating the basis for any medical judgment that warrants failure to
18 obtain consent pursuant to this section shall be filed with the Cabinet for Health and
19 Family Services on a form supplied by the cabinet. This report shall be confidential.
20 (11) Failure to obtain consent pursuant to the requirements of this section is prima facie
21 evidence of failure to obtain informed consent and of interference with family
22 relations in appropriate civil actions. The law of this state shall not be construed to
23 preclude the award of exemplary damages in any appropriate civil action relevant to
24 violations of this section. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the
25 common-law rights of parents.
26 (12) A minor upon whom an abortion is performed is not guilty of violating this section.

9 (b) The requirements of this section shall not apply when, in the medical
10 judgment of the attending physician based on the particular facts of the case
11 before the physician[him], there exists a medical emergency. In such a case,

13 an emergency exists on a form prescribed by the cabinet as required by KRS
14 213.101, and the physician or his or her agent shall notify, if reasonably
15 possible, the spouse of the woman upon whom the abortion was performed,
16 within thirty (30) days of the abortion.
17 (c) The requirements of this section shall not apply when the abortion is
18 performed or induced:
19 1. To remove a dead unborn fetus;
20 2. To remove an ectopic pregnancy or incomplete miscarriage;
21 3. Due to a lethal fetal anomaly or the fetus is incompatible with
22 sustained life outside of the womb; or
23 4. By a physician with the good-faith belief that the pregnancy is the
24 result of rape under KRS 510.040, 510.050, or 510.060, or incest
25 under KRS 530.020, and the fetus has not reached viability.
26 (3) Failure to notify a spouse as required by this section is prima facie evidence of
27 interference with family relations in appropriate civil actions. The law of this

23 determination made by another physician and certifies in writing, based on the

11 substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function of the
12 pregnant woman;
13 2. A different physician not professionally related to the physician
14 described in subparagraph 1. of this paragraph certifies in writing that,

22 care facility that has appropriate neonatal services for premature infants
23 unless the abortion is performed in accordance with subsection (2)(c)
24 or (d) of this section;
25 4. The physician who intentionally performs or induces or intentionally
26 attempts to perform or induce the abortion terminates or attempts to

2 physician's good-faith[reasonable] medical judgment, based on the facts
3 known to the physician at that time, that the termination of the
4 pregnancy in that manner poses a greater risk of death of the pregnant
5 woman or a greater risk of the substantial and irreversible impairment of

10 considered and the reasons for choosing the method or technique
11 employed; and
