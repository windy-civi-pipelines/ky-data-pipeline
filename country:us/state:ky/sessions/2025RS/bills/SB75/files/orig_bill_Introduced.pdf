1 licensed family child-care home as defined in KRS 199.8982, or a health-care
2 facility licensed under KRS Chapter 216B, except facilities renting or leasing
3 housing, may prohibit persons holding concealed deadly weapon licenses from
4 carrying concealed deadly weapons on the premises and may prohibit employees,
5 not authorized by the employer, holding concealed deadly weapons licenses from

7 or the premises are open to the public, the employer or business enterprise shall
8 post signs on or about the premises if carrying concealed weapons is prohibited.
9 Possession of weapons,[ or] ammunition, or both in a vehicle on the premises shall
10 not be a criminal offense so long as the weapons,[ or] ammunition, or both are not
11 removed from the vehicle or brandished while the vehicle is on the premises. A
12 private but not a public employer may prohibit employees or other persons holding
13 a concealed deadly weapons license from carrying concealed deadly weapons,[ or]

25 employer.
26 (18) All moneys collected by the Department of Kentucky State Police pursuant to this

1 to 237.142. By March 1 of each year, the Department of Kentucky State Police and
2 the Administrative Office of the Courts shall submit reports to the Governor, the
3 President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, indicating
4 the amounts of money collected and the expenditures related to this section, KRS
5 237.138 to 237.142, and KRS 237.115, 244.125, 527.020, and 527.070, and the
6 administration of the provisions of this section, KRS 237.138 to 237.142, and KRS
7 237.115, 244.125, 527.020, and 527.070.
8 (19) The General Assembly finds as a matter of public policy that it is necessary to
9 provide statewide uniform standards for issuing licenses to carry concealed firearms
10 and to occupy the field of regulation of the bearing of concealed firearms to ensure
11 that no person who qualifies under the provisions of this section is denied his or her
12 rights. The General Assembly does not delegate to the Department of Kentucky
13 State Police the authority to regulate or restrict the issuing of licenses provided for
14 in this section beyond those provisions contained in this section. This section shall
15 be liberally construed to carry out the constitutional right to bear arms for self-
16 defense.
17 (20) (a) A person who is not a resident of Kentucky and who has a valid license issued
18 by another state of the United States to carry a concealed deadly weapon in
19 that state may, subject to provisions of Kentucky law, carry a concealed
20 deadly weapon in Kentucky, and his or her license shall be considered as valid
21 in Kentucky.
22 (b) If a person with a valid license to carry a concealed deadly weapon issued
23 from another state that has entered into a reciprocity agreement with the
24 Department of Kentucky State Police becomes a resident of Kentucky, the
25 license issued by the other state shall be considered as valid for the first one
26 hundred twenty (120) days of the person's residence in Kentucky, if within
27 sixty (60) days of moving to Kentucky, the person completes a form

4 knowledge the person's license to carry a concealed deadly weapon is
5 valid and in compliance with applicable out-of-state law, and has not
6 been revoked or suspended for any reason except for valid forfeiture due
7 to departure from the issuing state;
8 2. The person's name, date of birth, citizenship, gender, Social Security
9 number if applicable, proof that he or she is a citizen of the United
10 States, a permanent resident of the United States, or otherwise lawfully

12 within the state of Kentucky, date on which Kentucky residence began,
13 state which issued the concealed carry license, the issuing state's
14 concealed carry license number, and the state of issuance of the license;

1 (e) The Department of Kentucky State Police shall,[ not later than thirty (30) days
2 after July 15, 1998, and] not less than once every twelve (12) months[
3 thereafter], make written inquiry of the concealed deadly weapon carrying
4 licensing authorities in each other state as to whether a Kentucky resident may
5 carry a concealed deadly weapon in their state based upon having a valid
6 Kentucky concealed deadly weapon license, or whether a Kentucky resident
7 may apply for a concealed deadly weapon carrying license in that state based
8 upon having a valid Kentucky concealed deadly weapon license. The
9 Department of Kentucky State Police shall attempt to secure from each other
10 state permission for Kentucky residents who hold a valid Kentucky concealed
11 deadly weapon license to carry concealed deadly weapons in that state, either
12 on the basis of the Kentucky license or on the basis that the Kentucky license
13 is sufficient to permit the issuance of a similar license by the other state. The
14 Department of Kentucky State Police shall enter into a written reciprocity
15 agreement with the appropriate agency in each state that agrees to permit
16 Kentucky residents to carry concealed deadly weapons in the other state on
17 the basis of a Kentucky-issued concealed deadly weapon license or that will
18 issue a license to carry concealed deadly weapons in the other state based
19 upon a Kentucky concealed deadly weapon license. If a reciprocity agreement
20 is reached, the requirement to recontact the other state each twelve (12)
21 months shall be eliminated as long as the reciprocity agreement is in force.
22 The information shall be a public record and shall be available to individual
23 requesters free of charge for the first copy and at the normal rate for open
24 records requests for additional copies.
25 (21) By March 1 of each year, the Department of Kentucky State Police shall submit a
26 statistical report to the Governor, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the
27 House of Representatives, indicating the number of licenses issued, revoked,

18 (c) The department shall not require prior notification that an applicant class or
19 instructor class will be conducted by a certified instructor or instructor trainer;
