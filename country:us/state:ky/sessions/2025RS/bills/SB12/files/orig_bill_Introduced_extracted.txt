9 (17) If a state employee's residence and place of employment are in the same county,
10 and if the hospital located within that county does not offer surgical services,

1 insurance coverage for calendar year 2004 shall include a bid scenario that reflects

20 other requirements or criteria in the request for proposal.

3 the applicable limitations on his or her cost sharing pursuant to this section for a
4 prescription drug.
