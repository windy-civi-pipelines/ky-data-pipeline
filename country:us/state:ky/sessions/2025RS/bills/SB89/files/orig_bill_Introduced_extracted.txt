1 operations are completed.
2 (11) (a) A basic fee set by administrative regulation, and bearing a reasonable
3 relationship to the cost of processing the permit application but not to exceed
4 two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500), plus a fee set by administrative
5 regulation but not to exceed seventy-five dollars ($75), for each acre or
6 fraction thereof of the area of land to be affected by the operation, shall be
7 paid before the permit required in this section shall be issued; provided that if
8 the cabinet approves an incremental bonding plan submitted by the applicant,
9 the acreage fees may be paid in increments and at times corresponding to the

11 (b) The applicant shall file with the cabinet a bond payable to the Commonwealth
12 of Kentucky with surety satisfactory to the cabinet in the sum to be
13 determined by the cabinet for each acre or fraction thereof of the area of land
14 affected, with a minimum bond of ten thousand dollars ($10,000), conditioned
15 upon the faithful performance of the requirements set forth in this chapter and
16 of the administrative regulations of the cabinet. The cabinet shall forfeit the
17 entire amount of the bond for the permit area or increment in the event of
18 forfeiture.
19 (c) In determining the amount of the bond, the cabinet shall take into
20 consideration the:
21 1. Character and nature of the overburden;
22 2. [the ]Future suitable use of the land involved;
23 3. [the ]Cost of backfilling, grading, and reclamation to be required; and
24 4. [the ]Probable difficulty of reclamation, giving consideration to such
25 factors as topography, geology, hydrology, and revegetation potential.
26 (d) The bond amount shall initially be computed to be sufficient to ensure
27 completion of reclamation if the work had to be performed by the cabinet in
Page 25 of 29
BR126400.100 - 1264 - XXXX 2/14/2025 10:36 AM Jacketed

1 the event of forfeiture.
2 (e) For any permit or permit increment identified by the cabinet as requiring
3 long-term treatment, the cabinet shall calculate an additional bond or other
4 financial assurance instrument amount based on the estimated annual
5 treatment cost, provided by the permittee and verified by the cabinet,
6 multiplied by a factor of twenty-five (25), plus any capital cost of the
7 treatment system. The cabinet shall use its own estimate for annual
8 treatment costs if the cabinet cannot verify the permittee's estimate.
9 (f) Within thirty (30) days of a cabinet determination of a need to change a bond
10 protocol currently in use, the cabinet shall immediately promulgate
11 administrative regulations setting forth bonding requirements, including but
12 not limited to requirements for the amount, duration, release, and forfeiture of
13 bonds. Bond protocols shall not be exempt from KRS 13A.100 and shall be
14 established by promulgating administrative regulations under KRS Chapter
15 13A. Failure to include the formula for establishing the amount of the bond in
16 any administrative regulation on bonding requirements shall be deemed a
17 failure to comply with the prescriptions of this section and the administrative
18 regulation shall automatically be declared deficient in accordance with KRS
19 Chapter 13A.
20 (12) The cabinet shall promulgate administrative regulations for the permitting of
21 operations with surface effects of underground mining and other surface coal
22 mining and reclamation operations consistent with this section. The cabinet shall
23 recognize the distinct differences between the surface effects of underground
24 mining and strip mining, as also provided in KRS 350.151, in promulgating
25 permitting requirements for these operations.
26 (13) Any valid permit issued pursuant to this chapter shall carry with it the right of
27 successive renewal upon expiration with respect to areas within the boundaries of

1 the existing permit. An applicant for renewal of a permit shall pay a basic fee set by
2 regulation, not to exceed seven hundred fifty dollars ($750). The holders of the
3 permit may apply for renewal and the renewal shall be issued, provided that on
4 application for renewal the burden shall be on the opponents of renewal, subsequent
5 to the fulfillment of the public notice requirements of this chapter, unless it is
6 established and written findings by the cabinet are made that:
7 (a) The terms and conditions of the existing permit are not being satisfactorily
8 met;
9 (b) The present surface coal mining and reclamation operation is not in
10 compliance with the environmental protection standards of this chapter;
11 (c) The renewal requested substantially jeopardizes the applicant's continuing
12 responsibility on existing permit areas;
13 (d) The applicant has not provided evidence that the performance bond in effect
14 for the operation will continue in full force and effect for any renewal
15 requested in the application as well as any additional bond the cabinet might
16 require; or
17 (e) Any additional revised or updated information required by the cabinet has not
18 been provided.
19 Prior to the approval of any renewal of permit, the cabinet shall provide notice to
20 the appropriate public authorities.
21 (14) If an application for renewal of a valid permit includes a proposal to extend the
22 mining operation beyond the boundaries authorized in the existing permit, the
23 portion of the application for renewal of a valid permit which addresses any new
24 areas of surface disturbance shall be subject to the full standards applicable to new
25 applications under this chapter.
26 (15) Any permit renewal shall be for a term not to exceed the period of the original
27 permit. Application for permit renewal shall be made at least one hundred twenty

1 (120) days prior to the expiration of the valid permit.
2 (16) Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this section, a permit shall terminate if the
3 permittee has not commenced the surface coal mining operations covered by the
4 permit within three (3) years of the issuance of the permit. However, the cabinet
5 may grant reasonable extensions of time upon a showing that the extensions are
6 necessary by reason of litigation precluding commencement of operations, or
7 threatening substantial economic loss to the permittee, or by reason of conditions
8 beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the permittee. With
9 respect to coal to be mined for use in a synthetic fuel facility or specific major
10 electric generating facility, the permittee shall be deemed to have commenced
11 surface mining operations at the time the construction of the synthetic fuel or
12 generating facility is initiated.
13 (17) Each application for a permit or revision for auger mining on a previously mined
14 area shall contain information to describe the area to be affected, to show that the
15 proposed method of operation will result in stable post-mining conditions, and
16 reduce or eliminate adverse environmental conditions created by previous mining
17 activities. If the cabinet determines that the affected area cannot be stabilized and
18 reclaimed subsequent to augering or that the operation will result in an adverse
19 impact to the proposed or adjacent area, the permit or revision shall not be issued.
20 The cabinet shall, consistent with all applicable requirements of this chapter, issue a
21 permit or revision if the applicant demonstrates that the proposed coal mining
22 operations will provide for reduction or elimination of the highwall, or reduction or
23 abatement of adverse impacts resulting from past mining activities, or stabilization
24 or enhancement of a previously mined area. The cabinet shall insure that all
25 reasonably available spoil material will be used to backfill the highwall to the
26 extent practical and feasible; provided, however, that in all cases the holes be
27 properly sealed and backfilled to a minimum of four (4) feet above the coal seam

1 being mined.
2 (18) All operations involving the loading of coal which do not separate the coal from its
3 impurities, and which are not located at or near the mine site, shall be exempt from
4 the requirements of this chapter.

6 Commonwealth’s environmental protection laws that waters be properly defined, and
7 critical to the health and safety of the citizens of the Commonwealth that appropriate
8 financial assurance be obtained to address long-term post-mining water discharges in the
9 event of operator default, an emergency is declared to exist, and this Act takes effect
10 upon its passage and approval by the Governor or upon its otherwise becoming a law.

1 topographic map or other map acceptable to the cabinet meeting the requirements of
2 paragraphs (a) to (i) of this subsection. The map shall:
3 (a) Be prepared and certified by a professional engineer registered under the
4 provisions of KRS Chapter 322. The certification shall be in the form as
5 provided in subsection (8) of this section, except that the engineer shall not be
6 required to certify the true ownership of property under paragraph (d) of this
7 subsection;
8 (b) Identify the area to correspond with the application;
9 (c) Show adjacent deep mining;
10 (d) Show the boundaries of surface properties and names of owners of the

1 discharge.
2 (7) Each application shall include a determination of the probable hydrologic
3 consequences of the mining and reclamation operations, both on and off the mine
4 site, with respect to the hydrologic regime, quantity and quality of water in surface
5 and groundwater systems, including the dissolved and suspended solids under
6 seasonal flow conditions, and the collection of sufficient data for the mine site and
7 surrounding areas so that an assessment can be made by the cabinet of the probable
8 cumulative impacts of all anticipated mining in the area upon the hydrology of the
9 area and particularly upon water availability. This determination shall not be
10 required until the time hydrologic information on the general area prior to mining is
11 made available from an appropriate federal or state agency. The permit shall not be
12 approved until the information is available and is incorporated into the application.
13 (8) All certifications required by this chapter to be made by professional engineers shall
14 be done in the form prescribed by the cabinet and shall be reasonably specific as to
15 the work being certified. The cabinet may reject any document or map as
16 incomplete if it is not properly certified.
17 (9) In addition to the information and maps required above, each application for a
18 permit shall be accompanied by detailed plans or proposals showing the method of
19 operation; the manner, time, and distance for backfilling; grading work; and a
20 reclamation plan for the affected area, which proposals shall meet the requirements
21 of this chapter and administrative regulations adopted pursuant thereto.
22 (10) The application for a permit shall be accompanied by proof that the applicant has
23 public liability insurance coverage satisfactory to the cabinet for the surface mining
24 and reclamation operations for which the permit is sought, or proof that the
25 applicant has satisfied self-insurance requirements as provided by administrative
26 regulations of the cabinet. The coverage shall be maintained in full force and effect
27 during the terms of the permit and any permit renewal, and until reclamation

1 operations are completed.
2 (11) (a) A basic fee set by administrative regulation, and bearing a reasonable
3 relationship to the cost of processing the permit application but not to exceed
4 two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500), plus a fee set by administrative
5 regulation but not to exceed seventy-five dollars ($75), for each acre or
6 fraction thereof of the area of land to be affected by the operation, shall be
7 paid before the permit required in this section shall be issued; provided that if
8 the cabinet approves an incremental bonding plan submitted by the applicant,
9 the acreage fees may be paid in increments and at times corresponding to the
10 approved plan.
11 (b) The applicant shall file with the cabinet a bond payable to the Commonwealth
12 of Kentucky with surety satisfactory to the cabinet in the sum to be
13 determined by the cabinet for each acre or fraction thereof of the area of land
14 affected, with a minimum bond of ten thousand dollars ($10,000), conditioned
15 upon the faithful performance of the requirements set forth in this chapter and
16 of the administrative regulations of the cabinet. The cabinet shall forfeit the
17 entire amount of the bond for the permit area or increment in the event of
18 forfeiture.
19 (c) In determining the amount of the bond, the cabinet shall take into
20 consideration the:
21 1. Character and nature of the overburden;
22 2. [the ]Future suitable use of the land involved;
23 3. [the ]Cost of backfilling, grading, and reclamation to be required; and
24 4. [the ]Probable difficulty of reclamation, giving consideration to such
25 factors as topography, geology, hydrology, and revegetation potential.
26 (d) The bond amount shall initially be computed to be sufficient to ensure
27 completion of reclamation if the work had to be performed by the cabinet in
Page 25 of 29

1 the event of forfeiture.
2 (e) For any permit or permit increment identified by the cabinet as requiring
3 long-term treatment, the cabinet shall calculate an additional bond or other
4 financial assurance instrument amount based on the estimated annual
5 treatment cost, provided by the permittee and verified by the cabinet,
6 multiplied by a factor of twenty-five (25), plus any capital cost of the
7 treatment system. The cabinet shall use its own estimate for annual
8 treatment costs if the cabinet cannot verify the permittee's estimate.
9 (f) Within thirty (30) days of a cabinet determination of a need to change a bond
10 protocol currently in use, the cabinet shall immediately promulgate
11 administrative regulations setting forth bonding requirements, including but
12 not limited to requirements for the amount, duration, release, and forfeiture of
13 bonds. Bond protocols shall not be exempt from KRS 13A.100 and shall be
14 established by promulgating administrative regulations under KRS Chapter
15 13A. Failure to include the formula for establishing the amount of the bond in
16 any administrative regulation on bonding requirements shall be deemed a
17 failure to comply with the prescriptions of this section and the administrative
18 regulation shall automatically be declared deficient in accordance with KRS
19 Chapter 13A.
20 (12) The cabinet shall promulgate administrative regulations for the permitting of
21 operations with surface effects of underground mining and other surface coal
22 mining and reclamation operations consistent with this section. The cabinet shall
23 recognize the distinct differences between the surface effects of underground
24 mining and strip mining, as also provided in KRS 350.151, in promulgating
25 permitting requirements for these operations.
26 (13) Any valid permit issued pursuant to this chapter shall carry with it the right of
27 successive renewal upon expiration with respect to areas within the boundaries of
Page 26 of 29
BR126400.100 - 1264 - XXXX 2/14/2025 10:36 AM Jacketed

1 the existing permit. An applicant for renewal of a permit shall pay a basic fee set by
2 regulation, not to exceed seven hundred fifty dollars ($750). The holders of the
3 permit may apply for renewal and the renewal shall be issued, provided that on
4 application for renewal the burden shall be on the opponents of renewal, subsequent
5 to the fulfillment of the public notice requirements of this chapter, unless it is
6 established and written findings by the cabinet are made that:
7 (a) The terms and conditions of the existing permit are not being satisfactorily
8 met;
9 (b) The present surface coal mining and reclamation operation is not in
10 compliance with the environmental protection standards of this chapter;
11 (c) The renewal requested substantially jeopardizes the applicant's continuing
12 responsibility on existing permit areas;
13 (d) The applicant has not provided evidence that the performance bond in effect
14 for the operation will continue in full force and effect for any renewal
15 requested in the application as well as any additional bond the cabinet might
16 require; or
17 (e) Any additional revised or updated information required by the cabinet has not
18 been provided.
19 Prior to the approval of any renewal of permit, the cabinet shall provide notice to
20 the appropriate public authorities.
21 (14) If an application for renewal of a valid permit includes a proposal to extend the
22 mining operation beyond the boundaries authorized in the existing permit, the
23 portion of the application for renewal of a valid permit which addresses any new
24 areas of surface disturbance shall be subject to the full standards applicable to new
25 applications under this chapter.
26 (15) Any permit renewal shall be for a term not to exceed the period of the original
27 permit. Application for permit renewal shall be made at least one hundred twenty
Page 27 of 29

1 (120) days prior to the expiration of the valid permit.
2 (16) Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this section, a permit shall terminate if the
3 permittee has not commenced the surface coal mining operations covered by the
4 permit within three (3) years of the issuance of the permit. However, the cabinet
5 may grant reasonable extensions of time upon a showing that the extensions are
6 necessary by reason of litigation precluding commencement of operations, or
7 threatening substantial economic loss to the permittee, or by reason of conditions
8 beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the permittee. With
9 respect to coal to be mined for use in a synthetic fuel facility or specific major
10 electric generating facility, the permittee shall be deemed to have commenced
11 surface mining operations at the time the construction of the synthetic fuel or
12 generating facility is initiated.
13 (17) Each application for a permit or revision for auger mining on a previously mined
14 area shall contain information to describe the area to be affected, to show that the
15 proposed method of operation will result in stable post-mining conditions, and
16 reduce or eliminate adverse environmental conditions created by previous mining
17 activities. If the cabinet determines that the affected area cannot be stabilized and
18 reclaimed subsequent to augering or that the operation will result in an adverse
19 impact to the proposed or adjacent area, the permit or revision shall not be issued.
20 The cabinet shall, consistent with all applicable requirements of this chapter, issue a
21 permit or revision if the applicant demonstrates that the proposed coal mining
22 operations will provide for reduction or elimination of the highwall, or reduction or
23 abatement of adverse impacts resulting from past mining activities, or stabilization
24 or enhancement of a previously mined area. The cabinet shall insure that all
25 reasonably available spoil material will be used to backfill the highwall to the
26 extent practical and feasible; provided, however, that in all cases the holes be
27 properly sealed and backfilled to a minimum of four (4) feet above the coal seam

1 being mined.
2 (18) All operations involving the loading of coal which do not separate the coal from its
3 impurities, and which are not located at or near the mine site, shall be exempt from
4 the requirements of this chapter.
5 Section 5. Whereas it is critical to the orderly administration of the
6 Commonwealth’s environmental protection laws that waters be properly defined, and
7 critical to the health and safety of the citizens of the Commonwealth that appropriate
8 financial assurance be obtained to address long-term post-mining water discharges in the
9 event of operator default, an emergency is declared to exist, and this Act takes effect
10 upon its passage and approval by the Governor or upon its otherwise becoming a law.
