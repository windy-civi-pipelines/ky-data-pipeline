ïƒ¢Section 4. KRS 350.060 is amended to read as follows:
(1) (a) No person shall engage in surface coal mining and reclamation operations without having first obtained
from the cabinet a permit designating the area of land affected by the operation. Permits shall authorize
the permittee to engage in surface coal mining and reclamation operations upon the area of land
described in his application for a period not to exceed five (5) years. However, if an applicant
demonstrates that a specified longer term is reasonably needed to obtain necessary financing for
equipment and the opening of the operation and if the application is full and complete for the specified
longer term, the cabinet may grant a permit for the longer term. No mining shall be permitted beyond
the time period obligations of the initial or extended bond coverage.
(b) Subject to the provisions of KRS 350.010(1) and (2), no person shall knowingly and willfully receive,
transport, sell, convey, transfer, trade, exchange, donate, purchase, deliver, or in any way derive benefit
from coal removed from any surface mining operation which does not have a permit as required under
this section.
(2) No permit or revision application shall be approved unless the application affirmatively demonstrates, and the
cabinet finds in writing on the basis of the information set forth in the application or from information
otherwise available, that the permit application is accurate and complete and that all the requirements of this
chapter have been complied with.
(3) A person desiring a permit to engage in surface coal mining operations shall file an application which shall
state:
(a) The location and area of land to be affected by the operation, with a description of access to the area
from the nearest public highways;

reclamation operations, both on and off the mine site, with respect to the hydrologic regime, quantity and

CHAPTER 119 11
quality of water in surface and groundwater systems, including the dissolved and suspended solids under
seasonal flow conditions, and the collection of sufficient data for the mine site and surrounding areas so that an
assessment can be made by the cabinet of the probable cumulative impacts of all anticipated mining in the area
upon the hydrology of the area and particularly upon water availability. This determination shall not be
required until the time hydrologic information on the general area prior to mining is made available from an
appropriate federal or state agency. The permit shall not be approved until the information is available and is
incorporated into the application.
(8) All certifications required by this chapter to be made by professional engineers shall be done in the form
prescribed by the cabinet and shall be reasonably specific as to the work being certified. The cabinet may
reject any document or map as incomplete if it is not properly certified.
(9) In addition to the information and maps required above, each application for a permit shall be accompanied by
detailed plans or proposals showing the method of operation; the manner, time, and distance for backfilling;
grading work; and a reclamation plan for the affected area, which proposals shall meet the requirements of this
chapter and administrative regulations adopted pursuant thereto.
(10) The application for a permit shall be accompanied by proof that the applicant has public liability insurance
coverage satisfactory to the cabinet for the surface mining and reclamation operations for which the permit is
sought, or proof that the applicant has satisfied self-insurance requirements as provided by administrative
regulations of the cabinet. The coverage shall be maintained in full force and effect during the terms of the
permit and any permit renewal, and until reclamation operations are completed.
(11) (a) A basic fee set by administrative regulation, and bearing a reasonable relationship to the cost of
processing the permit application but not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500), plus a
fee set by administrative regulation but not to exceed seventy-five dollars ($75), for each acre or
fraction thereof of the area of land to be affected by the operation, shall be paid before the permit
required in this section shall be issued; provided that if the cabinet approves an incremental bonding
plan submitted by the applicant, the acreage fees may be paid in increments and at times corresponding
to the approved plan.
(b) The applicant shall file with the cabinet a bond payable to the Commonwealth of Kentucky with surety
satisfactory to the cabinet in the sum to be determined by the cabinet for each acre or fraction thereof of
the area of land affected, with a minimum bond of ten thousand dollars ($10,000), conditioned upon the
faithful performance of the requirements set forth in this chapter and of the administrative regulations of
the cabinet. The cabinet shall forfeit the entire amount of the bond for the permit area or increment in
the event of forfeiture.
(c) In determining the amount of the bond, the cabinet shall take into consideration the:
1. Character and nature of the overburden;
2. [the ]Future suitable use of the land involved;
3. [the ]Cost of backfilling, grading, and reclamation to be required; and
4. [the ]Probable difficulty of reclamation, giving consideration to such factors as topography,
geology, hydrology, and revegetation potential.
(d) The bond amount shall initially be computed to be sufficient to ensure completion of reclamation if the
work had to be performed by the cabinet in the event of forfeiture.
(e) For any permit or permit increment identified by the cabinet as requiring long-term treatment, the
cabinet shall calculate an additional bond or other financial assurance instrument amount based on
the estimated annual treatment cost, provided by the permittee and verified by the cabinet, multiplied
by a factor of twenty-five (25), plus any capital cost of the treatment system. The cabinet shall use its
own estimate for annual treatment costs if the cabinet cannot verify the permittee's estimate.
(f) Within thirty (30) days of a cabinet determination of a need to change a bond protocol currently in use,
the cabinet shall immediately promulgate administrative regulations setting forth bonding requirements,
including but not limited to requirements for the amount, duration, release, and forfeiture of bonds.
Bond protocols shall not be exempt from KRS 13A.100 and shall be established by promulgating
administrative regulations under KRS Chapter 13A. Failure to include the formula for establishing the
amount of the bond in any administrative regulation on bonding requirements shall be deemed a failure

12 ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY
to comply with the prescriptions of this section and the administrative regulation shall automatically be
declared deficient in accordance with KRS Chapter 13A.
(12) The cabinet shall promulgate administrative regulations for the permitting of operations with surface effects of
underground mining and other surface coal mining and reclamation operations consistent with this section.
The cabinet shall recognize the distinct differences between the surface effects of underground mining and
strip mining, as also provided in KRS 350.151, in promulgating permitting requirements for these operations.
(13) Any valid permit issued pursuant to this chapter shall carry with it the right of successive renewal upon
expiration with respect to areas within the boundaries of the existing permit. An applicant for renewal of a
permit shall pay a basic fee set by regulation, not to exceed seven hundred fifty dollars ($750). The holders of
the permit may apply for renewal and the renewal shall be issued, provided that on application for renewal the
burden shall be on the opponents of renewal, subsequent to the fulfillment of the public notice requirements of
this chapter, unless it is established and written findings by the cabinet are made that:
(a) The terms and conditions of the existing permit are not being satisfactorily met;
(b) The present surface coal mining and reclamation operation is not in compliance with the environmental
protection standards of this chapter;
(c) The renewal requested substantially jeopardizes the applicant's continuing responsibility on existing
permit areas;
(d) The applicant has not provided evidence that the performance bond in effect for the operation will
continue in full force and effect for any renewal requested in the application as well as any additional
bond the cabinet might require; or
(e) Any additional revised or updated information required by the cabinet has not been provided.
Prior to the approval of any renewal of permit, the cabinet shall provide notice to the appropriate public
authorities.
(14) If an application for renewal of a valid permit includes a proposal to extend the mining operation beyond the
boundaries authorized in the existing permit, the portion of the application for renewal of a valid permit which
addresses any new areas of surface disturbance shall be subject to the full standards applicable to new
applications under this chapter.
(15) Any permit renewal shall be for a term not to exceed the period of the original permit. Application for permit
renewal shall be made at least one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the expiration of the valid permit.
(16) Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this section, a permit shall terminate if the permittee has not
commenced the surface coal mining operations covered by the permit within three (3) years of the issuance of
the permit. However, the cabinet may grant reasonable extensions of time upon a showing that the extensions
are necessary by reason of litigation precluding commencement of operations, or threatening substantial
economic loss to the permittee, or by reason of conditions beyond the control and without the fault or
negligence of the permittee. With respect to coal to be mined for use in a synthetic fuel facility or specific
major electric generating facility, the permittee shall be deemed to have commenced surface mining operations
at the time the construction of the synthetic fuel or generating facility is initiated.
(17) Each application for a permit or revision for auger mining on a previously mined area shall contain
information to describe the area to be affected, to show that the proposed method of operation will result in
stable post-mining conditions, and reduce or eliminate adverse environmental conditions created by previous
mining activities. If the cabinet determines that the affected area cannot be stabilized and reclaimed subsequent
to augering or that the operation will result in an adverse impact to the proposed or adjacent area, the permit or
revision shall not be issued. The cabinet shall, consistent with all applicable requirements of this chapter, issue
a permit or revision if the applicant demonstrates that the proposed coal mining operations will provide for
reduction or elimination of the highwall, or reduction or abatement of adverse impacts resulting from past
mining activities, or stabilization or enhancement of a previously mined area. The cabinet shall insure that all
reasonably available spoil material will be used to backfill the highwall to the extent practical and feasible;
provided, however, that in all cases the holes be properly sealed and backfilled to a minimum of four (4) feet
above the coal seam being mined.
(18) All operations involving the loading of coal which do not separate the coal from its impurities, and which are
not located at or near the mine site, shall be exempt from the requirements of this chapter.

CHAPTER 119 13
ïƒ¢Section 5. Whereas it is critical to the orderly administration of the Commonwealthâ€™s environmental
protection laws that waters be properly defined, and critical to the health and safety of the citizens of the
Commonwealth that appropriate financial assurance be obtained to address long-term post-mining water discharges
in the event of operator default, an emergency is declared to exist, and this Act takes effect upon its passage and
approval by the Governor or upon its otherwise becoming a law.
