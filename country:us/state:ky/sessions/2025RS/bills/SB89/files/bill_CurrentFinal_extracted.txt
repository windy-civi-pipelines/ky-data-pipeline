1 consideration the:
2 1. Character and nature of the overburden;
3 2. [the ]Future suitable use of the land involved;
4 3. [the ]Cost of backfilling, grading, and reclamation to be required; and
5 4. [the ]Probable difficulty of reclamation, giving consideration to such
6 factors as topography, geology, hydrology, and revegetation potential.
7 (d) The bond amount shall initially be computed to be sufficient to ensure
8 completion of reclamation if the work had to be performed by the cabinet in
9 the event of forfeiture.
10 (e) For any permit or permit increment identified by the cabinet as requiring
11 long-term treatment, the cabinet shall calculate an additional bond or other
12 financial assurance instrument amount based on the estimated annual
13 treatment cost, provided by the permittee and verified by the cabinet,
14 multiplied by a factor of twenty-five (25), plus any capital cost of the
15 treatment system. The cabinet shall use its own estimate for annual
16 treatment costs if the cabinet cannot verify the permittee's estimate.
17 (f) Within thirty (30) days of a cabinet determination of a need to change a bond
18 protocol currently in use, the cabinet shall immediately promulgate
19 administrative regulations setting forth bonding requirements, including but
20 not limited to requirements for the amount, duration, release, and forfeiture of
21 bonds. Bond protocols shall not be exempt from KRS 13A.100 and shall be
22 established by promulgating administrative regulations under KRS Chapter
23 13A. Failure to include the formula for establishing the amount of the bond in
24 any administrative regulation on bonding requirements shall be deemed a
25 failure to comply with the prescriptions of this section and the administrative
26 regulation shall automatically be declared deficient in accordance with KRS
27 Chapter 13A.

1 (12) The cabinet shall promulgate administrative regulations for the permitting of
2 operations with surface effects of underground mining and other surface coal
3 mining and reclamation operations consistent with this section. The cabinet shall
4 recognize the distinct differences between the surface effects of underground
5 mining and strip mining, as also provided in KRS 350.151, in promulgating
6 permitting requirements for these operations.
7 (13) Any valid permit issued pursuant to this chapter shall carry with it the right of
8 successive renewal upon expiration with respect to areas within the boundaries of
9 the existing permit. An applicant for renewal of a permit shall pay a basic fee set by
10 regulation, not to exceed seven hundred fifty dollars ($750). The holders of the
11 permit may apply for renewal and the renewal shall be issued, provided that on
12 application for renewal the burden shall be on the opponents of renewal, subsequent
13 to the fulfillment of the public notice requirements of this chapter, unless it is
14 established and written findings by the cabinet are made that:
15 (a) The terms and conditions of the existing permit are not being satisfactorily
16 met;
17 (b) The present surface coal mining and reclamation operation is not in
18 compliance with the environmental protection standards of this chapter;
19 (c) The renewal requested substantially jeopardizes the applicant's continuing
20 responsibility on existing permit areas;
21 (d) The applicant has not provided evidence that the performance bond in effect
22 for the operation will continue in full force and effect for any renewal
23 requested in the application as well as any additional bond the cabinet might
24 require; or
25 (e) Any additional revised or updated information required by the cabinet has not
26 been provided.

1 the appropriate public authorities.
2 (14) If an application for renewal of a valid permit includes a proposal to extend the
3 mining operation beyond the boundaries authorized in the existing permit, the
4 portion of the application for renewal of a valid permit which addresses any new
5 areas of surface disturbance shall be subject to the full standards applicable to new
6 applications under this chapter.
7 (15) Any permit renewal shall be for a term not to exceed the period of the original
8 permit. Application for permit renewal shall be made at least one hundred twenty
9 (120) days prior to the expiration of the valid permit.
10 (16) Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this section, a permit shall terminate if the
11 permittee has not commenced the surface coal mining operations covered by the
12 permit within three (3) years of the issuance of the permit. However, the cabinet
13 may grant reasonable extensions of time upon a showing that the extensions are
14 necessary by reason of litigation precluding commencement of operations, or
15 threatening substantial economic loss to the permittee, or by reason of conditions
16 beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the permittee. With
17 respect to coal to be mined for use in a synthetic fuel facility or specific major
18 electric generating facility, the permittee shall be deemed to have commenced
19 surface mining operations at the time the construction of the synthetic fuel or
20 generating facility is initiated.
21 (17) Each application for a permit or revision for auger mining on a previously mined
22 area shall contain information to describe the area to be affected, to show that the
23 proposed method of operation will result in stable post-mining conditions, and
24 reduce or eliminate adverse environmental conditions created by previous mining
25 activities. If the cabinet determines that the affected area cannot be stabilized and
26 reclaimed subsequent to augering or that the operation will result in an adverse
27 impact to the proposed or adjacent area, the permit or revision shall not be issued.

1 The cabinet shall, consistent with all applicable requirements of this chapter, issue a
2 permit or revision if the applicant demonstrates that the proposed coal mining
3 operations will provide for reduction or elimination of the highwall, or reduction or
4 abatement of adverse impacts resulting from past mining activities, or stabilization
5 or enhancement of a previously mined area. The cabinet shall insure that all
6 reasonably available spoil material will be used to backfill the highwall to the
7 extent practical and feasible; provided, however, that in all cases the holes be
8 properly sealed and backfilled to a minimum of four (4) feet above the coal seam
9 being mined.
10 (18) All operations involving the loading of coal which do not separate the coal from its
11 impurities, and which are not located at or near the mine site, shall be exempt from
12 the requirements of this chapter.
13 Section 5. Whereas it is critical to the orderly administration of the
14 Commonwealth’s environmental protection laws that waters be properly defined, and
15 critical to the health and safety of the citizens of the Commonwealth that appropriate
16 financial assurance be obtained to address long-term post-mining water discharges in the
17 event of operator default, an emergency is declared to exist, and this Act takes effect
18 upon its passage and approval by the Governor or upon its otherwise becoming a law.

10 (7) Each application shall include a determination of the probable hydrologic
11 consequences of the mining and reclamation operations, both on and off the mine
12 site, with respect to the hydrologic regime, quantity and quality of water in surface
13 and groundwater systems, including the dissolved and suspended solids under
14 seasonal flow conditions, and the collection of sufficient data for the mine site and
15 surrounding areas so that an assessment can be made by the cabinet of the probable
16 cumulative impacts of all anticipated mining in the area upon the hydrology of the
17 area and particularly upon water availability. This determination shall not be
18 required until the time hydrologic information on the general area prior to mining is
19 made available from an appropriate federal or state agency. The permit shall not be
20 approved until the information is available and is incorporated into the application.
21 (8) All certifications required by this chapter to be made by professional engineers shall
22 be done in the form prescribed by the cabinet and shall be reasonably specific as to
23 the work being certified. The cabinet may reject any document or map as
24 incomplete if it is not properly certified.
25 (9) In addition to the information and maps required above, each application for a
26 permit shall be accompanied by detailed plans or proposals showing the method of
27 operation; the manner, time, and distance for backfilling; grading work; and a

1 reclamation plan for the affected area, which proposals shall meet the requirements
2 of this chapter and administrative regulations adopted pursuant thereto.
3 (10) The application for a permit shall be accompanied by proof that the applicant has
4 public liability insurance coverage satisfactory to the cabinet for the surface mining
5 and reclamation operations for which the permit is sought, or proof that the
6 applicant has satisfied self-insurance requirements as provided by administrative
7 regulations of the cabinet. The coverage shall be maintained in full force and effect
8 during the terms of the permit and any permit renewal, and until reclamation
9 operations are completed.
10 (11) (a) A basic fee set by administrative regulation, and bearing a reasonable
11 relationship to the cost of processing the permit application but not to exceed
12 two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500), plus a fee set by administrative
13 regulation but not to exceed seventy-five dollars ($75), for each acre or
14 fraction thereof of the area of land to be affected by the operation, shall be
15 paid before the permit required in this section shall be issued; provided that if
16 the cabinet approves an incremental bonding plan submitted by the applicant,
17 the acreage fees may be paid in increments and at times corresponding to the
18 approved plan.
19 (b) The applicant shall file with the cabinet a bond payable to the Commonwealth
20 of Kentucky with surety satisfactory to the cabinet in the sum to be
21 determined by the cabinet for each acre or fraction thereof of the area of land
22 affected, with a minimum bond of ten thousand dollars ($10,000), conditioned
23 upon the faithful performance of the requirements set forth in this chapter and
24 of the administrative regulations of the cabinet. The cabinet shall forfeit the
25 entire amount of the bond for the permit area or increment in the event of
26 forfeiture.
27 (c) In determining the amount of the bond, the cabinet shall take into

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS SB 89/VO
1 consideration the:
2 1. Character and nature of the overburden;
3 2. [the ]Future suitable use of the land involved;
4 3. [the ]Cost of backfilling, grading, and reclamation to be required; and
5 4. [the ]Probable difficulty of reclamation, giving consideration to such
6 factors as topography, geology, hydrology, and revegetation potential.
7 (d) The bond amount shall initially be computed to be sufficient to ensure
8 completion of reclamation if the work had to be performed by the cabinet in
9 the event of forfeiture.
10 (e) For any permit or permit increment identified by the cabinet as requiring
11 long-term treatment, the cabinet shall calculate an additional bond or other
12 financial assurance instrument amount based on the estimated annual
13 treatment cost, provided by the permittee and verified by the cabinet,
14 multiplied by a factor of twenty-five (25), plus any capital cost of the
15 treatment system. The cabinet shall use its own estimate for annual
16 treatment costs if the cabinet cannot verify the permittee's estimate.
17 (f) Within thirty (30) days of a cabinet determination of a need to change a bond
18 protocol currently in use, the cabinet shall immediately promulgate
19 administrative regulations setting forth bonding requirements, including but
20 not limited to requirements for the amount, duration, release, and forfeiture of
21 bonds. Bond protocols shall not be exempt from KRS 13A.100 and shall be
22 established by promulgating administrative regulations under KRS Chapter
23 13A. Failure to include the formula for establishing the amount of the bond in
24 any administrative regulation on bonding requirements shall be deemed a
25 failure to comply with the prescriptions of this section and the administrative
26 regulation shall automatically be declared deficient in accordance with KRS
27 Chapter 13A.

1 (12) The cabinet shall promulgate administrative regulations for the permitting of
2 operations with surface effects of underground mining and other surface coal
3 mining and reclamation operations consistent with this section. The cabinet shall
4 recognize the distinct differences between the surface effects of underground
5 mining and strip mining, as also provided in KRS 350.151, in promulgating
6 permitting requirements for these operations.
7 (13) Any valid permit issued pursuant to this chapter shall carry with it the right of
8 successive renewal upon expiration with respect to areas within the boundaries of
9 the existing permit. An applicant for renewal of a permit shall pay a basic fee set by
10 regulation, not to exceed seven hundred fifty dollars ($750). The holders of the
11 permit may apply for renewal and the renewal shall be issued, provided that on
12 application for renewal the burden shall be on the opponents of renewal, subsequent
13 to the fulfillment of the public notice requirements of this chapter, unless it is
14 established and written findings by the cabinet are made that:
15 (a) The terms and conditions of the existing permit are not being satisfactorily
16 met;
17 (b) The present surface coal mining and reclamation operation is not in
18 compliance with the environmental protection standards of this chapter;
19 (c) The renewal requested substantially jeopardizes the applicant's continuing
20 responsibility on existing permit areas;
21 (d) The applicant has not provided evidence that the performance bond in effect
22 for the operation will continue in full force and effect for any renewal
23 requested in the application as well as any additional bond the cabinet might
24 require; or
25 (e) Any additional revised or updated information required by the cabinet has not
26 been provided.
27 Prior to the approval of any renewal of permit, the cabinet shall provide notice to
Page 27 of 29

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS SB 89/VO
1 the appropriate public authorities.
2 (14) If an application for renewal of a valid permit includes a proposal to extend the
3 mining operation beyond the boundaries authorized in the existing permit, the
4 portion of the application for renewal of a valid permit which addresses any new
5 areas of surface disturbance shall be subject to the full standards applicable to new
6 applications under this chapter.
7 (15) Any permit renewal shall be for a term not to exceed the period of the original
8 permit. Application for permit renewal shall be made at least one hundred twenty
9 (120) days prior to the expiration of the valid permit.
10 (16) Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this section, a permit shall terminate if the
11 permittee has not commenced the surface coal mining operations covered by the
12 permit within three (3) years of the issuance of the permit. However, the cabinet
13 may grant reasonable extensions of time upon a showing that the extensions are
14 necessary by reason of litigation precluding commencement of operations, or
15 threatening substantial economic loss to the permittee, or by reason of conditions
16 beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the permittee. With
17 respect to coal to be mined for use in a synthetic fuel facility or specific major
18 electric generating facility, the permittee shall be deemed to have commenced
19 surface mining operations at the time the construction of the synthetic fuel or
20 generating facility is initiated.
21 (17) Each application for a permit or revision for auger mining on a previously mined
22 area shall contain information to describe the area to be affected, to show that the
23 proposed method of operation will result in stable post-mining conditions, and
24 reduce or eliminate adverse environmental conditions created by previous mining
25 activities. If the cabinet determines that the affected area cannot be stabilized and
26 reclaimed subsequent to augering or that the operation will result in an adverse
27 impact to the proposed or adjacent area, the permit or revision shall not be issued.

1 The cabinet shall, consistent with all applicable requirements of this chapter, issue a
2 permit or revision if the applicant demonstrates that the proposed coal mining
3 operations will provide for reduction or elimination of the highwall, or reduction or
4 abatement of adverse impacts resulting from past mining activities, or stabilization
5 or enhancement of a previously mined area. The cabinet shall insure that all
6 reasonably available spoil material will be used to backfill the highwall to the
7 extent practical and feasible; provided, however, that in all cases the holes be
8 properly sealed and backfilled to a minimum of four (4) feet above the coal seam
9 being mined.
10 (18) All operations involving the loading of coal which do not separate the coal from its
11 impurities, and which are not located at or near the mine site, shall be exempt from
12 the requirements of this chapter.
13 Section 5. Whereas it is critical to the orderly administration of the
14 Commonwealth’s environmental protection laws that waters be properly defined, and
15 critical to the health and safety of the citizens of the Commonwealth that appropriate
16 financial assurance be obtained to address long-term post-mining water discharges in the
17 event of operator default, an emergency is declared to exist, and this Act takes effect
18 upon its passage and approval by the Governor or upon its otherwise becoming a law.
