UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS HB 114/GA
2 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
3 Section 1. KRS 150.645 is amended to read as follows:
4 (1) An owner, lessee, or occupant of premises who gives permission to another person
5 to hunt, fish, trap, camp, [or ]hike, rock climb, boulder, or rappel upon the
6 premises shall owe no duty to keep the premises safe for entry or use by the person
7 or to give warning of any hazardous conditions on the premises, and the owner,
8 lessee, or occupant, by giving his or her permission, does not thereby extend any
9 assurance that the premises are safe for such purpose, or constitute the person to
10 whom permission is granted an invitee to whom a duty of care is owed. The owner,
11 lessee, or occupant giving permission for any of the purposes stated above shall not
12 be liable for any injury to any person or property caused by the negligent acts of
13 any person to whom permission is granted. This section shall not limit the liability
14 which would otherwise exist for willful and malicious failure to guard or to warn
15 against a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity; or for injury suffered in
16 any case where permission to hunt, fish, trap, camp, [or ]hike, rock climb, boulder,
17 or rappel was granted for a consideration other than the consideration, if any, as set
18 forth in KRS 411.190(1)(d), paid to said owner, lessee, or occupant by the state.
19 The word "premises" as used in this section includes lands, rocks, boulders, cliffs,
20 private ways, and any buildings and structures thereon. Nothing in this section
21 limits in any way any liability which otherwise exists.
22 (2) Department employees who participate in bona fide wildlife management practices
23 are agents of the department and state and, in the event property damage does
24 occur, a claim for property damages may only be brought in the Board of Claims
25 pursuant to KRS 49.040 to 49.180.
26 Section 2. KRS 411.190 is amended to read as follows:

12 that in the case of land leased to the state or a subdivision thereof, any
13 consideration received by the owner for the lease shall not be deemed a
