UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1574
1 United States of America; and
2 b. "Net deferred tax liability" means deferred tax liabilities that

4 KRS 141.202, as computed in accordance with accounting
5 principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

22 liability. The increase in the net deferred tax liability, decrease in the net
23 deferred tax asset, or the aggregate change from a net deferred tax asset

1 6. The deferred tax impact determined in subparagraph 5. of this paragraph
2 shall be converted to the annual deferred tax deduction amount, as
3 follows:
4 a. The deferred tax impact determined in subparagraph 5. of this
5 paragraph shall be divided by the tax rate determined under KRS
6 141.040;
7 b. The resulting amount shall be further divided by the
8 apportionment factor determined by KRS 141.120 or 141.121 that
9 was used by the combined group in the calculation of the deferred
10 tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as described in subparagraph
11 5. of this paragraph; and
12 c. The resulting amount represents the total net deferred tax
13 deduction available over the ten (10) year period as described in
14 subparagraph 5. of this paragraph.
15 7. The deduction calculated under this paragraph shall not be adjusted as a
16 result of any events happening subsequent to the calculation, including
17 but not limited to any disposition or abandonment of assets. The
18 deduction shall be calculated without regard to the federal tax effect and
19 shall not alter the tax basis of any asset. If the deduction under this
20 section is greater than the combined group's entire Kentucky net income,
21 any excess deduction shall be carried forward and applied as a deduction
22 to the combined group's entire net income in future taxable years until
23 fully utilized.
24 8. Any combined group intending to claim a deduction under this
25 paragraph shall file a statement with the department on or before July 1,
26 2019. The statement shall specify the total amount of the deduction
27 which the combined group claims on the form, including calculations

1 United States of America; and
2 b. "Net deferred tax liability" means deferred tax liabilities that
3 exceed the deferred tax assets of a combined group as defined in
4 KRS 141.202, as computed in accordance with accounting
5 principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

7 participating in the filing of a publicly traded company's financial

9 accepted in the United States of America, as of January 1, 2019, shall be

23 deferred tax asset, or the aggregate change from a net deferred tax asset

2 shall be converted to the annual deferred tax deduction amount, as
3 follows:
4 a. The deferred tax impact determined in subparagraph 5. of this
5 paragraph shall be divided by the tax rate determined under KRS
6 141.040;
7 b. The resulting amount shall be further divided by the
8 apportionment factor determined by KRS 141.120 or 141.121 that
9 was used by the combined group in the calculation of the deferred
10 tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as described in subparagraph
11 5. of this paragraph; and
12 c. The resulting amount represents the total net deferred tax
13 deduction available over the ten (10) year period as described in
14 subparagraph 5. of this paragraph.
15 7. The deduction calculated under this paragraph shall not be adjusted as a
16 result of any events happening subsequent to the calculation, including
17 but not limited to any disposition or abandonment of assets. The
18 deduction shall be calculated without regard to the federal tax effect and
19 shall not alter the tax basis of any asset. If the deduction under this
20 section is greater than the combined group's entire Kentucky net income,
21 any excess deduction shall be carried forward and applied as a deduction
22 to the combined group's entire net income in future taxable years until
23 fully utilized.
24 8. Any combined group intending to claim a deduction under this
25 paragraph shall file a statement with the department on or before July 1,
26 2019. The statement shall specify the total amount of the deduction
27 which the combined group claims on the form, including calculations
