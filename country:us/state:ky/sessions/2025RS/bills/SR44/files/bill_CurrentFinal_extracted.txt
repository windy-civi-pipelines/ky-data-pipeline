2 Black history is American history.
3 WHEREAS, in 1776, people envisioned the United States as a new nation dedicated

5 equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among
6 these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness"; and
7 WHEREAS, Africans were first brought involuntarily to the shores of the United
8 States as early as the 17th century; and
9 WHEREAS, African Americans suffered enslavement and subsequently faced the
10 injustices of lynch mobs, segregation, and denial of the basic and fundamental rights of
11 citizenship; and
12 WHEREAS, in 2025, the vestiges of those injustices and inequalities remain
13 evident in the society of the United States; and
14 WHEREAS, in the face of injustices, people of good will and of all races in the
15 United States have distinguished themselves with a commitment to the noble ideals on
16 which the United States was founded and have fought courageously for the rights and
17 freedom of African Americans and others; and
18 WHEREAS, the contributions of African Americans from all walks of life
19 throughout the history of the United States reflect the greatness of the United States; and

21 achieving the recognition those individuals deserved, and yet they paved the way for
22 future generations to succeed; and
23 WHEREAS, African Americans continue to serve the United States at the highest
24 levels of business, government, and the military; and
25 WHEREAS, the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass inspired the

17 else.’"; and
18 WHEREAS, since its founding, the United States has imperfectly progressed
19 toward noble goals; and
20 WHEREAS, the history of the United States is the story of people regularly

23 and
24 WHEREAS, during the month of February 2025, across the United States of
