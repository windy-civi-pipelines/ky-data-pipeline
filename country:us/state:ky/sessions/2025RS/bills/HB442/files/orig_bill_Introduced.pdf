1 AN ACT relating to aggravating circumstances.
2 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
3 Section 1. KRS 532.025 is amended to read as follows:
4 (1) (a) Upon conviction of a defendant in cases where the death penalty may be
5 imposed, a hearing shall be conducted. In such hearing, the judge shall hear
6 additional evidence in extenuation, mitigation, and aggravation of
7 punishment, including the record of any prior criminal convictions and pleas
8 of guilty or pleas of nolo contendere of the defendant, or the absence of any
9 prior conviction and pleas; provided, however, that only such evidence in
10 aggravation as the state has made known to the defendant prior to his or her
11 trial shall be admissible. Subject to the Kentucky Rules of Evidence, juvenile
12 court records of adjudications of guilt of a child for an offense that would be a
13 felony if committed by an adult shall be admissible in court at any time the
14 child is tried as an adult, or after the child becomes an adult, at any
15 subsequent criminal trial relating to that same person. Juvenile court records
16 made available pursuant to this section may be used for impeachment
17 purposes during a criminal trial and may be used during the sentencing phase
18 of a criminal trial; however, the fact that a juvenile has been adjudicated
19 delinquent of an offense that would be a felony if the child had been an adult
20 shall not be used in finding the child to be a persistent felony offender based
21 upon that adjudication. Release of the child's treatment, medical, mental, or
22 psychological records is prohibited unless presented as evidence in Circuit
23 Court. Release of any records resulting from the child's prior abuse and
24 neglect under Title IV-E or IV-B of the Federal Social Security Act is also
25 prohibited. The judge shall also hear argument by the defendant or his or her
26 counsel and the prosecuting attorney, as provided by law, regarding the
27 punishment to be imposed. The prosecuting attorney shall open and the

1 defendant shall conclude the argument. In cases in which the death penalty
2 may be imposed, the judge when sitting without a jury shall follow the
3 additional procedure provided in subsection (2) of this section. Upon the
4 conclusion of the evidence and arguments, the judge shall impose the sentence
5 or shall recess the trial for the purpose of taking the sentence within the limits
6 prescribed by law. If the trial court is reversed on appeal because of error only
7 in the presentence hearing, the new trial which may be ordered shall apply
8 only to the issue of punishment.
9 (b) In all cases in which the death penalty may be imposed and which are tried by
10 a jury, upon a return of a verdict of guilty by the jury, the court shall resume
11 the trial and conduct a presentence hearing before the jury. Such hearing shall
12 be conducted in the same manner as presentence hearings conducted before
13 the judge as provided in paragraph (a) of this subsection, including the record
14 of any prior criminal convictions and pleas of guilty or pleas of nolo
15 contendere of the defendant. Upon the conclusion of the evidence and
16 arguments, the judge shall give the jury appropriate instructions, and the jury
17 shall retire to determine whether any mitigating or aggravating circumstances,
18 as defined in subsection (2) of this section, exist and to recommend a sentence
19 for the defendant. Upon the findings of the jury, the judge shall fix a sentence
20 within the limits prescribed by law.
21 (2) In all cases of offenses for which the death penalty may be authorized, the judge
22 shall consider, or include in his or her instructions to the jury for it to consider, any
23 mitigating circumstances or aggravating circumstances otherwise authorized by law
24 and any of the following statutory aggravating or mitigating circumstances which
25 may be supported by the evidence:
26 (a) Aggravating circumstances:

1 law was impaired as a result of mental illness or an intellectual disability
2 or intoxication even though the impairment of the capacity of the
3 defendant to appreciate the criminality of his or her conduct or to
4 conform the conduct to the requirements of law is insufficient to
5 constitute a defense to the crime; and
6 8. The youth of the defendant at the time of the crime.

12 of twenty-five (25) years of his or her sentence, shall designate in writing, signed by

16 circumstances enumerated in subsection (2) of this section is so found, the death
17 penalty, or imprisonment for life without benefit of probation or parole, or the
