7 evidence in a prosecution under subsection (1)(d) of this section upon a
8 finding by the court that the defendant consumed the substance under a valid
9 prescription from a practitioner, as defined in KRS 218A.010, acting in the

11 (c) While under the influence of any other substance or combination of
12 substances which impairs one's driving ability;
13 (d) While the presence of a controlled substance listed in subsection (12) of this
14 section is detected in the blood, as measured by a scientifically reliable test, or
15 tests, taken within two (2) hours of cessation of operation or physical control
16 of a motor vehicle;
17 (e) While under the combined influence of alcohol and any other substance which
18 impairs one's driving ability; or
19 (f) Having an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or more as measured by a
20 scientifically reliable test or tests of a sample of the person's breath or blood
21 taken within two (2) hours of cessation of operation or physical control of a
22 motor vehicle, if the person is under the age of twenty-one (21).
23 (2) With the exception of the results of the tests administered pursuant to KRS
24 189A.103(7):
25 (a) If the sample of the person's blood or breath that is used to determine the
26 alcohol concentration thereof was obtained more than two (2) hours after

1 test or tests shall be inadmissible as evidence in a prosecution under
2 subsection (1)(a) or (f) of this section. The results of the test or tests, however,
3 may be admissible in a prosecution under subsection (1)(b) or (e) of this
4 section; or
5 (b) If the sample of the person's blood that is used to determine the presence of a
6 controlled substance was obtained more than two (2) hours after cessation of
7 operation or physical control of a motor vehicle, the results of the test or tests
8 shall be inadmissible as evidence in a prosecution under subsection (1)(d) of
9 this section. The results of the test or tests, however, may be admissible in a

11 (3) In any prosecution for a violation of subsection (1)(b) or (e) of this section in which

13 motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, the alcohol concentration in the
14 defendant's blood as determined at the time of making analysis of his or her blood
15 or breath shall give rise to the following presumptions:
16 (a) If there was an alcohol concentration of less than 0.04[ based upon the
17 definition of alcohol concentration in KRS 189A.005], it shall be presumed
18 that the defendant was not under the influence of alcohol; and
19 (b) If there was an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater but less than 0.08[
20 based upon the definition of alcohol concentration in KRS 189A.005], that

22 under the influence of alcohol, but that fact may be considered, together with
23 other competent evidence, in determining the guilt or innocence of the
24 defendant.
25 The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed as limiting the introduction
26 of any other competent evidence bearing upon the questions of whether the
27 defendant was under the influence of alcohol or other substances, in any

2 (4) (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, the fact that any person

4 use any substance, including alcohol, shall not constitute a defense against
5 any charge of violation of subsection (1) of this section.
6 (b) A laboratory test or tests for a controlled substance shall be inadmissible as
7 evidence in a prosecution under subsection (1)(d) of this section upon a
8 finding by the court that the defendant consumed the substance under a valid
9 prescription from a practitioner, as defined in KRS 218A.010, acting in the
