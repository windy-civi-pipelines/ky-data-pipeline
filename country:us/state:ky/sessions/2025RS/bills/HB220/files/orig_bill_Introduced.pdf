1 test or tests shall be inadmissible as evidence in a prosecution under
2 subsection (1)(a) or (f) of this section. The results of the test or tests, however,
3 may be admissible in a prosecution under subsection (1)(b) or (e) of this
4 section; or
5 (b) If the sample of the person's blood that is used to determine the presence of a

15 or breath shall give rise to the following presumptions:
16 (a) If there was an alcohol concentration of less than 0.04[ based upon the

18 that the defendant was not under the influence of alcohol; and
19 (b) If there was an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater but less than 0.08[
20 based upon the definition of alcohol concentration in KRS 189A.005], that

24 defendant.
25 The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed as limiting the introduction
26 of any other competent evidence bearing upon the questions of whether the
27 defendant was under the influence of alcohol or other substances, in any

5 any charge of violation of subsection (1) of this section.
6 (b) A laboratory test or tests for a controlled substance shall be inadmissible as
7 evidence in a prosecution under subsection (1)(d) of this section upon a
8 finding by the court that the defendant consumed the substance under a valid
9 prescription from a practitioner, as defined in KRS 218A.010, acting in the

11 controlled substance may be admissible as evidence in a prosecution under
