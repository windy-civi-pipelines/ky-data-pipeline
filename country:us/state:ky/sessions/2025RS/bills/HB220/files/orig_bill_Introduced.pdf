16 of a motor vehicle;
17 (e) While under the combined influence of alcohol and any other substance which

1 test or tests shall be inadmissible as evidence in a prosecution under
2 subsection (1)(a) or (f) of this section. The results of the test or tests, however,
3 may be admissible in a prosecution under subsection (1)(b) or (e) of this
4 section; or
5 (b) If the sample of the person's blood that is used to determine the presence of a
6 controlled substance was obtained more than two (2) hours after cessation of

13 motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, the alcohol concentration in the
14 defendant's blood as determined at the time of making analysis of his or her blood
15 or breath shall give rise to the following presumptions:
16 (a) If there was an alcohol concentration of less than 0.04[ based upon the
17 definition of alcohol concentration in KRS 189A.005], it shall be presumed
18 that the defendant was not under the influence of alcohol; and
19 (b) If there was an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater but less than 0.08[
20 based upon the definition of alcohol concentration in KRS 189A.005], that

24 defendant.
25 The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed as limiting the introduction
26 of any other competent evidence bearing upon the questions of whether the
27 defendant was under the influence of alcohol or other substances, in any

2 (4) (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, the fact that any person

5 any charge of violation of subsection (1) of this section.
6 (b) A laboratory test or tests for a controlled substance shall be inadmissible as
7 evidence in a prosecution under subsection (1)(d) of this section upon a
8 finding by the court that the defendant consumed the substance under a valid
9 prescription from a practitioner, as defined in KRS 218A.010, acting in the
10 course of his or her professional practice. However, a laboratory test for a
11 controlled substance may be admissible as evidence in a prosecution under
