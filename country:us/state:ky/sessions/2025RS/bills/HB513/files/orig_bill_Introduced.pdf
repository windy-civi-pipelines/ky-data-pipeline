10 (d) Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit a school district or district personnel

12 would believe, based on previous conduct and history, that the disclosure
13 would result in the child becoming a dependent child or an abused or
14 neglected child as defined in KRS 600.020. The fact that district personnel
15 withhold information from a parent under this subsection shall not in itself
16 constitute evidence of failure to report dependency, neglect, or abuse to the

19 being given to a child for research purposes, a school district shall provide the
20 student's parent with access to review the material and shall obtain parental consent.

17 biological sex not to be present in those circumstances;
18 (c) Allowing students to use restrooms, locker rooms, or shower rooms that are
19 reserved for students of a different biological sex:
20 1. Will create a significant potential for disruption of school activities and
21 unsafe conditions; and
22 2. Will create potential embarrassment, shame, and psychological injury to
23 students;
24 (d) Parents have a reasonable expectation that schools will not allow minor
25 children to be viewed in various states of undress by members of the opposite
26 biological sex, nor allow minor children to view members of the opposite sex

2 including the right not to be compelled to undress or be unclothed in the
3 presence of members of the opposite biological sex.
4 (3) Each local board of education or charter school board of directors shall, after
5 allowing public comment on the issue at an open meeting, adopt policies necessary
6 to protect the privacy rights outlined in subsection (2) of this section and enforce
7 this subsection. Those policies shall, at a minimum, not allow students to use
8 restrooms, locker rooms, or shower rooms that are reserved for students of a
9 different biological sex.]

19 or controlled use of faculty bathrooms, locker rooms, or shower rooms. Each local
20 board of education shall adopt policies and procedures to enforce this section.
