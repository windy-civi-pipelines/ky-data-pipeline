6 discriminate against an individual with respect to compensation, terms,
7 conditions, or privileges of employment, because of the individual's race,
8 color, religion, national origin, sex, weight, age forty (40) and over, because
9 the person is a qualified individual with a disability, or because the individual
10 is a smoker or nonsmoker, as long as the person complies with any workplace
11 policy concerning smoking;
12 (b) To limit, segregate, or classify employees in any way which would deprive or
13 tend to deprive an individual of employment opportunities or otherwise
14 adversely affect status as an employee, because of the individual's race, color,
15 religion, national origin, sex, weight, or age forty (40) and over, because the
16 person is a qualified individual with a disability, or because the individual is a

19 (c) To fail to make reasonable accommodations for any employee with
20 limitations related to pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition
21 who requests an accommodation, including but not limited to the need to

10 policy concerning smoking.
