[(3) In lieu of the annual audit requirements in subsection (1) of this section, a city with a population of more than

may elect to have an audit performed every other fiscal year to cover the two (2) fiscal years occurring since

requirements, or requirements of the Legislative Research Commission necessary to carry out the purposes of
KRS 6.955 to 6.975.
(8)[(9)] Each city shall, within thirty (30) days after the presentation of an audit to the city legislative body,

(b) The "Budgetary Comparison Schedules-Major Funds," which shall include the general fund and all
major funds;
(c) A statement that a copy of the complete audit report, including financial statements and supplemental

(d) A statement that any citizen may obtain from city hall a copy of the complete audit report, including
financial statements and supplemental information, for his or her personal use;
(e) A statement which notifies citizens requesting a personal copy of the city audit report that they will be

(f) A statement that copies of the financial statement prepared in accordance with KRS 424.220, when a
financial statement is required by KRS 424.220, are available to the public at no cost at the business

(9)[(10)] Any resident of the city or owner of real property within the city may bring an action in the Circuit
Court to enforce the provisions of this section. Any person who violates any provision of this section shall be
fined not less than fifty dollars ($50) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500). In addition, any officer who
fails to comply with any of the provisions of this section shall, for each failure, be subject to a forfeiture of not
less than fifty dollars ($50) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500), in the discretion of the court, which
may be recovered only once in a civil action brought by any resident of the city or owner of real property
within the city. The costs of all proceedings, including a reasonable fee for the attorney of the resident or
property owner bringing the action, shall be assessed against the unsuccessful party.
(10)[(11)] In the event of extenuating circumstances that prevent a city from completing and submitting a required
audit or financial statement in compliance with the applicable deadlines in subsections (1) to (3)[(4)] of this
section, the city may submit a written request for an extension of time to the Department for Local
Government on a form prescribed by the Department for Local Government. The Department for Local
Government shall approve the request if[ it is submitted on or before the applicable deadline and], in the
judgment of the Department for Local Government, the request is warranted by extenuating circumstances
beyond the control of the city or other factors that justify the city's noncompliance with the required
deadlines. The Department for Local Government may consider any evidence it deems appropriate,
including but not limited to proof of the city's progress towards compliance. Extensions granted under this
subsection shall not exceed eighteen (18)[nine (9)] months from the original due date of the audit or financial
statement. If the Department for Local Government approves an extension for a city and the city fails to
complete and submit the required audit or financial statement in compliance with that extended deadline, then
the provisions of subsection (11)[(12)] of this section shall apply.
(11)[(12)] If a city fails to complete an audit or financial statement and submit it to the Department for Local
Government as required in subsections (1) to (3)[(4)] and (10)[(11)] of this section, the Department for Local
Government shall notify the Finance and Administration Cabinet that the city has failed to comply with the
audit requirements of this section, and that any funds in the possession of any agency, entity, or branch of state
government shall be withheld from the city until further notice. The Department for Local Government shall
immediately notify the Finance and Administration Cabinet when the city complies with the requirements of
subsections (1) to (3)[(4)] and (10)[(11)] of this section for all prior fiscal years it has failed to comply with the
audit requirements of this section, and the Finance and Administration Cabinet shall direct the reinstatement of
payments to the city, including any funds that were withheld due to the noncompliance. This subsection shall
not be interpreted or construed to permit the state to withhold any nondiscretionary payments to a city that
are due the city for the provision of services by the city to the state or any of its agencies, including for the
use of city utilities.
(12)[(13)] Within a reasonable time after the completion of a special audit or examination conducted pursuant to
KRS 43.050, the Auditor shall bill the city for the actual expense of the audit or examination conducted. The
actual expense shall include the hours of work performed on the audit or examination as well as reasonable

to the city, county, or consolidated local government for the provision of services by the city, county, or
consolidated local government to the state or any of its agencies, including for the use of utility services.
(7) Notwithstanding KRS 67C.103(14)(e), a simple majority of the legislative council of a consolidated local

8 ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY
(5) The county treasurer shall, when required by the fiscal court, settle his or her accounts as county treasurer, and
within thirty (30) days after the close of each fiscal year, he or she shall, unless his immediate predecessor has
done so, make a full and complete settlement for the preceding fiscal year with the fiscal court or with a person
or persons whom the fiscal court, by order of record, appoints to make settlement with the county
treasurer[him]. In case of a vacancy, the county judge/executive shall call a special meeting which shall
proceed in the manner it deems proper to settle the accounts of the county treasurer.
(6) Payment of approved expenses may be made by means of electronic funds transfers from an authorized
account of the county. The signature requirement in subsection (1) of this section may be met via electronic
signature.
Section 8. KRS 68.275 is amended to read as follows:
(1) Claims against the county that are within the amount of line items of the county budget and arise pursuant to
contracts duly authorized by the fiscal court shall be paid by the county judge/executive by a warrant drawn on
the county and co-signed by the county treasurer.
(2) The county judge/executive shall present all claims to the fiscal court for review prior to payment and the
court, for good cause shown, may order that a claim not be paid.
(3) The fiscal court may adopt an order, called a standing order, to preapprove the payment of recurrent monthly
payroll and utility expenses and payments to vendors that regularly provide services to the county. No other
expenses shall be preapproved pursuant to this subsection without the written consent of the state local finance
officer. Notwithstanding KRS 68.020(1), payment of preapproved expenses may be made by means of
electronic funds transfers from an authorized account of the county without the cosignatures of the county
judge/executive and the county treasurer if approved by the fiscal court in a standing order, and if the fiscal
court has received the payee's prior written consent for the payment of funds by electronic funds transfer due
the payee. All standing orders adopted by the fiscal court shall be renewed annually and submitted to the state
local finance officer by July 1 of each fiscal year with the submission of the county budget if the fiscal court
wishes to continue the standing order. Otherwise, after July 1, the standing order shall expire, and no more
payments designated in the standing order shall be preapproved unless a new order is adopted by the fiscal
court according to the provisions of this subsection.
