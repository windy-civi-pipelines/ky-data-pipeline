15 relations in appropriate civil actions. The law of this state shall not be construed to
16 preclude the award of exemplary damages in any appropriate civil action relevant to
17 violations of this section. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the
18 common-law rights of parents.
19 (12) A minor upon whom an abortion is performed is not guilty of violating this section.

15 file, or have filed for him or her, that would suspend further execution of sentence.
16 Any court order granting or denying a motion to suspend further execution of
17 sentence is not reviewable.
18 (3) (a) During the period in which the defendant may file a motion pursuant to this
19 statute, the sentencing judge, within his or her discretion, may order that the

6 sentence shall not be probated under this section.[
7 (b) The sentence shall not be probated under this section if the defendant has been

20 an update of the comprehensive sex offender presentence evaluation of the
21 defendant conducted by the sex offender treatment program operated or approved
22 by the Department of Corrections or the Sex Offender Risk Assessment Advisory
23 Board. The comprehensive sex offender presentence evaluation shall provide to the
24 court a recommendation related to the risk of a repeat offense by the defendant and
25 the defendant's amenability to treatment, and shall be considered by the court in
26 determining whether to suspend the sentence. If the court suspends the sentence and

14 are handled in an expeditious and anonymous manner.
15 (b) The Supreme Court, through the Administrative Office of the Courts, shall
16 report by February 1 of each year to the Legislative Research Commission
17 and the cabinet on the number of petitions filed under subsection (3) of this
18 section for the preceding year, and the timing and manner of disposal of the
19 petition by each court. For each approved petition granting an abortion filed
20 under subsection (3) of this section, the specific court finding in subsection
21 (4) of this section shall be included in the report.
22 (9) (a) The requirements of subsections (2), (3), and (4) of this section shall not apply
23 when, in the best medical judgment of the physician based on the facts of the
24 case before him or her, a medical emergency exists that so complicates the
25 pregnancy as to require an immediate abortion.
26 (b) If a medical emergency exists, the physician shall make reasonable attempts,
27 whenever possible, and without endangering the minor, to contact the parent

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1373
1 or legal guardian of the minor, and may proceed, but must document reasons
2 for the medical necessity in the minor's medical records.
3 (c) The physician shall inform the parent or legal guardian, in person or by
4 telephone, within twenty-four (24) hours of the abortion, including details of
5 the medical emergency that necessitated the abortion without the parent's or
6 legal guardian's consent. The physician shall also provide this information in
7 writing to the parent or legal guardian at his or her last known address by
8 first-class mail or by certified mail, return receipt requested, with delivery
9 restricted to the parent or legal guardian.
10 (10) A report indicating the basis for any medical judgment that warrants failure to
11 obtain consent pursuant to this section shall be filed with the Cabinet for Health and
12 Family Services on a form supplied by the cabinet. This report shall be confidential.
13 (11) Failure to obtain consent pursuant to the requirements of this section is prima facie
14 evidence of failure to obtain informed consent and of interference with family
15 relations in appropriate civil actions. The law of this state shall not be construed to
16 preclude the award of exemplary damages in any appropriate civil action relevant to
17 violations of this section. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the
18 common-law rights of parents.
19 (12) A minor upon whom an abortion is performed is not guilty of violating this section.
20 Section 10. KRS 402.205 is amended to read as follows:
21 (1) A minor who is seventeen (17) years of age may petition the family court in the
22 county in which the minor resides, or the District Court in that county if a family

8 sufficient evidence to establish that the best interests of the minor would be served
9 by granting the petition for marriage.
10 (7) The granting of a petition for permission to marry filed under subsection (1) of this
11 section shall remove the disabilities of minority. A minor emancipated by the
12 petition shall be considered to have all the rights and responsibilities of an adult,
13 except for specific constitutional or statutory age requirements, including but not
14 limited to voting, the use of alcoholic beverages, and other health and safety
15 regulations relevant to him or her because of his or her age.
16 (8) The minor shall be advised by the court of the rights and responsibilities of parties
17 to a marriage and of emancipated minors. The minor shall be provided with a fact
18 sheet on these rights and responsibilities to be developed by the Office of the
19 Attorney General and the Cabinet for Health and Family Services. The fact sheet
20 shall include referral information for legal aid agencies in the Commonwealth and
21 national hotlines for domestic violence and sexual assault.
22 (9) The court may make any other orders that the court deems appropriate for the
23 minor's protection and may impose any other condition on the grant of the petition
24 that the court determines is reasonable under the circumstances for the minor's
25 protection.
26 (10) The court may set a fee not to exceed twenty dollars ($20) to file a petition for
27 permission to marry under this section.

2 (1) Subject to the provisions of KRS Chapter 439 and Chapters 500 to 534, any Circuit
3 Court may, upon motion of the defendant made not earlier than thirty (30) days nor
4 later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the defendant has been incarcerated
5 in a county jail following his or her conviction and sentencing pending delivery to
6 the institution to which he or she has been sentenced, or delivered to the keeper of
7 the institution to which he or she has been sentenced, suspend the further execution
8 of the sentence and place the defendant on probation upon terms the court
9 determines. Time spent on any form of release following conviction shall not count
10 toward time required under this section.
11 (2) The court shall consider any motion filed in accordance with subsection (1) of this
12 section within sixty (60) days of the filing date of that motion, and shall enter its
13 ruling within ten (10) days after considering the motion. The defendant may, in the
14 discretion of the trial court, have the right to a hearing on any motion he or she may
15 file, or have filed for him or her, that would suspend further execution of sentence.
16 Any court order granting or denying a motion to suspend further execution of
17 sentence is not reviewable.
18 (3) (a) During the period in which the defendant may file a motion pursuant to this
19 statute, the sentencing judge, within his or her discretion, may order that the
20 defendant be held in a local detention facility that is not at or above maximum
21 capacity until such time as the court rules on said motion. During this period
22 of detention, and prior to the court's ruling on said motion, the court may
23 require the defendant to participate in any approved community work program
24 or other forms of work release. Persons held in the county jail pursuant to this
25 subsection shall not be subject to transfer to a state correctional facility until
26 the decision is made not to place the petitioner on shock probation.
27 (b) The provisions concerning community work programs or other forms of work

2 and may be granted only after a hearing at which the Commonwealth's
3 attorney has the opportunity to present arguments in favor or opposition
4 thereto.
5 (4) [(a) ]If the defendant is a violent offender as defined in KRS 439.3401, the
6 sentence shall not be probated under this section.[
7 (b) The sentence shall not be probated under this section if the defendant has been
8 convicted of:
9 1. A violation of either KRS 507.040 or 507A.040 and a violation of KRS
10 189A.010 arising out of the same incident; or
11 2. A violation of either KRS 507.050 or 507A.050 and a violation of KRS
12 189A.010 arising out of the same incident.]
13 (5) If the defendant has been convicted of an offense under KRS 510.050, 510.080,
14 530.020, 530.064(1)(a), or 531.310, or criminal attempt to commit any of these
15 offenses under KRS 506.010, the sentence shall not be suspended, in accordance
16 with KRS 532.045.
17 (6) When a defendant has been convicted of a sex crime, as defined in KRS 17.500, the
18 court shall order a comprehensive sex offender presentence evaluation, unless one
19 has been provided within the past six (6) months, in which case the court may order
20 an update of the comprehensive sex offender presentence evaluation of the
21 defendant conducted by the sex offender treatment program operated or approved
22 by the Department of Corrections or the Sex Offender Risk Assessment Advisory
23 Board. The comprehensive sex offender presentence evaluation shall provide to the
24 court a recommendation related to the risk of a repeat offense by the defendant and
25 the defendant's amenability to treatment, and shall be considered by the court in
26 determining whether to suspend the sentence. If the court suspends the sentence and
27 places the defendant on probation, the provisions of KRS 532.045(3) to (7) shall

1 apply.
2 (7) The authority granted in this section shall be exercised by the judge who imposed
3 sentence on the defendant, unless he or she is unable to act and it appears that his or
4 her inability to act should continue beyond the expiration of the term of the court.
5 In such case, the judge who imposed sentence shall assign a judge to dispose of a
6 motion filed under this section, or as prescribed by the rules and practices
7 concerning the responsibility for disposition of criminal matters.
8 (8) The provisions of this section shall not apply where a sentence of death has been
9 imposed.

20 law is continued in effect for that purpose.

22 regulating abortion or abortion facilities are not repealed but are superseded to the extent
23 that those provisions may conflict with or may be inconsistent with Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
