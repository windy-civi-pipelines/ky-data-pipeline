1 from the board as a cosmetologist, esthetician, limited stylist, or nail technician and
2 who practice in salons licensed by the board shall be permitted to render services
3 outside of a fixed or mobile[an] establishment licensed by the board for pay, free,

7 (b) A person who is deceased and in the care of a funeral establishment; or

13 services authorized in subsection (3) of this section shall have the permission of the
