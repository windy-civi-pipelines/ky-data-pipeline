2 (1) (a) In determining the cost of the program to support education excellence in

8 of students graduating early under the provisions of KRS 158.142.

10 in average daily attendance in the district in the previous year, except a district shall
11 receive an amount equal to one-half (1/2) of the state portion of the average
12 statewide per pupil guaranteed base funding level for each student who graduated
13 early under the provisions of KRS 158.142. Each district's base funding level shall

15 (a) The number of at-risk students in the district. At-risk students shall be

5 as provided by KRS 157.370. Districts which contract to furnish
6 transportation to students attending nonpublic schools may adopt any payment
7 formula which ensures that no public school funds are used for the
8 transportation of nonpublic students.
9 (3) [Beginning with the 2015-2016 school year and each year thereafter, ]The General
10 Assembly shall annually allocate funds equal to one-half (1/2) of the state portion

2 shall not exceed the equivalent of one hundred fifty (150) pupil hours per day.
3 (c) The commissioner of education, upon approval of the Kentucky Board of
4 Education, shall adopt administrative regulations for enforcing this provision.
5 These administrative regulations shall include procedures for a superintendent
6 to request an exemption from the Kentucky Board of Education when unusual
7 circumstances warrant an increased class size for an individual class. A
8 request for an exemption shall include specific reasons for the increased class
9 size with a plan for reducing the class size prior to the beginning of the next
10 school year. A district shall not receive in any one (1) year exemptions for

19 child from achieving his or her individual education program in the least
20 restrictive environment.

22 shall be the average daily attendance upon which funding is appropriated for the

24 class size for combined classes. In combined classes other than the primary grades,

6 school district shall count as average daily attendance in a public school the time
7 that the child is in attendance at the school or agency, contingent upon approval by

9 (8) Pupils attending a center for child learning and study established under an
10 agreement pursuant to KRS 65.210 to 65.300 shall, for the purpose of calculating

12 which the child legally resides and which is party to the agreement. For purposes of
13 subsection (1) of this section, teachers who are actually employees of the joint or
14 cooperative action shall be considered as employees of each school district which is
15 a party to the agreement.
16 (9) Program funding shall be increased when the average daily attendance in any
17 district for the first two (2) months of the current school year is greater than the

19 school year. The program funds allotted the district shall be increased by the
20 percent of increase.[ The average daily attendance in kindergarten is the
21 kindergarten full-time equivalent pupils in average daily attendance.]
22 (10) If the average daily attendance for the current school year in any district decreases
23 by ten percent (10%) or more than the average daily attendance for the previous
24 school year, the average daily attendance for purposes of calculating program
25 funding for the next school year shall be increased by an amount equal to two-thirds
26 (2/3) of the decrease in average daily attendance. If the average daily attendance
27 remains the same or decreases in the succeeding school year, the average daily

1 attendance for purposes of calculating program funding for the following school
2 year shall be increased by an amount equal to one-third (1/3) of the decrease for the
3 first year of the decline.
4 (11) If the percentage of attendance of any school district shall have been reduced more
5 than two percent (2%) during the previous school year, the program funding
6 allotted the district for the current school year shall be increased by the difference in
7 the percentage of attendance for the two (2) years immediately prior to the current
