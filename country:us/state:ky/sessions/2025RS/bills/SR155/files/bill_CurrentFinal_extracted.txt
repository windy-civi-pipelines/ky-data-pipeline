2 Day.
3 WHEREAS, in March 1977, the General Assembly of the United Nations declared
4 March 8 as International Women's Day; and
5 WHEREAS, for more than four decades, International Women's Day has served as
6 a day of celebration for the profound accomplishments of women across the world; and
7 WHEREAS, International Women's Day also affirms that the more than three
8 billion women around the world have fundamental rights, participate in the political,
9 social, and economic lives of their communities, play a critical role in providing and
10 caring for their families, and contribute substantially to the economic growth of their
11 communities; and
12 WHEREAS, the 2025 campaign theme for International Women's Day is
13 "Accelerate Action," which emphasizes the importance of taking swift and decisive steps
14 to achieve gender equality and calls for increased momentum and urgency in addressing
15 the systematic barriers and biases that women face; and
16 WHEREAS, it is appropriate that all citizens in this Commonwealth acknowledge
17 the profound place women have in the overall vitality of Kentucky's economy, its culture,

20 they continue to exhibit excellence in their various leadership roles across the world,
21 including in this Commonwealth; and
22 WHEREAS, in 1921, this Commonwealth elected Mary Elliott Flanery to the
23 Kentucky General Assembly. Not only did she become the first woman ever elected to
24 the Kentucky House of Representatives, she also became the first woman elected to any
25 state legislature south of the Mason-Dixon line; and
26 WHEREAS, women around the world remain vastly underrepresented in
27 government positions, and 2024 data showed that women account for only 25.6 percent
