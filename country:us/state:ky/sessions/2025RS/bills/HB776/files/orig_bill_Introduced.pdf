1 AN ACT relating to benefits for Kentucky National Guard members.
2 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
3 Section 1. KRS 38.030 is amended to read as follows:
4 (1) Only the Governor shall have the authority to order units and members of the
5 Kentucky National Guard into state active duty.
6 (a) The Governor may order units and individual members of the Kentucky
7 National Guard into state active duty for any of the following purposes:
8 1. Protecting lives and property;
9 2. Assisting in disaster relief or other humanitarian efforts;
10 3. Preventing or suppressing riot or civil disorder;
11 4. Enforcing the laws of the Commonwealth; or
12 5. Other similar purpose.
13 (b) In addition to ordering personnel and units to state active duty, the Governor
14 may order other members of the Kentucky National Guard to participate in or
15 perform duty in support of state active duty missions notwithstanding the fact
16 that they are then entitled to receive federal pay and allowances pursuant to
17 Title 32 of the United States Code. The personnel may be ordered to perform
18 state active duty support missions either prior to, during, or after the time that
19 state active duty missions are planned or performed.
20 (c) Members of the National Guard who are ordered to perform duty as provided
21 in paragraph [subsection (1)](b) of this subsection[section] while they are
22 entitled to receive federal pay under Title 32 of the United States Code shall
23 have all of the powers, immunities, and benefits conferred by law upon
24 persons ordered to state active duty except that they shall receive no
25 additional pay for the duty and the provisions of KRS 38.235 shall not apply
26 to them. The powers, immunities, and benefits conferred upon those persons
27 shall be in addition to, and not in place of, those powers, immunities, and

1 benefits provided under federal law.
2 (d) Any member of the National Guard may, with his consent, be ordered to state
3 active duty without pay.
4 (e) Any member of the Kentucky National Guard who is not serving without
5 pay under paragraph (d) of this subsection shall be entitled to hazardous
6 duty incentive pay when called to active duty service under Title 32 of the
7 United States Code during a state of emergency as declared by the
8 Governor. The Department of Military Affairs shall determine and
9 implement reasonable personnel pay and classification rates for hazardous
10 duty incentive pay as described in this paragraph.
11 (2) The Governor may direct the commanding officer of the military forces ordered to
12 state active duty to report to any civil officer, including, but not limited to, judge,
13 county judge/executive, mayor, sheriff, or head of law enforcement or other public
14 agency in whose jurisdiction the state active duty mission is to be performed. The
15 civil officer may advise the commanding officer regarding the specific objectives to
16 be accomplished by the military force, but the tactical direction and disposition of
17 the troops and the particular means to be employed to accomplish the mission shall
18 be left solely to the commanding officer of the National Guard.
19 (3) Troops shall not be relieved from active field service except by order of the
20 Governor.
21 (4) National Guard officers, enlisted soldiers, and airmen who are temporarily or
22 permanently disabled as a direct result of an injury or disease arising out of the
23 performance of an act in the line of duty while on state active duty shall, at the
24 discretion of the Governor, remain on paid state active duty status until a competent
25 medical authority releases them to return to their normal activities or the Governor
26 deems it appropriate to relieve the individual from state active duty status.
27 Compensation paid to the soldier or airman by the department shall be adjusted and

2 compensation paid by the department shall be reduced by the amount of payments
3 received from workers' compensation insurance, Social Security benefits, and other
4 federal or state-financed disability programs designed to supplement the soldier's or
5 airman's income. Final compensation shall not be reduced by payments for medical
6 care.
