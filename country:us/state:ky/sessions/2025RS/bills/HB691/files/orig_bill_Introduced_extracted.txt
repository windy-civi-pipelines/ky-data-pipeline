8 standards and the methods for determining cost formulae for vendor payments
9 within each category of public assistance and other recipients shall be uniform for

11 limitations established by the Social Security Act and federal regulations. It shall
12 not be necessary that the amount of payments for units of services be uniform for
13 the entire state but amounts may vary from county to county and from city to city,
14 as well as among hospitals, based on the prevailing cost of medical care in each
15 locale and other local economic and geographic conditions, except that insofar as

27 registered nurse licensed pursuant to KRS Chapter 314 and acting under the

2 (8) (a) If payments made to community mental health centers, established pursuant to

5 used solely for the provision of other services to the intellectually disabled
6 through community mental health centers.
7 (b) Except as provided in KRS 210.370(4) and (5)(c), if a community mental
8 health center, established pursuant to KRS Chapter 210, provides services to a
9 recipient of Medical Assistance Program benefits outside of the community
10 mental health center's regional service area, as established in KRS 210.370,
11 the community mental health center shall not be reimbursed for such services
12 in accordance with the department's fee schedule for community mental
13 health centers but shall instead be reimbursed in accordance with the
14 department's fee schedule for behavioral health service organizations.
15 (c) As used in this subsection, "community mental health center" means a
16 regional community services program as defined in KRS 210.005.

20 under the provisions of the Medical Assistance Program solely on the basis of the
21 person's paying status as a Medicaid recipient. No person shall be removed or
22 discharged from any facility solely because they became eligible for participation in
23 the Medical Assistance Program, unless the facility can demonstrate the resident or
24 the resident's responsible party was fully notified in writing that the resident was
25 being admitted to a bed not certified for Medicaid reimbursement. No facility may
26 decertify a bed occupied by a Medicaid recipient or may decertify a bed that is
27 occupied by a resident who has made application for medical assistance.

1 the direction of a physician.
2 (b) Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, coverage under this
3 subsection may be subject, for each plan year, to a cap of twenty-five

6 low-protein modified foods.[ Each cap shall be subject to annual inflation
7 adjustments based on the consumer price index.]

9 or more supplements are compounded.
10 (3) (a) To the extent that coverage is not provided under subsection (2) of this
11 section or KRS 304.17A-139, a health benefit plan shall provide coverage

1 lactose intolerance, protein intolerance, food allergy, food sensitivity, or any other
2 condition or disease that is not an inborn error of metabolism or genetic condition].
3 (5) If the application of any requirement of this section would be the sole cause of a
4 health benefit plan's failure to qualify as a Health Savings Account-qualified
5 High Deductible Health Plan under 26 U.S.C. sec. 223, as amended, then the
6 requirement shall not apply to that health benefit plan until the minimum
7 deductible under 26 U.S.C. sec. 223, as amended, is satisfied.
8 (6) Notwithstanding KRS 304.17A-099 and any other provision of this chapter, if the
9 application of any requirement of this section to a qualified health plan, as

12 requirement under 42 U.S.C. sec. 18031(d)(3) and 45 C.F.R. sec. 155.170, as
13 amended, then the requirement shall not apply to the qualified health plan until

23 health plan coverage as defined in 45 C.F.R. sec. 147.140(a), as

27 Gynecologists.

16 (5) No payment of premium by any department, board, agency, public postsecondary
