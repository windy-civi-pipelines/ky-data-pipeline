11 3. Except for retrospective review, a description of alternative benefits,
12 services, or supplies covered by the health benefit plan, if any; and
13 4. Instructions for initiating an external review of an adverse
14 determination, or filing a request for review with the department if a
15 coverage denial is upheld by the insurer on internal appeal.
16 (4) (a) The department shall establish and maintain a system for receiving and
17 reviewing requests for review of coverage denials from covered persons,
18 authorized persons, and providers.
19 (b) For purposes of this subsection, "coverage denials" shall not include an

21 arising from an adverse determination.
22 (c) On receipt of a written request for review of a coverage denial from a covered
23 person, authorized person, or provider, the department shall notify the insurer
24 which issued the denial of the request for review and shall call for the insurer

26 business days of receipt of notice to the insurer.
27 (d) Within ten (10) business days of receiving the notice of the request for review

1 from the department, the insurer shall provide to the department the following
2 information:

4 service for which coverage was denied was a covered person under a
5 health benefit plan issued by the insurer on the date the service was
6 sought or denied;
7 2. Confirmation as to whether the covered person, authorized person, or
8 provider has exhausted his or her rights under the insurer's appeal
9 process under this section; and
10 3. The reason for the coverage denial, including the specific limitation or

15 provide to the department any information requested by the department that is
16 germane to its review.
17 (f) 1. On the receipt of the information described in paragraphs (d) and (e) of
18 this subsection, unless the department is not able to do so because
19 making a determination requires resolution of a medical issue, it shall
20 determine whether the service, treatment, drug, or device is specifically
21 limited or excluded under the terms of the covered person's health
22 benefit plan.
23 2. If the department determines that the treatment, service, drug, or device
24 is not specifically limited or excluded, it shall so notify the insurer, and
25 the insurer shall either cover the service, or afford the covered person an
26 opportunity for external review under KRS 304.17A-621, 304.17A-623,
27 and 304.17A-625, where the conditions precedent to the review are

1 present.
2 3. If the department notifies the insurer that the treatment, service, drug, or
3 device is specifically limited or excluded in the health benefit plan, the
4 insurer is not required to cover the service or afford the covered person
5 an external review.
6 (g) An insurer shall be required to cover the treatment, service, drug, or device
7 that was denied or provide notification of the right to external review in
8 accordance with paragraph (f) of this subsection whether the covered person
9 has disenrolled or remains enrolled with the insurer.
10 (h) If the covered person has disenrolled with the insurer, the insurer shall only be
11 required to provide the treatment, service, drug, or device that was denied for
12 a period not to exceed thirty (30) days or provide the covered person the
13 opportunity for external review.
14 Section 5. KRS 304.17A-607 is amended to read as follows:
