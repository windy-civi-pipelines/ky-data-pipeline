of the covered person or the unborn child in serious jeopardy;
b. Serious impairment to bodily functions; or
c. Serious dysfunction of a bodily organ or part;

agent that denies, limits, reduces, or terminates coverage for a treatment, procedure, drug, or device for
a covered person shall provide the covered person, authorized person, or provider acting on behalf of
the covered person with an internal appeal determination letter that shall include:
1. A statement of the specific medical and scientific reasons for denying coverage or identifying
that provision of the schedule of benefits or exclusions that demonstrates that coverage is not

covered by the health benefit plan, if any; and

person, or provider, the department shall notify the insurer which issued the denial of the request for
review and shall call for the insurer to respond to the department regarding the request for review within
ten (10) business days of receipt of notice to the insurer.
(d) Within ten (10) business days of receiving the notice of the request for review from the department, the
insurer shall provide to the department the following information:
1. Confirmation as to whether the person who received or sought the health service for which
coverage was denied was a covered person under a health benefit plan issued by the insurer on
the date the service was sought or denied;

or her rights under the insurer's appeal process under this section; and
3. The reason for the coverage denial, including the specific limitation or exclusion of the health
benefit plan demonstrating that coverage is not available.
(e) In addition to the information described in paragraph (d) of this subsection, the insurer and the covered
person, authorized person, or provider shall provide to the department any information requested by the
department that is germane to its review.
(f) 1. On the receipt of the information described in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this subsection, unless
the department is not able to do so because making a determination requires resolution of a
medical issue, it shall determine whether the service, treatment, drug, or device is specifically
limited or excluded under the terms of the covered person's health benefit plan.
2. If the department determines that the treatment, service, drug, or device is not specifically limited
or excluded, it shall so notify the insurer, and the insurer shall either cover the service, or afford
the covered person an opportunity for external review under KRS 304.17A-621, 304.17A-623,
and 304.17A-625, where the conditions precedent to the review are present.

limited or excluded in the health benefit plan, the insurer is not required to cover the service or
afford the covered person an external review.

notification of the right to external review in accordance with paragraph (f) of this subsection whether
the covered person has disenrolled or remains enrolled with the insurer.
(h) If the covered person has disenrolled with the insurer, the insurer shall only be required to provide the
treatment, service, drug, or device that was denied for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days or provide
the covered person the opportunity for external review.
