CHAPTER 121 1
CHAPTER 121
( HB 90 )
WHEREAS, the right to life is the most fundamental human right, forming the basis for all other rights, as
recognized in the principles of natural law, the Constitution of the United States, and the Constitution of Kentucky;
and
WHEREAS, appropriate and comprehensive perinatal care is essential for ensuring the health and well-being
of both the mother and the unborn child, encompassing prenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum care to optimize health
outcomes and address potential complications; and
WHEREAS, all childbearing women and families have the right to receive comprehensive, evidence-based
information regarding their perinatal care and birth setting options; and
WHEREAS, accredited freestanding birth centers follow established standards of care, ensuring high-quality,
evidence-based maternity services while maintaining collaborative relationships with hospitals and medical providers
for seamless transfer when necessary; and
WHEREAS, freestanding birth centers provide a safe and regulated alternative for maternity care, offering a
medically directed care, midwifery-led model that emphasizes holistic, patient-centered care; and
WHEREAS, elective abortion restrictions under Kentucky law, as enacted, include medically necessary
exceptions and interventions required to preserve the life of the mother; and
WHEREAS, there is a need to clarify the distinction between an elective abortion and illegal termination of the
life of an unborn child protected under Kentucky law and medically necessary interventions that affirm the
fundamental right to life, ensure compassionate and comprehensive care for mothers and unborn children that are
appropriate medical management for serious and life-threatening perinatal medical complications such as
spontaneous miscarriage, or to treat conditions such as ectopic and molar pregnancies; and
WHEREAS, lifesaving miscarriage management, including medical procedures necessary to address
spontaneous abortion, also known as miscarriage, inevitable abortion, or incomplete abortion, is an essential
component of comprehensive medical care and is distinct from elective abortion; and
WHEREAS, medical conditions such as ectopic pregnancy, molar pregnancy, sepsis, and hemorrhage may
necessitate emergency interventions to prevent maternal death or serious and permanent impairment of a life-
sustaining organ; and
WHEREAS, in cases where a pregnancy has ended, or is in the unavoidable and untreatable process of ending,
it is necessary to provide appropriate consultation and medical care, including the removal of a deceased unborn child
from the uterine cavity when no fetal cardiac activity is present; and
WHEREAS, lifesaving miscarriage management refers to medically necessary interventions performed by
healthcare professionals to protect the life of a pregnant woman experiencing a spontaneous pregnancy loss or a life-
threatening pregnancy complication, distinguishing these interventions from elective abortion as these interventions
are intended solely to address natural pregnancy complications where the unborn child has already died, the
pregnancy is no longer viable, or to prevent the death or substantial risk of death to the pregnant woman due to a
physical condition, or to prevent the serious, permanent impairment of a life-sustaining organ of a pregnant woman;
and
WHEREAS, stillbirth, early fetal demise, and the death of an unborn child have many causes, including
perinatal and intrapartum complications, hypertension, diabetes, infection, congenital and genetic abnormalities,
placental dysfunction, and pregnancy continuing beyond 40 weeks and are catastrophic events with lasting
consequences on the expectant mother, family, and all of society; and
WHEREAS, initiatives such as Kentucky Perinatal Quality Collaborative (KyPQC), formed in 2019 as a
statewide network working in collaboration with healthcare providers, delivery hospitals, insurers, advocacy groups,
and state and national stakeholders, demonstrate an ongoing commitment to improve the quality of care during
pregnancy, delivery, and throughout the first year of a child's life in the Commonwealth; and

2 ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY
WHEREAS, perinatal palliative care programs provide essential support and resources to pregnant women and
families facing complex and life-limiting prenatal diagnoses, ensuring compassionate care, informed decision-
making, and emotional, spiritual, and medical guidance; and
WHEREAS, hospitals, birthing centers, maternal-fetal specialists, and midwives have a shared responsibility
to offer or refer patients to perinatal palliative care programs and support services when a prenatal diagnosis indicates
that a baby may die before or after birth, or when a newborn is diagnosed with a life-limiting condition; and
WHEREAS, the Cabinet for Health and Family Services should maintain a list of perinatal palliative care
programs and providers to ensure accessibility and awareness among healthcare professionals and expectant families;
and
WHEREAS, the 2024 committee opinion of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists'
Committee on Obstetric Practice and Ethics expresses support for perinatal palliative care as a coordinated care
strategy that comprises options for obstetric and newborn care that include a focus on maximizing quality of life and
comfort for newborns with a variety of conditions considered to be life-limiting in early infancy and a dual focus on
ameliorating suffering and honoring patient values, perinatal palliative care provided concurrently with life-
prolonging treatment; and
WHEREAS, the 2024 committee opinion of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists'
Committee on Obstetric Practice and Ethics states that the birth plan is an individualized proposal for delivery and
neonatal care and a critical prenatal component of perinatal palliative comfort care; and
WHEREAS, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine endorsed the
2024 committee opinion on perinatal palliative care of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists'
committees;

Raw Text:
CHAPTER 121 1
CHAPTER 121
( HB 90 )
AN ACT relating to maternal health and declaring an emergency.
WHEREAS, the right to life is the most fundamental human right, forming the basis for all other rights, as
recognized in the principles of natural law, the Constitution of the United States, and the Constitution of Kentucky;
and
WHEREAS, appropriate and comprehensive perinatal care is essential for ensuring the health and well-being
of both the mother and the unborn child, encompassing prenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum care to optimize health
outcomes and address potential complications; and
WHEREAS, all childbearing women and families have the right to receive comprehensive, evidence-based
information regarding their perinatal care and birth setting options; and
WHEREAS, accredited freestanding birth centers follow established standards of care, ensuring high-quality,
evidence-based maternity services while maintaining collaborative relationships with hospitals and medical providers
for seamless transfer when necessary; and
WHEREAS, freestanding birth centers provide a safe and regulated alternative for maternity care, offering a
medically directed care, midwifery-led model that emphasizes holistic, patient-centered care; and
WHEREAS, elective abortion restrictions under Kentucky law, as enacted, include medically necessary
exceptions and interventions required to preserve the life of the mother; and
WHEREAS, there is a need to clarify the distinction between an elective abortion and illegal termination of the
life of an unborn child protected under Kentucky law and medically necessary interventions that affirm the
fundamental right to life, ensure compassionate and comprehensive care for mothers and unborn children that are
appropriate medical management for serious and life-threatening perinatal medical complications such as
spontaneous miscarriage, or to treat conditions such as ectopic and molar pregnancies; and
WHEREAS, lifesaving miscarriage management, including medical procedures necessary to address
spontaneous abortion, also known as miscarriage, inevitable abortion, or incomplete abortion, is an essential
component of comprehensive medical care and is distinct from elective abortion; and
WHEREAS, medical conditions such as ectopic pregnancy, molar pregnancy, sepsis, and hemorrhage may
necessitate emergency interventions to prevent maternal death or serious and permanent impairment of a life-
sustaining organ; and
WHEREAS, in cases where a pregnancy has ended, or is in the unavoidable and untreatable process of ending,
it is necessary to provide appropriate consultation and medical care, including the removal of a deceased unborn child
from the uterine cavity when no fetal cardiac activity is present; and
WHEREAS, lifesaving miscarriage management refers to medically necessary interventions performed by
healthcare professionals to protect the life of a pregnant woman experiencing a spontaneous pregnancy loss or a life-
threatening pregnancy complication, distinguishing these interventions from elective abortion as these interventions
are intended solely to address natural pregnancy complications where the unborn child has already died, the
pregnancy is no longer viable, or to prevent the death or substantial risk of death to the pregnant woman due to a
physical condition, or to prevent the serious, permanent impairment of a life-sustaining organ of a pregnant woman;
and
WHEREAS, stillbirth, early fetal demise, and the death of an unborn child have many causes, including
perinatal and intrapartum complications, hypertension, diabetes, infection, congenital and genetic abnormalities,
placental dysfunction, and pregnancy continuing beyond 40 weeks and are catastrophic events with lasting
consequences on the expectant mother, family, and all of society; and
WHEREAS, initiatives such as Kentucky Perinatal Quality Collaborative (KyPQC), formed in 2019 as a
statewide network working in collaboration with healthcare providers, delivery hospitals, insurers, advocacy groups,
and state and national stakeholders, demonstrate an ongoing commitment to improve the quality of care during
pregnancy, delivery, and throughout the first year of a child's life in the Commonwealth; and
Legislative Research Commission PDF Version

2 ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY
WHEREAS, perinatal palliative care programs provide essential support and resources to pregnant women and
families facing complex and life-limiting prenatal diagnoses, ensuring compassionate care, informed decision-
making, and emotional, spiritual, and medical guidance; and
WHEREAS, hospitals, birthing centers, maternal-fetal specialists, and midwives have a shared responsibility
to offer or refer patients to perinatal palliative care programs and support services when a prenatal diagnosis indicates
that a baby may die before or after birth, or when a newborn is diagnosed with a life-limiting condition; and
WHEREAS, the Cabinet for Health and Family Services should maintain a list of perinatal palliative care
programs and providers to ensure accessibility and awareness among healthcare professionals and expectant families;
and
WHEREAS, the 2024 committee opinion of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists'
Committee on Obstetric Practice and Ethics expresses support for perinatal palliative care as a coordinated care
strategy that comprises options for obstetric and newborn care that include a focus on maximizing quality of life and
comfort for newborns with a variety of conditions considered to be life-limiting in early infancy and a dual focus on
ameliorating suffering and honoring patient values, perinatal palliative care provided concurrently with life-
prolonging treatment; and
WHEREAS, the 2024 committee opinion of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists'
Committee on Obstetric Practice and Ethics states that the birth plan is an individualized proposal for delivery and
neonatal care and a critical prenatal component of perinatal palliative comfort care; and
WHEREAS, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine endorsed the
2024 committee opinion on perinatal palliative care of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists'
committees;

transfer of a patient; and
2. Establishing the freestanding birthing center’s responsibility for:
a. Notifying the receiving hospital promptly of the impending transfer of a patient; and
b. Arranging for appropriate and safe transportation.
(b) The cabinet shall establish a process and criteria by which the requirement of paragraph (a) of this
subsection may be waived if a freestanding birthing center submits to the cabinet evidence of a
failure by a hospital that provides obstetric services to enter into a written patient transfer agreement
with the freestanding birthing center.
(6) (a) A freestanding birthing center shall have a written patient transfer agreement with a licensed
emergency medical transportation service.
(b) The cabinet shall establish a process and criteria by which the requirement of paragraph (a) of this
subsection may be waived if a freestanding birthing center submits to the cabinet evidence of a
failure by a licensed emergency medical transportation service to enter into a written patient transfer
agreement with the freestanding birthing center.
(7) A certificate of need shall not be required to establish and license a freestanding birthing center with no
more than four (4) beds.
(8) (a) Nothing in this section is intended to expand or limit the liability of a health care provider, health
care facility, or freestanding birthing center.
(b) In the event of an action for injury or death due to any act or omission of a health care provider
rendering services at a freestanding birthing center from which an injured patient is transferred to
any other licensed health care provider or licensed health care facility:
1. The liability of the subsequent licensed health care provider or licensed health care facility
shall be limited to their own negligent acts and omissions that violate their standards of care
according to existing law, except as provided in subparagraph 2. of this paragraph; and
2. If the subsequent licensed health care provider or licensed health care facility owns, operates,
or provides care at the freestanding birthing center from which the injured patient was
transferred, then the licensed health care provider or licensed health care facility shall be
liable for acts or omissions that violate their standards of care and that occurred at the
freestanding birthing center.
