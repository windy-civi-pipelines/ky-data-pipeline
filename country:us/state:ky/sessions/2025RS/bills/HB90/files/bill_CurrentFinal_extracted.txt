1 AN ACT relating to maternal health and declaring an emergency.
2 WHEREAS, the right to life is the most fundamental human right, forming the basis
3 for all other rights, as recognized in the principles of natural law, the Constitution of the
4 United States, and the Constitution of Kentucky; and
5 WHEREAS, appropriate and comprehensive perinatal care is essential for ensuring
6 the health and well-being of both the mother and the unborn child, encompassing
7 prenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum care to optimize health outcomes and address
8 potential complications; and
9 WHEREAS, all childbearing women and families have the right to receive
10 comprehensive, evidence-based information regarding their perinatal care and birth
11 setting options; and
12 WHEREAS, accredited freestanding birth centers follow established standards of
13 care, ensuring high-quality, evidence-based maternity services while maintaining
14 collaborative relationships with hospitals and medical providers for seamless transfer
15 when necessary; and
16 WHEREAS, freestanding birth centers provide a safe and regulated alternative for
17 maternity care, offering a medically directed care, midwifery-led model that emphasizes
18 holistic, patient-centered care; and
19 WHEREAS, elective abortion restrictions under Kentucky law, as enacted, include
20 medically necessary exceptions and interventions required to preserve the life of the
21 mother; and
22 WHEREAS, there is a need to clarify the distinction between an elective abortion
23 and illegal termination of the life of an unborn child protected under Kentucky law and
24 medically necessary interventions that affirm the fundamental right to life, ensure

1 molar pregnancies; and
2 WHEREAS, lifesaving miscarriage management, including medical procedures
3 necessary to address spontaneous abortion, also known as miscarriage, inevitable
4 abortion, or incomplete abortion, is an essential component of comprehensive medical
5 care and is distinct from elective abortion; and
6 WHEREAS, medical conditions such as ectopic pregnancy, molar pregnancy,
7 sepsis, and hemorrhage may necessitate emergency interventions to prevent maternal
8 death or serious and permanent impairment of a life-sustaining organ; and
9 WHEREAS, in cases where a pregnancy has ended, or is in the unavoidable and
10 untreatable process of ending, it is necessary to provide appropriate consultation and
11 medical care, including the removal of a deceased unborn child from the uterine cavity
12 when no fetal cardiac activity is present; and
13 WHEREAS, lifesaving miscarriage management refers to medically necessary
14 interventions performed by healthcare professionals to protect the life of a pregnant
15 woman experiencing a spontaneous pregnancy loss or a life-threatening pregnancy
16 complication, distinguishing these interventions from elective abortion as these
17 interventions are intended solely to address natural pregnancy complications where the
18 unborn child has already died, the pregnancy is no longer viable, or to prevent the death
19 or substantial risk of death to the pregnant woman due to a physical condition, or to
20 prevent the serious, permanent impairment of a life-sustaining organ of a pregnant
21 woman; and
22 WHEREAS, stillbirth, early fetal demise, and the death of an unborn child have
23 many causes, including perinatal and intrapartum complications, hypertension, diabetes,
24 infection, congenital and genetic abnormalities, placental dysfunction, and pregnancy
25 continuing beyond 40 weeks and are catastrophic events with lasting consequences on the
26 expectant mother, family, and all of society; and
27 WHEREAS, initiatives such as Kentucky Perinatal Quality Collaborative (KyPQC),

9 spiritual, and medical guidance; and
10 WHEREAS, hospitals, birthing centers, maternal-fetal specialists, and midwives

2 2. Participation in the quality review functions of the freestanding
3 birthing center, including review of transfers and sentinel events.
4 (b) The cabinet shall establish a timeline for a freestanding birthing center to
5 fill the position of medical director if the position becomes vacant.
6 (4) A freestanding birthing center shall obtain written informed consent for each
7 client receiving care. The written informed consent shall include:
8 (a) A description of the benefits, risks, and eligibility requirements for receiving
9 care at the freestanding birthing center;
10 (b) A description of the education and credentials of practitioners providing
11 clinical care at the freestanding birthing center;

21 for professional collaboration with other care providers.
22 (5) (a) A freestanding birthing center shall have a written patient transfer
23 agreement with a hospital that provides obstetric services. The cabinet shall
24 establish minimum requirements for the patient transfer agreement which
25 shall include:
