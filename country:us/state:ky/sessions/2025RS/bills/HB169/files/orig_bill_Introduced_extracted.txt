27 education to make changes in school district divisions as are necessary to

4 provisions of subsection (2) of this section. No person whose registration status is
5 as a registered member of a political party shall be eligible for an[to] election as an
6 independent, or political organization, or political group candidate, nor shall any
7 person be eligible for an[to] election as an independent, or political organization, or

9 political party on January 1 immediately preceding the regular election for which
10 the person seeks to be a candidate. This restriction shall not apply to candidates to

14 counted as a petitioner for the candidate whose petition is filed first, except a
15 petitioner for the nomination of candidates for soil and water conservation district

24 candidate by certified mail within twenty-four (24) hours of filing.
25 (5) A judge who elected to retire as a Senior Status Special Judge in accordance with

1 AN ACT relating to school board elections.
2 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
3 Section 1. KRS 160.200 is amended to read as follows:
4 (1) All elections for members of county and independent boards of education shall be
5 partisan and occur in even[ ]-numbered years, for a term of four (4) years, except
6 as provided in KRS 160.210(5)[. Except as provided in subsection (3) of this
7 section, the elections shall be held at the regular November election].
8 (2) For county boards of education, a petition shall be required for the nomination of
9 candidates in accordance with Section 12 of this Act.
10 (3) (a) For independent boards of education, candidates shall not participate in a
11 primary, but shall be required to file a petition of nomination in accordance
12 with Section 12 of this Act.
13 (b) Any vote cast for all candidates of one (1) party or for one (1) or more
14 candidates of every party having candidates entitled to be voted for, or for
15 one (1) or more independent, political organization, or political group
16 candidates, shall not be counted for, or assigned to, any candidate for a
17 member seat on an independent board of education, even if that candidate is
18 the only designee of a political party, organization, or group nominated to
19 fill a member seat on an independent board of education.
20 (c) The order of the names of the candidates for independent school districts to
21 appear on the regular election ballot shall be determined by lot, if there is
22 more than one (1) candidate for the office sought who is the same political
23 affiliation.
24 (4) In each even numbered year, there shall be held an election in every county and
25 independent district to fill the membership of the boards of education for the terms
26 that will expire on the first Monday in January following, and the regularly elected
27 members shall hold office for four (4) years and until their successors are elected

1 and have qualified.[
2 (3) Any independent school district embracing a designated city may, at the discretion
3 of its board of education, hold its election of board members at its public school
4 building on the first Saturday in May. The election shall be held by three (3)
5 officers appointed by the board of education and the expenses of the election shall
6 be paid from the treasury of the school district. In all other respects the provisions
7 of this chapter relating to holding elections for board members shall apply.]
8 (5)[(4)] In counties containing a city of the first class, wherein a merger pursuant to
9 KRS 160.041 shall have been accomplished, the terms of the members shall be as
10 provided in KRS 160.210(5). Elected members of such boards, excepting those
11 boards of education representing ten percent (10%) or less of the student population
12 of the county serving at the effective date of such a merger shall continue to serve
13 until their term expires, but no appointments shall be made to fill vacancies. The
14 terms of office of members of boards of education representing ten percent (10%)
15 or less of the student population of the county shall expire on the effective date of
16 the merger.
17 (6)[(5)] As used in this section, "designated city" means a city classified as a city of
18 the fifth class as of January 1, 2014, under the city classification system in effect
19 prior to January 1, 2015. The Department of Education shall[, on or before January
20 1, 2015,] create an official registry listing the cities that qualify as a "designated

22 Section 2. KRS 160.210 is amended to read as follows:
23 (1) In independent school districts, the members of the school board shall be elected
24 from the district at large. In county school districts, members shall be elected from
25 divisions. For either type of school district, candidate names with corresponding
26 emblems of a political party shall be presented to the voters on the respective
27 ballot for the office sought.

1 (2) The board of education of each county school district shall, not later than July 1,
2 1940, divide its district into five (5) divisions containing integral voting precincts
3 and as equal in population insofar as is practicable. In first dividing the county
4 district into divisions the board shall, if more than one (1) of its members reside in
5 one (1) division, determine by lot which member from that division shall represent
6 that division, and which members shall represent the divisions in which no member
7 resides. The members so determined to represent divisions in which no member
8 resides shall be considered the members from those divisions until their terms
9 expire, and thereafter the members from those divisions shall be nominated and
10 elected as provided in KRS 160.200,[ and] 160.220 , 160.230, and 160.240[to
11 160.250].
12 (3) Any changes made in division boundary lines shall be to make divisions as equal in
13 population and containing integral voting precincts insofar as is practical. No
14 change may be made in division boundary lines less than five (5) years after the last
15 change in any division lines, except in case of merger of districts, a change in
16 territory due to annexation, or to allow compliance with KRS 117.055(2).
17 (4) (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (3) of this section, if one
18 hundred (100) residents of a county school district division petition the
19 Kentucky Board of Education stating that the school district divisions are not
20 divided as nearly equal in population as can reasonably be expected, the chief
21 state school officer shall cause an investigation to determine the validity of the
22 petition, the investigation to be completed within thirty (30) days after receipt
23 of the petition.
24 (b) If the investigation reveals the school district to be unequally divided
25 according to population, the Kentucky Board of Education, upon the
26 recommendation of the chief state school officer, shall order the local board of
27 education to make changes in school district divisions as are necessary to

1 equalize population within the five (5) school divisions.
2 (c) If any board fails to comply with the order of the Kentucky Board of
3 Education within thirty (30) days or prior to August 1 in any year in which
4 any members of the board are to be elected, members shall be elected from
5 the district at large until the order of the Kentucky Board of Education has
6 been complied with.
