1 AN ACT relating to relative and fictive kin caregivers.
2 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
3 ïƒ¢Section 1. KRS 605.120 is amended to read as follows:
4 (1) The cabinet is authorized to expend available funds to provide for the board,
5 lodging, and care of children who would otherwise be placed in foster care or who
6 are placed by the cabinet in a foster home or boarding home, or may arrange for
7 payments or contributions by any local governmental unit, or public or private
8 agency or organization, willing to make payments or contributions for such
9 purpose. The cabinet may accept any gift, devise, or bequest made to it for its
10 purposes.
11 (2) The cabinet shall establish a reimbursement system, within existing appropriation
12 amounts, for foster parents that comes as close as possible to meeting the actual
13 cost of caring for foster children. The cabinet shall consider providing additional
14 reimbursement for foster parents who obtain additional training, and foster parents
15 who have served for an extended period of time. In establishing a reimbursement
16 system, the cabinet shall, to the extent possible within existing appropriation
17 amounts, address the additional cost associated with providing care to children with
18 exceptional needs.
19 (3) The cabinet shall review reimbursement rates paid to foster parents and shall issue a
20 report upon request comparing the rates paid by Kentucky to the figures presented
21 in the Expenditures on Children by Families Annual Report prepared by the United
22 States Department of Agriculture and the rates paid to foster parents by other states.
23 To the extent that funding is available, reimbursement rates paid to foster parents
24 shall be increased on an annual basis to reflect cost of living increases.
25 (4) The cabinet is encouraged to develop pilot projects both within the state system and
26 in collaboration with private child caring agencies to test alternative delivery
27 systems and nontraditional funding mechanisms.
