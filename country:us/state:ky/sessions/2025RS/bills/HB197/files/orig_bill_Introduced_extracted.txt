1 AN ACT relating to higher education.
2 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
3 ïƒ¢Section 1. KRS 164.020 is amended to read as follows:
4 In addition to the powers and responsibilities established in Section 3 of this Act, the
5 Kentucky Higher Education Assistance Authority[Council on Postsecondary Education
6 in Kentucky] shall:
7 (1) Develop and implement the strategic agenda with the advice and counsel of the
8 Strategic Committee on Postsecondary Education. The authority[council] shall
9 provide for and direct the planning process and subsequent strategic implementation
10 plans based on the strategic agenda as provided in KRS 164.0203;
11 (2) Revise the strategic agenda and strategic implementation plan with the advice and
12 counsel of the committee as set forth in KRS 164.004;
13 (3) Develop a system of public accountability related to the strategic agenda by
14 evaluating the performance and effectiveness of the state's postsecondary system.
15 The authority[council] shall prepare a report in conjunction with the accountability
16 reporting described in KRS 164.095, which shall be submitted to the committee, the
17 Governor, and the General Assembly by December 1 annually. This report shall
18 include a description of contributions by postsecondary institutions to the quality of
19 elementary and secondary education in the Commonwealth;
20 (4) Review, revise, and approve the missions of the state's universities and the
21 Kentucky Community and Technical College System. The Kentucky Higher
22 Education Assistance Authority[Council on Postsecondary Education] shall have
23 the final authority to determine the compliance of postsecondary institutions with
24 their academic, service, and research missions;
25 (5) Establish and ensure that all postsecondary institutions in Kentucky cooperatively
26 provide for an integrated system of postsecondary education. The
27 authority[council] shall guard against inappropriate and unnecessary conflict and

1 duplication by promoting transferability of credits and easy access of information
2 among institutions;
3 (6) Engage in analyses and research to determine the overall needs of postsecondary
4 education and adult education in the Commonwealth;
5 (7) Develop plans that may be required by federal legislation. The authority[council]
6 shall for all purposes of federal legislation relating to planning be considered the
7 "single state agency" as that term may be used in federal legislation. When federal
8 legislation requires additional representation on any "single state agency," the
9 Kentucky Higher Education Assistance Authority[Council on Postsecondary
10 Education] shall establish advisory groups necessary to satisfy federal legislative or
11 regulatory guidelines;
12 (8) (a) Determine tuition and approve the minimum qualifications for admission to
13 the state postsecondary educational system. In defining residency, the
14 authority[council] shall classify a student as having Kentucky residency if the
15 student met the residency requirements at the beginning of his or her last year
16 in high school and enters a Kentucky postsecondary education institution
17 within two (2) years of high school graduation. In determining the tuition for
18 non-Kentucky residents, the authority[council] shall consider the fees
19 required of Kentucky students by institutions in adjoining states, the resident
20 fees charged by other states, the total actual per student cost of training in the
21 institutions for which the fees are being determined, and the ratios of
22 Kentucky students to non-Kentucky students comprising the enrollments of
23 the respective institutions, and other factors the authority[council] may in its
24 sole discretion deem pertinent, except that the Kentucky Community and
25 Technical College System may assess a mandatory student fee not to exceed
26 eight dollars ($8) per credit hour to be used exclusively for debt service on
27 amounts not to exceed seventy-five percent (75%) of the total projects cost of

1 the Kentucky Community and Technical College System agency bond
2 projects included in 2014 Ky. Acts ch. 117, Part II, J., 11.
3 (b) The Kentucky Community and Technical College System mandatory fee
4 established in this subsection shall only be used for debt service on agency
5 bond projects.
6 (c) Any fee established as provided by this subsection shall cease to be assessed
7 upon the retirement of the project bonds for which it services debt.
