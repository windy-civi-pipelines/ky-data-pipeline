19 SECTION 5. A NEW SECTION OF KRS CHAPTER 121 IS CREATED TO
20 READ AS FOLLOWS:
21 (1) The registry may bring a civil action to enforce Sections 2 and 3 of this Act and a

24 heard before being found liable for a violation of Section 2 or 3 of this Act.
25 (2) In all actions brought under subsection (1) of this section, the registry bears the
26 burden of proof and the action shall proceed as follows:
27 (a) Prior to discovery, the court shall set a hearing to determine whether there
Page 10 of 15
BR044500.100 - 445 - XXXX 2/12/2025 3:10 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 445
1 is probable cause that a committee or person has violated Section 2 or 3 of
2 this Act;
3 (b) If, after the hearing in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the court
4 determines that no probable cause exists to believe that a violation of
5 Section 2 or 3 of this Act has occurred, the court shall enter an order of
6 dismissal with prejudice;
7 (c) If, after the hearing in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the court
8 determines that probable cause does exist to believe that a violation of
9 Section 2 or 3 of this Act has occurred, the court shall enter an order to that
10 effect and the case shall proceed to trial on an expedited basis. Subject to
11 Section 6 of this Act, the entity alleged to have violated Section 2 or 3 of this
12 Act may, prior to the scheduling of trial, present evidence sufficient to rebut
13 the finding of probable cause by making an ex parte presentation of records
14 to the court for in camera review; and
15 (d) The losing party under paragraph (c) of this subsection has the right to:
16 1. An interlocutory expedited appeal; and
17 2. A stay of proceedings in the trial court.
18 (3) Within thirty (30) days of a finding that a committee has violated Section 2 or 3 of
19 this Act, the committee shall refund the contribution to the original contributor.
20 In the event of an appeal, the contribution shall be placed in escrow, after which
21 the funds shall be disbursed in accordance with the final order. If the committee
22 is unable to return the funds, the directors, officers, or executive members of the
23 committee shall be liable in their personal capacity, jointly and severally, for the
24 refund of said funds.
25 (4) Within thirty (30) days of a finding that any person or committee required to
26 report independent expenditures has violated Section 2 or 3 of this Act, the entity
27 making the independent expenditure shall disgorge funds in an amount equal to
Page 11 of 15
BR044500.100 - 445 - XXXX 2/12/2025 3:10 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 445
1 the reported cost of the independent expenditure to the registry. If the entity is
2 unable to disgorge the requisite funds, the directors, officers, or executive
3 members of the entity shall be liable in their personal capacities, jointly and
4 severally, for the payment of the amount due. In the event of an appeal, the funds
5 subject to disgorgement shall be placed in escrow, after which they shall be
6 disbursed in accordance with the final order.
7 (5) If any lobbyist, as defined in KRS 11A.010, violates Section 2 or 3 of this Act, the
8 lobbyist's registration may be revoked or suspended and the lobbyist may be
9 enjoined from receiving compensation or making expenditures for lobbying.
10 (6) If the registry prevails in an action brought under this section, the court may
11 award:
12 (a) Injunctive relief sufficient to prevent the defendant from violating or
13 engaging in acts that aid or abet violations of Sections 2 and 3 of this Act;
14 and
15 (b) Statutory damages up to two (2) times the amount of the prohibited
16 contribution or expenditure.
17 (7) In addition to the penalties in subsection (6) of this section, and any other
18 remedies provided by law, if the court finds a knowing or willful violation of

22 READ AS FOLLOWS:
23 (1) A lawful donor to a tax-exempt organization possesses a right of privacy in his or
24 her donations. Any investigation of an alleged violation of Section 2 or 3 of this

26 shield the identity of lawful donors as far as possible. No state or local
27 governmental entity, court, or officer of the court shall collect or require the

1 submission of information on the identity of any donor to a tax-exempt
2 organization other than those directly related to an alleged violation of Section 2
3 or 3 of this Act.
4 (2) No state or local governmental entity, court, or officer of the court shall disclose
5 to the public, or to another government official not directly involved in the
6 investigation, information revealing the identity of any donor to a tax-exempt
7 organization, unless the information is regarding the identity of a donor that
8 engaged in conduct prohibited by Section 2 or 3 of this Act after a final
9 determination has been made that the donor violated Section 2 or 3 of this Act.
10 (3) Any state or local governmental entity, court, or officer of the court who
11 knowingly or willfully violates subsection (2) of this section shall be guilty of a
12 Class A misdemeanor.
13 Section 7. KRS 121.190 is amended to read as follows:
14 (1) All newspaper or magazine advertising, posters, circulars, billboards, handbills,
15 sample ballots, and paid-for television or radio announcements which expressly
16 advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate, slate of candidates,
17 or group of candidates for nomination or election to any public office, or expressly
18 advocate or oppose a ballot measure, shall be identified by the words "paid for by"
19 followed by the name and address of the individual or committee which paid for the
20 communication; except that if paid for by a candidate, slate of candidates, or
21 campaign committee, it shall be identified only by the words "paid for by" followed
22 by the name of the candidate, slate of candidates, or campaign committee,
23 whichever is applicable. For television and radio broadcasts, compliance with
24 Federal Communications Commission regulations regarding sponsored programs
25 and broadcasts by candidates for public office shall be considered compliance with
26 this section.
27 (2) The disclaimer described in subsection (1) of this section shall appear and be

1 presented in a clear and conspicuous manner to give the reader or observer adequate
2 notice of the identity of the purchaser of the communication. A disclaimer does not
3 comply with this section if the disclaimer is difficult to read or if the placement of
4 the disclaimer is easily overlooked.
5 (3) The provisions of subsection (1) of this section shall not apply to:
6 (a) Any news articles, editorial endorsements, opinion, or commentary writings,
7 or letter to the editor printed in a newspaper, magazine, flyer, pamphlet, or
8 other periodical not owned or controlled by a candidate or committee;
9 (b) Any editorial endorsements or opinions aired by a broadcast facility not
10 owned or controlled by a candidate or committee;
11 (c) Any communication by a person made in the regular course and scope of the
12 person's business or any communication made by a membership organization
13 solely to members of the organization and the members' families; and
14 (d) Any communication that refers to any candidate only as part of the popular
15 name of a bill or statute.
16 (4) (a) A person shall not use, cause or permit to be used, or continue to use any
17 published, distributed, or broadcast political advertising containing express
18 advocacy that the person knows does not include the disclosure required by
19 subsection (1) of this section. A person is presumed to know that the use of
20 political advertising is prohibited by this subsection if the registry notifies the
21 person in writing that the use is prohibited.
22 (b) A person who learns that political advertising signs that have been distributed
23 do not include the disclosure required by subsection (1) of this section or
24 include a disclosure that does not comply with subsection (1) of this section
25 does not commit a violation of this subsection if the person makes a good-
26 faith attempt to remove or correct those signs within forty-eight (48) hours
27 and provides the registry with proof of correction.
