8 carried forward from the last report but need not specify receipts or
9 expenditures in further detail.
10 ïƒ¢Section 9. KRS 121.190 is amended to read as follows:
11 (1) All newspaper or magazine advertising, posters, circulars, billboards, handbills,

13 general public political advertising, which expressly advocate the election or
14 defeat of a clearly identified candidate, slate of candidates, or group of candidates
15 for nomination or election to any public office, or expressly advocate or oppose a
16 ballot measure, shall be identified by the words "paid for by" followed by the name
17 and address of the individual or committee which paid for the communication;
18 except that if paid for by a candidate, slate of candidates, or campaign committee, it
19 shall be identified only by the words "paid for by" followed by the name of the
20 candidate, slate of candidates, or campaign committee, whichever is applicable. For
21 television and radio broadcasts, compliance with Federal Communications
22 Commission regulations regarding sponsored programs and broadcasts by
23 candidates for public office shall be considered compliance with this section.
24 (2) The disclaimer described in subsection (1) of this section shall appear and be
25 presented in a clear and conspicuous manner to give the reader or observer adequate
26 notice of the identity of the purchaser of the communication. A disclaimer does not
27 comply with this section if the disclaimer is difficult to read or if the placement of
Page 32 of 34
HB004520.100 - 445 - XXXX 3/14/2025 8:16 PM Engrossed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS HB 45/EN
1 the disclaimer is easily overlooked.
2 (3) The provisions of subsection (1) of this section shall not apply to:
3 (a) Any news articles, editorial endorsements, opinion, or commentary writings,
4 or letter to the editor printed in a newspaper, magazine, flyer, pamphlet, or
5 other periodical not owned or controlled by a candidate or committee;
6 (b) Any editorial endorsements or opinions aired by a broadcast facility not
7 owned or controlled by a candidate or committee;
8 (c) Any communication by a person made in the regular course and scope of the
9 person's business or any communication made by a membership organization
10 solely to members of the organization and the members' families; and
11 (d) Any communication that refers to any candidate only as part of the popular
12 name of a bill or statute.
13 (4) (a) A person shall not use, cause or permit to be used, or continue to use any
14 published, distributed, or broadcast political advertising containing express
15 advocacy that the person knows does not include the disclosure required by
16 subsection (1) of this section. A person is presumed to know that the use of
17 political advertising is prohibited by this subsection if the registry notifies the
18 person in writing that the use is prohibited.
19 (b) A person who learns that political advertising signs that have been distributed
20 do not include the disclosure required by subsection (1) of this section or
21 include a disclosure that does not comply with subsection (1) of this section
22 does not commit a violation of this subsection if the person makes a good-
23 faith attempt to remove or correct those signs within forty-eight (48) hours
24 and provides the registry with proof of correction.
25 (5) The management of newspapers and magazines shall keep a one (1) year record of
26 all statements, articles, or advertisements referred to in subsection (1) of this
27 section, that appear in their publications, however, nothing in subsection (1) of this

2 magazines to identify themselves in the manner therein required with any article or
3 editorial written by them as part of their duties as an employee or employer.

14 defeat of a clearly identified candidate, slate of candidates, or group of candidates
15 for nomination or election to any public office, or expressly advocate or oppose a
16 ballot measure, shall be identified by the words "paid for by" followed by the name
17 and address of the individual or committee which paid for the communication;

20 candidate, slate of candidates, or campaign committee, whichever is applicable. For
21 television and radio broadcasts, compliance with Federal Communications
22 Commission regulations regarding sponsored programs and broadcasts by
23 candidates for public office shall be considered compliance with this section.
24 (2) The disclaimer described in subsection (1) of this section shall appear and be
25 presented in a clear and conspicuous manner to give the reader or observer adequate
26 notice of the identity of the purchaser of the communication. A disclaimer does not

19 (b) A person who learns that political advertising signs that have been distributed
20 do not include the disclosure required by subsection (1) of this section or
21 include a disclosure that does not comply with subsection (1) of this section
