(12) The date that an electronic or on-line report shall be deemed to have been filed with the registry shall be the
date on which it is received by the registry.
(13) All electronic or online filers shall affirm, under penalty of perjury, that the report filed with the registry is
complete and accurate.
(14) Filers who submit electronic campaign finance reports which are not readable, or cannot be copied shall be
deemed to not be in compliance with the requirements set forth in this section.

thereafter, reports required to be submitted to the registry involving candidates, slates of candidates,
committees, contributing organizations, and independent expenditures shall be reported electronically.

advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate, slate of candidates, or group of candidates for
nomination or election to any public office, or expressly advocate or oppose a ballot measure, shall be
identified by the words "paid for by" followed by the name and address of the individual or committee which

it shall be identified only by the words "paid for by" followed by the name of the candidate, slate of

use is prohibited.
(b) A person who learns that political advertising signs that have been distributed do not include the
disclosure required by subsection (1) of this section or include a disclosure that does not comply with
subsection (1) of this section does not commit a violation of this subsection if the person makes a good-
faith attempt to remove or correct those signs within forty-eight (48) hours and provides the registry
with proof of correction.
(5) The management of newspapers and magazines shall keep a one (1) year record of all statements, articles, or
advertisements referred to in subsection (1) of this section, that appear in their publications, however, nothing

(c) Any funds or contributions solicited or received by or on behalf of a candidate, slate of candidates, or

person or to support or oppose the same public issue, shall be deemed to have been solicited or received
for the current candidacy or for the election on the public issue if the funds or contributions are solicited

public issue is on the ballot.

(11) If adequate and appropriate agency funds are available to implement this subsection, electronic reporting shall
be made available by the registry to all candidates, slates of candidates, committees, contributing

submitted to the registry shall be the official campaign finance report for audit and other legal purposes,
whether mandated or filed by choice.
(12) The date that an electronic or on-line report shall be deemed to have been filed with the registry shall be the
date on which it is received by the registry.
(13) All electronic or online filers shall affirm, under penalty of perjury, that the report filed with the registry is
complete and accurate.
(14) Filers who submit electronic campaign finance reports which are not readable, or cannot be copied shall be
deemed to not be in compliance with the requirements set forth in this section.
(15) Beginning with the primary scheduled in calendar year 2020, and for each subsequent election scheduled
thereafter, reports required to be submitted to the registry involving candidates, slates of candidates,
committees, contributing organizations, and independent expenditures shall be reported electronically.
(16) (a) On each form that the registry supplies for the reports required under subsections (2), (3), and (6) of this
section, the registry shall include an entry reading, "No change since last report."
(b) If a person or entity that is required to report under subsection (2), (3), or (6) of this section has received
no money, loans, or other things of value from any source since the date of its last report and has not
authorized, incurred, or made any expenditures since that date, the person or entity may check or
otherwise designate the entry that reads, "No change since last report." A person or entity designating

television or radio announcements, or any other type of general public political advertising, which expressly
advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate, slate of candidates, or group of candidates for
nomination or election to any public office, or expressly advocate or oppose a ballot measure, shall be
identified by the words "paid for by" followed by the name and address of the individual or committee which
paid for the communication; except that if paid for by a candidate, slate of candidates, or campaign committee,
it shall be identified only by the words "paid for by" followed by the name of the candidate, slate of
candidates, or campaign committee, whichever is applicable. For television and radio broadcasts, compliance
with Federal Communications Commission regulations regarding sponsored programs and broadcasts by
candidates for public office shall be considered compliance with this section.
(2) The disclaimer described in subsection (1) of this section shall appear and be presented in a clear and
conspicuous manner to give the reader or observer adequate notice of the identity of the purchaser of the
communication. A disclaimer does not comply with this section if the disclaimer is difficult to read or if the
placement of the disclaimer is easily overlooked.
(3) The provisions of subsection (1) of this section shall not apply to:
(a) Any news articles, editorial endorsements, opinion, or commentary writings, or letter to the editor
printed in a newspaper, magazine, flyer, pamphlet, or other periodical not owned or controlled by a

(4) (a) A person shall not use, cause or permit to be used, or continue to use any published, distributed, or
broadcast political advertising containing express advocacy that the person knows does not include the
disclosure required by subsection (1) of this section. A person is presumed to know that the use of
political advertising is prohibited by this subsection if the registry notifies the person in writing that the
use is prohibited.
(b) A person who learns that political advertising signs that have been distributed do not include the
disclosure required by subsection (1) of this section or include a disclosure that does not comply with
subsection (1) of this section does not commit a violation of this subsection if the person makes a good-
faith attempt to remove or correct those signs within forty-eight (48) hours and provides the registry
with proof of correction.
(5) The management of newspapers and magazines shall keep a one (1) year record of all statements, articles, or
advertisements referred to in subsection (1) of this section, that appear in their publications, however, nothing
in subsection (1) of this section shall be construed to require editors or editorial writers of newspapers and
