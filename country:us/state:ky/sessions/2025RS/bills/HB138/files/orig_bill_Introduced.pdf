1 AN ACT relating to earned paid sick leave.
2 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
3 SECTION 1. A NEW SECTION OF KRS CHAPTER 337 IS CREATED TO
4 READ AS FOLLOWS:
5 (1) As used in this section:
6 (a) "Child" means a biological, adopted, or foster child, stepchild, or legal
7 ward of an employee if the child is less than eighteen (18) years old, or is
8 over eighteen (18) years old but incapable of self-care due to a mental or
9 physical disability;
10 (b) "Earned paid sick leave" means the time off from work that is provided by
11 an employer to an employee as computed under this section that can be used
12 for purposes set forth in this section and is compensated at the same hourly
13 rate as the employee earns from his or her employment at the time the
14 employee uses the paid sick leave; however, the hourly rate shall not be less
15 than the minimum hourly wage under KRS 337.275;
16 (c) "Employee" has the same meaning as in KRS 337.010(1)(e);
17 (d) "Employer" has the same meaning as in KRS 337.010(1)(d);
18 (e) "Health care provider" means any person licensed under federal or state
19 law to provide health care services, or any other person authorized to
20 provide health care by a licensed health care professional, including but not
21 limited to physicians, osteopaths, nurses, advanced practice registered
22 nurses, physician assistants, and psychologists;
23 (f) "Parent" means a biological, adoptive, or foster parent of an employee or
24 an employee's spouse, or other person who assumed the responsibilities of
25 parenthood when the employee or the employee's spouse was a child; and

27 (2) Each employer shall provide earned paid sick leave to each employee working for

1 the employer in the state. An employee shall begin accruing earned paid sick
2 leave beginning on his or her date of hire or on the effective date of this Act,
3 whichever is later, but employees shall not be entitled to use accrued earned sick
4 leave until the ninetieth calendar day following commencement of employment.
5 For every thirty (30) hours worked, the employee shall accrue one (1) hour of
6 earned paid sick leave. An employee exempt from overtime requirements under
7 state or federal law shall be assumed to work forty (40) hours each week unless
8 his or her normal work week is less than forty (40) hours, in which case earned
9 paid sick leave shall accrue based on that normal work week.
10 (3) The employer shall not be required to permit the employee to accrue at any one
11 (1) time, or carry forward from one (1) year to the next, more than forty (40)
12 hours of earned paid sick leave if the employer has less than ten (10) employees
13 or more than seventy-two (72) hours of earned paid sick leave if the employer has
14 ten (10) or more employees.
15 (4) An employer is considered to be in compliance with this section if the employer
16 offers any other fully paid leave that may be used for the purposes set forth in this
17 section in the manner provided for in this section and is accrued at a rate equal to
18 or greater than the rate described in this section. Nothing in this section shall be
19 construed to discourage or prohibit any employer from allowing the accrual of
20 earned paid sick leave at a faster rate, or the use of earned paid sick leave at an
21 earlier date, than this section requires.
22 (5) An employer shall permit an employee to use accrued earned paid sick leave
23 pursuant to this section for any of the following:
24 (a) Time needed for the diagnosis, care, or medical treatment of, or recovery
25 from, an employee's mental or physical illness, injury, or other health
26 condition;
27 (b) Time needed for the diagnosis, care, or medical treatment of, or recovery

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1077
1 from, a mental or physical illness, injury, or other health condition of the
2 employee's child, parent, or spouse; and
3 (c) Time needed due to circumstances resulting from the employee or the
4 employee's child, parent, or spouse being a victim of domestic violence, so
5 long as the leave is to allow the victim to:
6 1. Obtain medical attention needed to recover from physical or mental
7 injury or disability caused by the domestic violence;
8 2. Obtain services from a victim services organization;
9 3. Relocate due to domestic violence or sexual assault;
10 4. Obtain a restraining or protective order; or
11 5. Participate in any civil or criminal proceedings related to the domestic
12 violence.
13 (6) If the employee's need to use earned paid sick leave is foreseeable, the employer
14 may require advance notice, not to exceed seven (7) days prior to the date such
15 leave is to begin, of the intention to use earned paid sick leave and the expected
16 duration of the leave. The employee shall make a reasonable effort to schedule
17 the use of earned paid sick leave in a manner that does not unduly disrupt the
18 operations of the employer.
19 (7) If the employee's need to use earned paid sick leave is not foreseeable, an
20 employer may require an employee to give notice of the intention to use earned
21 paid sick leave as soon as practicable. For earned paid sick leave of more than
22 three (3) days, an employer may require reasonable documentation that the leave
23 is being used for a purpose permitted under this section. If the leave is used
24 pursuant to subsection (5)(a) or (b) of this section, documentation signed by a
25 health care provider who is treating the employee or the employee's child, parent,
26 or spouse indicating the need for the leave and the anticipated necessary number
27 of days of leave shall be considered reasonable documentation. If the leave is

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1077
1 used pursuant to subsection (5)(c) of this section, a court record, a law
2 enforcement report, or documentation signed by an attorney, police officer,
3 counselor, or representative of a victim services organization shall be considered
4 reasonable documentation.
5 (8) Unless an employee policy or collective bargaining agreement provides for the
6 payment of unused accrued earned paid sick leave benefits upon termination, an
7 employee shall not be entitled to payment of unused accrued earned paid sick
8 leave benefits upon termination of employment.
9 (9) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to require any employer to provide earned
10 paid sick leave for an employee's leave for any purpose other than those
11 described in this section.
12 (10) An employer shall not:
13 (a) Retaliate against an employee because the employee requests or uses earned
14 paid sick leave in accordance with this section or the employer's own earned
15 paid sick leave policy, or files a complaint alleging the employer's violation
16 of this section; or
17 (b) Count earned paid sick leave as an absence that may result in disciplinary
18 action against the employee.
19 (11) Each employer subject to this section shall, at the time of hiring, provide notice to
20 each employee of the entitlement to earned paid sick leave, the amount of earned
21 paid sick leave provided, and the terms under which earned paid sick leave may
22 be used.
23 (12) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit an employer from:
24 (a) Taking disciplinary action against an employee who used earned paid sick
25 leave for purposes other than those described in this section; or
26 (b) Adopting a policy whereby an employee may donate unused accrued earned
27 paid sick leave to another employee.

1 (13) (a) An employee shall not be required to use earned paid sick leave for any
2 absence during a period of time in which, by mutual consent of the
3 employee and the employer, the employee works an equivalent number of
4 additional hours during the same or the next pay period as the hours not
5 worked due to reasons permitted in this section.
6 (b) An employer shall not require an employee to work additional hours to
7 make up hours in which the employee was absent or require the employee to
8 find a replacement employee to cover hours during which the employee is
9 using earned paid sick leave.
