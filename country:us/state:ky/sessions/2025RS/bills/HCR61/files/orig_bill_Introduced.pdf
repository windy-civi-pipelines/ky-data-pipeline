3 WHEREAS, there is no highway numbered as United States Highway 111; and

9 and economic activity along the route, without incurring additional cost for road

13 NOW, THEREFORE,
14 Be it resolved by the House of Representatives of the General Assembly of the
15 Commonwealth of Kentucky, the Senate concurring therein:
16 Section 1. The General Assembly hereby urges the Kentucky Transportation
17 Cabinet to petition the American Association of State Highway and Transportation
18 Officials to designate as United States Highway 111 along the following routes:
19 (1) Kentucky Route 461 from United States Highway 25 at Mount Vernon to the
20 KY 80 interchange at Shopville;
21 (2) Kentucky Route 80 from the Kentucky Route 461 intersection to the
22 Kentucky Route 914 intersection;

24 intersection to the Kentucky Route 1247 intersection;

1 interchange through Monticello to the United States Highway 127 intersection;
2 (6) United States Highway 127 from the Kentucky Route 90 intersection through
3 Albany to the Tennessee Route 111 intersection at Static;
4 (7) Tennessee Route 111 for its entire length, to United States Highway 27 at
5 Soddy-Daisy;
6 (8) United States Highway 27 from the Tennessee Route 111 intersection to the
7 Tennessee Route 153 intersection; and
8 (9) Tennessee Route 153 from the United States Highway 27 intersection to the
9 United States Highway 11/64 intersection just before Interstate 75.
10 Section 2. The proposed petition includes United States Highway 27 and
11 Tennessee Route 153 in order to follow AASHTO's general principle that three-digit
12 federal routes should be spur routes of a two-digit federal route, with its number
13 incorporated as the last two digits of the spur route. If AASHTO does not deem this
14 necessary, and Tennessee does not wish to extend United States Highway 111 to United
15 States Highway 11, the last two segments in subsections (8) and (9) of Section 1 of this
16 Resolution may be considered optional.
17 Section 3. Except in the case of Kentucky Route 461, this proposal does not call
18 for elimination of existing route numbers. United States Highway 111 could be co-signed
19 with the segments of Kentucky Routes 80, 914, 1247, and 90, and United States Highway
20 127, depending on the decisions of state officials in consultation with local officials.
