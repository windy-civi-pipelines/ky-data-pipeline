11 compact.
12 H. If adverse action is taken by the home state against a licensee’s home state
13 resulting in an encumbrance on the home state license, the licensee’s compact

17 licensee’s compact privileges are revoked in all member states during the
18 pendency of the order.

20 license, as certified by the home state’s licensing authority, the licensee must meet
21 the requirements of Section 4A. of this compact and follow the administrative
22 requirements to reapply to obtain a compact privilege in any remote state.

24 of the data system. The administrator of the data system shall promptly notify the

18 RULEMAKING
19 A. The compact commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively
20 and efficiently implement and administer the purposes and provisions of the
21 compact. A rule shall be invalid and have no force or effect only if a court of

6 2. Except as otherwise provided in this compact, venue is proper and judicial
7 proceedings by or against the compact commission shall be brought solely
8 and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal
9 office of the compact commission is located. The compact commission may
10 waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to
11 participate in alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein
12 shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in any action against
13 a licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such similar
14 matter.
15 3. The compact commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in
16 any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the compact
17 and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes.
18 Failure to provide the compact commission service of process shall render a
19 judgment or order void as to the compact commission, this compact, or
20 promulgated rules.
21 B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination.
22 1. If the compact commission determines that a member state has defaulted in

1 technical assistance regarding the default.
2 2. The compact commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to the
3 other member states.

5 terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the

8 termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of
9 obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.
10 D. Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other
11 means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend
12 or terminate shall be given by the compact commission to the Governor, the

14 state’s licensing authority, and each of the member states’ licensing authority.

22 notice of termination.

13 District of Columbia or the federal district where the compact commission
14 has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the
15 compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both
16 injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is
17 necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation,

7 enacted into law in the seventh member state.
8 1. On or after the effective date of the compact, the compact commission shall

10 states ("charter member states") to determine if the statute enacted by each
11 such charter member state is materially different than the model compact
12 statute.
13 a. A charter member state whose enactment is found to be materially
14 different from the model compact statute shall be entitled to the
15 default process set forth in Section 11 of this compact.
16 b. If any member state is later found to be in default, or is terminated, or

21 charter member states shall be subject to the process set forth in Section

1 existence shall be considered to be actions of the compact commission
2 unless specifically repudiated by the compact commission.
3 4. Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the compact commission’s
4 initial adoption of the rules and bylaws shall be subject to the rules and
5 bylaws as they exist on the date on which the compact becomes law in that

16 withdrawal.
17 3. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this compact, a state

1 enacted into the laws of all member states.
2 SECTION 13.
3 CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
4 A. This compact and the compact commission’s rulemaking authority shall be
5 liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the implementation and
6 administration of the compact. Provisions of the compact expressly authorizing or
7 requiring the promulgation of rules shall not be construed to limit the compact
8 commission’s rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
9 B. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause,
10 sentence, or provision of this compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction
11 to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, a state seeking
12 participation in the compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof
13 to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional
14 by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact
15 and the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person, or
16 circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
17 C. Notwithstanding Section 13.B. of this compact, the compact commission may
18 deny a state’s participation in the compact or, in accordance with the
19 requirements of Section 11.B. of this compact, terminate a member state’s
20 participation in the compact, if it determines that a constitutional requirement of
21 a member state is a material departure from the compact. Otherwise, if this
22 compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, the
23 compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states
24 and in full force and effect as to the member state affected as to all severable
25 matters.
