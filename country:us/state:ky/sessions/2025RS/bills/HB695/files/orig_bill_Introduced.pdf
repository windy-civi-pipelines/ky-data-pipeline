15 facilities services, or funds may be evaluated and counted toward the fifteen percent
16 (15%) local funding requirements.

19 the Social Security Act;
20 (b) The Medical Assistance Plan under Titles XVIII and XIX of the Social
21 Security Act;
22 (c) The State Plan on Aging under the Older Americans Act; or

1 (5) Providers contracting with the cabinet to provide essential services shall be
2 responsible for the collection of fees and contributions for services in accordance
3 with administrative regulations promulgated by the cabinet. Providers are
4 authorized to assess and collect fees for services rendered in accordance with those
5 administrative regulations. To help pay for essential services received, a
6 functionally impaired elderly person shall pay an amount of money based on an
7 overall ability to pay in accordance with a schedule of fees established by the
8 cabinet. Fees shall reflect the degree to which the cabinet or contracting entity uses
9 volunteers in the provision of services. Where essential services are provided by
10 volunteers, fees shall only be assessed in an amount that will cover the cost of
11 materials and other goods used in the provision of services. The cost of materials
12 and other goods used by volunteers shall be reasonably similar to the cost of goods
13 when paid personnel are used. Fees shall not be required of any person who is
14 "needy aged" as defined in KRS 205.010; however, voluntary contributions may be
15 encouraged. This subsection shall not apply to programs utilizing federal funds
16 when administrative regulations require contributions to revert to the original

20 (2) The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky recognizes and declares

22 provide medical care to its indigent citizenry; and it is the purpose of KRS 205.510
23 to 205.630 to provide such care.
24 (3) Further, it is the policy of the Commonwealth to take advantage of all federal funds
25 that may be available for medical assistance. To qualify for federal funds the
26 secretary for health and family services may, except as provided in Section 1 of
27 this Act, by regulation comply with any requirement that may be imposed or

4 XIX of the Social Security Act which require that the Kentucky Medical Assistance

7 (5) The Kentucky Medical Assistance Program shall be the payor of last resort and its

19 engagement activities, utilize the same requirements established in 7 C.F.R.
20 sec. 273.24;
21 (b) Participation in the job placement assistance program established in KRS
22 151B.420 shall constitute qualifying community engagement activities; and
23 (c) The cabinet shall, on a monthly basis, provide the Education and Labor
24 Cabinet with the name and contact information of each individual
