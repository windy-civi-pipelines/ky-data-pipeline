program as permitted under 42 U.S.C. sec. 18051 or make any change to eligibility, coverage, or benefits in
the Medicaid program, including by pursuing or applying for a waiver of federal Medicaid law under Title
42 of the United States Code, seeking to amend or renew an existing waiver granted under Title 42 of the

a waiver under Title 42 of the United States Code, amend an existing waiver granted under Title 42 of the
United States Code, submit a state plan amendment, or make any other change to eligibility, coverage, or

impact of the change for which it is seeking authorization to the Legislative Research Commission for
referral to the Medicaid Oversight and Advisory Board, the Interim Joint Committee on Appropriations and
Revenue, the Interim Joint Committee on Families and Children, the Interim Joint Committee on Health
Services, and the Office of Budget Review. The fiscal impact assessment required by this subsection shall
include a review of any anticipated expenditures related to the change and any projected savings that may
be generated by the change for at least two (2) consecutive state fiscal years.
(3) If the cabinet seeks authorization from the General Assembly to renew an existing waiver granted under
Title 42 of the United States Code, the cabinet shall be required to submit a fiscal impact assessment as

waiver. The assessments required by this subsection shall be submitted to the Legislative Research

Committee on Families and Children, the Interim Joint Committee on Health Services, and the Office of
Budget Review at least twelve (12) calendar months prior to the date on which the existing waiver is set to

(4) (a) This section shall not be interpreted as limiting the General Assembly's ability to direct the cabinet to
make changes to the Medicaid program, including but not limited to changes to existing waivers,
eligibility, coverage, or benefits.
(b) Any act of the General Assembly directing the Cabinet for Health and Family Services or the
Department for Medicaid Services to make a change to the Medicaid program shall constitute
authorization for that change as required by subsection (1) of this section.
(5) (a) This section shall not be interpreted as limiting the cabinet's ability to make changes to the Medicaid
program that it determines are necessary:
1. To comply with any requirements that may be imposed by federal law or by the federal Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services;
2. In response to a national emergency declaration issued by the President of the United States;
3. In response to a federal disaster declaration issued by the President of the United States; or

established in KRS 205.6483.
Section 2. KRS 205.460 is amended to read as follows:
(1) The cabinet shall fund, directly or through a contracting entity or entities, in each district, a program of
essential services which shall have as its primary purpose the prevention of unnecessary institutionalization of
functionally impaired elderly persons. The cabinet may use funds appropriated under this section to contract
with public and private agencies, long-term care facilities, local governments, and other providers to provide
core and essential services. The cabinet may provide core and essential services when such services cannot
otherwise be purchased.
(2) In providing essential services, all existing community resources available to functionally impaired elderly
persons shall be utilized. Additional services may be provided, but shall not be funded from funds appropriated
under this section. Volunteers may be used where practicable to provide essential services to functionally
impaired elderly persons. The cabinet or contracting entity shall provide or arrange for the provision of
training and supervision of volunteers to ensure the delivery of quality services. The cabinet or contracting
entity shall provide or arrange for appropriate insurance coverage to protect volunteers from personal liability
while acting within the scope of their volunteer duties. In providing essential services under this section, the
cabinet shall provide services to meet the needs of the minority elderly as identified by the cabinet pursuant to
KRS 205.201.
(3) Entities contracting with the cabinet to provide essential services under KRS 205.455 and this section shall
provide a minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the funding necessary for the support of program operations.
No local match is required for assessment and case management. Local contributions, whether materials,
commodities, transportation, office space, personal services, or other types of facilities services, or funds may
be evaluated and counted toward the fifteen percent (15%) local funding requirements.
(4) When possible, funding for core services may be obtained under:
(a) The Comprehensive Annual Social Services Program plan under Title XX of the Social Security Act;
(b) The Medical Assistance Plan under Titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act;
(c) The State Plan on Aging under the Older Americans Act; or
(d) Veteran's benefit programs under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. sec.[secs.] 1 et seq., as amended.
The cabinet may, except as provided in Section 1 of this Act, seek federal waivers if necessary to enable the
use of funds provided through Titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act for the provision of essential
services.
(5) Providers contracting with the cabinet to provide essential services shall be responsible for the collection of
fees and contributions for services in accordance with administrative regulations promulgated by the cabinet.
Providers are authorized to assess and collect fees for services rendered in accordance with those

CHAPTER 110 3
administrative regulations. To help pay for essential services received, a functionally impaired elderly person
shall pay an amount of money based on an overall ability to pay in accordance with a schedule of fees
established by the cabinet. Fees shall reflect the degree to which the cabinet or contracting entity uses
volunteers in the provision of services. Where essential services are provided by volunteers, fees shall only be
assessed in an amount that will cover the cost of materials and other goods used in the provision of services.
The cost of materials and other goods used by volunteers shall be reasonably similar to the cost of goods when
paid personnel are used. Fees shall not be required of any person who is "needy aged" as defined in KRS
205.010; however, voluntary contributions may be encouraged. This subsection shall not apply to programs
utilizing federal funds when administrative regulations require contributions to revert to the original funding
source.
Section 3. KRS 205.520 is amended to read as follows:
(1) KRS 205.510 to 205.630 shall be known as the "Medical Assistance Act."
(2) The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky recognizes and declares that it is an essential
function, duty, and responsibility of the state government to provide medical care to its indigent citizenry; and
it is the purpose of KRS 205.510 to 205.630 to provide such care.
(3) Further, it is the policy of the Commonwealth to take advantage of [all ]federal funds that may be available for
medical assistance. To qualify for federal funds the secretary for health and family services may, except as
provided in Section 1 of this Act, by regulation comply with any requirement that may be imposed or
opportunity that may be presented by federal law. Nothing in KRS 205.510 to 205.630 is intended to limit the
secretary's power in this respect.
(4) It is the intention of the General Assembly to comply with the provisions of Title XIX of the Social Security
Act which require that the Kentucky Medical Assistance Program recover from third parties which have a
legal liability to pay for care and services paid by the Kentucky Medical Assistance Program.
(5) The Kentucky Medical Assistance Program shall be the payor of last resort and its right to recover under KRS
205.622 to 205.630 shall be superior to any right of reimbursement, subrogation, or indemnity of any liable
third party.
Section 4. KRS 205.5371 is amended to read as follows:
(1) The cabinet, to the extent permitted under federal law, shall[ no later than April 15, 2023,] implement a
mandatory community engagement waiver program for able-bodied adults without dependents who have been

establish the mandatory community engagement waiver program for able-bodied adults without
dependents described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section within ninety (90) days after the
effective date of this Act.
(b) As required in Section 6 of this Act, the cabinet shall provide a copy and summary of the waiver
application submitted pursuant to this section to the Legislative Research Commission for referral to
the Medicaid Oversight and Advisory Board, the Interim Joint Committee on Appropriations and
Revenue, and the Interim Joint Committee on Health Services concurrent with submitting the
