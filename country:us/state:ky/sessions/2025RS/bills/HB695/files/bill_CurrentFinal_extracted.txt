3 Section 2. KRS 205.460 is amended to read as follows:
4 (1) The cabinet shall fund, directly or through a contracting entity or entities, in each
5 district, a program of essential services which shall have as its primary purpose the
6 prevention of unnecessary institutionalization of functionally impaired elderly
7 persons. The cabinet may use funds appropriated under this section to contract with
8 public and private agencies, long-term care facilities, local governments, and other
9 providers to provide core and essential services. The cabinet may provide core and
10 essential services when such services cannot otherwise be purchased.
11 (2) In providing essential services, all existing community resources available to
12 functionally impaired elderly persons shall be utilized. Additional services may be
13 provided, but shall not be funded from funds appropriated under this section.
14 Volunteers may be used where practicable to provide essential services to
15 functionally impaired elderly persons. The cabinet or contracting entity shall
16 provide or arrange for the provision of training and supervision of volunteers to
17 ensure the delivery of quality services. The cabinet or contracting entity shall
18 provide or arrange for appropriate insurance coverage to protect volunteers from
19 personal liability while acting within the scope of their volunteer duties. In
20 providing essential services under this section, the cabinet shall provide services to
21 meet the needs of the minority elderly as identified by the cabinet pursuant to KRS
22 205.201.
23 (3) Entities contracting with the cabinet to provide essential services under KRS
24 205.455 and this section shall provide a minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the
25 funding necessary for the support of program operations. No local match is required

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS HB 695/VO
1 facilities services, or funds may be evaluated and counted toward the fifteen percent
2 (15%) local funding requirements.
3 (4) When possible, funding for core services may be obtained under:
4 (a) The Comprehensive Annual Social Services Program plan under Title XX of
5 the Social Security Act;
6 (b) The Medical Assistance Plan under Titles XVIII and XIX of the Social
7 Security Act;
8 (c) The State Plan on Aging under the Older Americans Act; or
9 (d) Veteran's benefit programs under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. sec.[secs.] 1 et

13 the Social Security Act for the provision of essential services.
14 (5) Providers contracting with the cabinet to provide essential services shall be
15 responsible for the collection of fees and contributions for services in accordance
16 with administrative regulations promulgated by the cabinet. Providers are
17 authorized to assess and collect fees for services rendered in accordance with those
18 administrative regulations. To help pay for essential services received, a
19 functionally impaired elderly person shall pay an amount of money based on an
20 overall ability to pay in accordance with a schedule of fees established by the
21 cabinet. Fees shall reflect the degree to which the cabinet or contracting entity uses
22 volunteers in the provision of services. Where essential services are provided by
23 volunteers, fees shall only be assessed in an amount that will cover the cost of
24 materials and other goods used in the provision of services. The cost of materials
25 and other goods used by volunteers shall be reasonably similar to the cost of goods
26 when paid personnel are used. Fees shall not be required of any person who is
27 "needy aged" as defined in KRS 205.010; however, voluntary contributions may be

3 funding source.
4 Section 3. KRS 205.520 is amended to read as follows:
5 (1) KRS 205.510 to 205.630 shall be known as the "Medical Assistance Act."
6 (2) The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky recognizes and declares
7 that it is an essential function, duty, and responsibility of the state government to
8 provide medical care to its indigent citizenry; and it is the purpose of KRS 205.510
9 to 205.630 to provide such care.
10 (3) Further, it is the policy of the Commonwealth to take advantage of [all ]federal
11 funds that may be available for medical assistance. To qualify for federal funds the
12 secretary for health and family services may, except as provided in Section 1 of
13 this Act, by regulation comply with any requirement that may be imposed or
14 opportunity that may be presented by federal law. Nothing in KRS 205.510 to
15 205.630 is intended to limit the secretary's power in this respect.
16 (4) It is the intention of the General Assembly to comply with the provisions of Title
17 XIX of the Social Security Act which require that the Kentucky Medical Assistance
18 Program recover from third parties which have a legal liability to pay for care and
19 services paid by the Kentucky Medical Assistance Program.
20 (5) The Kentucky Medical Assistance Program shall be the payor of last resort and its
21 right to recover under KRS 205.622 to 205.630 shall be superior to any right of

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS HB 695/VO
1 AN ACT relating to the Medicaid program and declaring an emergency.
2 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
3 Section 1. KRS 205.5372 is amended to read as follows:
4 (1) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, including but not limited to
5 Sections 2 and 3 of this Act, the cabinet shall not, unless required by federal law,
6 exercise the state's option to develop a basic health program as permitted under 42
7 U.S.C. sec. 18051 or make any change to eligibility, coverage, or benefits in the
8 Medicaid program, including by pursuing or applying for a waiver of federal
9 Medicaid law under Title 42 of the United States Code, seeking to amend or
10 renew an existing waiver granted under Title 42 of the United States Code, or
11 pursuing a state plan amendment, without first obtaining specific authorization
12 from the General Assembly to do so.
13 (2) If the cabinet seeks authorization from the General Assembly to establish a basic
14 health program, apply for a waiver under Title 42 of the United States Code,
15 amend an existing waiver granted under Title 42 of the United States Code,
16 submit a state plan amendment, or make any other change to eligibility, coverage,
17 or benefits in the Medicaid program, the cabinet shall submit a detailed
18 assessment of the potential fiscal impact of the change for which it is seeking
19 authorization to the Legislative Research Commission for referral to the
20 Medicaid Oversight and Advisory Board, the Interim Joint Committee on
21 Appropriations and Revenue, the Interim Joint Committee on Families and
22 Children, the Interim Joint Committee on Health Services, and the Office of
23 Budget Review. The fiscal impact assessment required by this subsection shall
24 include a review of any anticipated expenditures related to the change and any
25 projected savings that may be generated by the change for at least two (2)
26 consecutive state fiscal years.
27 (3) If the cabinet seeks authorization from the General Assembly to renew an

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS HB 695/VO
1 existing waiver granted under Title 42 of the United States Code, the cabinet shall
2 be required to submit a fiscal impact assessment as described in subsection (2) of
3 this section and an assessment of the efficacy and necessity of the existing waiver.
4 The assessments required by this subsection shall be submitted to the Legislative
5 Research Commission for referral to the Interim Joint Committee on
6 Appropriations and Revenue, the Interim Joint Committee on Families and
7 Children, the Interim Joint Committee on Health Services, and the Office of
8 Budget Review at least twelve (12) calendar months prior to the date on which the
9 existing waiver is set to expire.
10 (4) (a) This section shall not be interpreted as limiting the General Assembly's
11 ability to direct the cabinet to make changes to the Medicaid program,
12 including but not limited to changes to existing waivers, eligibility,
13 coverage, or benefits.
14 (b) Any act of the General Assembly directing the Cabinet for Health and
15 Family Services or the Department for Medicaid Services to make a change
16 to the Medicaid program shall constitute authorization for that change as
17 required by subsection (1) of this section.
18 (5) (a) This section shall not be interpreted as limiting the cabinet's ability to make
19 changes to the Medicaid program that it determines are necessary:
20 1. To comply with any requirements that may be imposed by federal law
21 or by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services;
22 2. In response to a national emergency declaration issued by the
23 President of the United States;
24 3. In response to a federal disaster declaration issued by the President of

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS HB 695/VO
1 (b) If the cabinet determines that a change to the Medicaid program is
2 necessary to comply with requirements imposed by federal law, the cabinet
3 shall, at least ninety (90) days prior to implementing the necessary changes,
4 submit an assessment of the potential fiscal impact, as described in
5 subsection (2) of this section, of those changes to the Legislative Research
6 Commission for referral to the Medicaid Oversight and Advisory Board, the
7 Interim Joint Committee on Appropriations and Revenue, the Interim Joint
8 Committee on Families and Children, the Interim Joint Committee on
9 Health Services, and the Office of Budget Review.
10 (c) If the cabinet determines that a change to the Medicaid program is
11 necessary to respond to a national emergency declaration or federal disaster
12 declaration issued by the President of the United States or a state of
13 emergency declared by the Governor of the Commonwealth, any such
14 change shall be temporary in nature and shall only be in effect for the
15 duration of the emergency or disaster declaration.
16 (6) Subsection (1) of this section shall not apply to:
17 (a) Medicaid directed or supplemental payment programs initially approved by
18 the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services prior to the
19 effective date of this Act, including but not limited to:
20 1. Those payment programs established in KRS 205.5601 to 205.5603,
21 205.6405 to 205.6408, 205.6411, and 205.6412, and 907 KAR 10:015
22 and 907 KAR 10:830; and

1 Medical Assistance Program established in KRS 205.510 to 205.5630 and the
2 Kentucky Children's Health Insurance Program established in KRS 205.6483.
3 Section 2. KRS 205.460 is amended to read as follows:
4 (1) The cabinet shall fund, directly or through a contracting entity or entities, in each
5 district, a program of essential services which shall have as its primary purpose the
6 prevention of unnecessary institutionalization of functionally impaired elderly
7 persons. The cabinet may use funds appropriated under this section to contract with
8 public and private agencies, long-term care facilities, local governments, and other
9 providers to provide core and essential services. The cabinet may provide core and
10 essential services when such services cannot otherwise be purchased.
11 (2) In providing essential services, all existing community resources available to
12 functionally impaired elderly persons shall be utilized. Additional services may be
13 provided, but shall not be funded from funds appropriated under this section.
14 Volunteers may be used where practicable to provide essential services to
15 functionally impaired elderly persons. The cabinet or contracting entity shall
16 provide or arrange for the provision of training and supervision of volunteers to
17 ensure the delivery of quality services. The cabinet or contracting entity shall
18 provide or arrange for appropriate insurance coverage to protect volunteers from
19 personal liability while acting within the scope of their volunteer duties. In
20 providing essential services under this section, the cabinet shall provide services to
21 meet the needs of the minority elderly as identified by the cabinet pursuant to KRS
22 205.201.
23 (3) Entities contracting with the cabinet to provide essential services under KRS
24 205.455 and this section shall provide a minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the
25 funding necessary for the support of program operations. No local match is required
26 for assessment and case management. Local contributions, whether materials,
27 commodities, transportation, office space, personal services, or other types of
Page 4 of 27
HB069590.100 - 280 - XXXX 3/27/2025 5:04 PM Vetoed and Overridden

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS HB 695/VO
1 facilities services, or funds may be evaluated and counted toward the fifteen percent
2 (15%) local funding requirements.
3 (4) When possible, funding for core services may be obtained under:
4 (a) The Comprehensive Annual Social Services Program plan under Title XX of
5 the Social Security Act;
6 (b) The Medical Assistance Plan under Titles XVIII and XIX of the Social
7 Security Act;
8 (c) The State Plan on Aging under the Older Americans Act; or
9 (d) Veteran's benefit programs under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. sec.[secs.] 1 et
10 seq., as amended.
11 The cabinet may, except as provided in Section 1 of this Act, seek federal waivers
12 if necessary to enable the use of funds provided through Titles XVIII and XIX of
13 the Social Security Act for the provision of essential services.
14 (5) Providers contracting with the cabinet to provide essential services shall be
15 responsible for the collection of fees and contributions for services in accordance
16 with administrative regulations promulgated by the cabinet. Providers are
17 authorized to assess and collect fees for services rendered in accordance with those
18 administrative regulations. To help pay for essential services received, a
19 functionally impaired elderly person shall pay an amount of money based on an
20 overall ability to pay in accordance with a schedule of fees established by the
21 cabinet. Fees shall reflect the degree to which the cabinet or contracting entity uses
22 volunteers in the provision of services. Where essential services are provided by
23 volunteers, fees shall only be assessed in an amount that will cover the cost of
24 materials and other goods used in the provision of services. The cost of materials
25 and other goods used by volunteers shall be reasonably similar to the cost of goods
26 when paid personnel are used. Fees shall not be required of any person who is
27 "needy aged" as defined in KRS 205.010; however, voluntary contributions may be

1 encouraged. This subsection shall not apply to programs utilizing federal funds
2 when administrative regulations require contributions to revert to the original
3 funding source.
4 Section 3. KRS 205.520 is amended to read as follows:
5 (1) KRS 205.510 to 205.630 shall be known as the "Medical Assistance Act."
6 (2) The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky recognizes and declares
7 that it is an essential function, duty, and responsibility of the state government to
8 provide medical care to its indigent citizenry; and it is the purpose of KRS 205.510
9 to 205.630 to provide such care.
10 (3) Further, it is the policy of the Commonwealth to take advantage of [all ]federal
11 funds that may be available for medical assistance. To qualify for federal funds the
12 secretary for health and family services may, except as provided in Section 1 of
13 this Act, by regulation comply with any requirement that may be imposed or
14 opportunity that may be presented by federal law. Nothing in KRS 205.510 to
15 205.630 is intended to limit the secretary's power in this respect.
16 (4) It is the intention of the General Assembly to comply with the provisions of Title
17 XIX of the Social Security Act which require that the Kentucky Medical Assistance
18 Program recover from third parties which have a legal liability to pay for care and
19 services paid by the Kentucky Medical Assistance Program.
20 (5) The Kentucky Medical Assistance Program shall be the payor of last resort and its
21 right to recover under KRS 205.622 to 205.630 shall be superior to any right of
22 reimbursement, subrogation, or indemnity of any liable third party.
23 Section 4. KRS 205.5371 is amended to read as follows:
24 (1) The cabinet, to the extent permitted under federal law, shall[ no later than April 15,
25 2023,] implement a mandatory community engagement waiver program for able-
26 bodied adults without dependents who have been enrolled in the state's medical
27 assistance program for more than twelve (12) months.

1 (2) If the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services approves the
2 implementation of a mandatory community engagement waiver program pursuant
3 to subsection (1) of this section:

10 Cabinet with the name and contact information of each individual
11 participating in the community engagement program.
12 (3) (a) The cabinet is hereby authorized, as is required under Section 1 of this Act,

14 and Medicaid Services requesting approval to establish the mandatory
15 community engagement waiver program for able-bodied adults without
16 dependents described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section within ninety
17 (90) days after the effective date of this Act.
18 (b) As required in Section 6 of this Act, the cabinet shall provide a copy and
19 summary of the waiver application submitted pursuant to this section to the
20 Legislative Research Commission for referral to the Medicaid Oversight
21 and Advisory Board, the Interim Joint Committee on Appropriations and
22 Revenue, and the Interim Joint Committee on Health Services concurrent
23 with submitting the application to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
24 Services and shall provide an update on the status of the application at least
25 quarterly.
26 (4) As used in this section, "able-bodied adult without dependents" means an individual
