CHAPTER 96
( HJR 15 )
A JOINT RESOLUTION to return for permanent display on the New State Capitol grounds the granite Ten
Commandments monument given to the Commonwealth of Kentucky in 1971 by the Fraternal Order of Eagles.
WHEREAS, in 1971, the Kentucky State Aerie of the Fraternal Order of Eagles donated to the Commonwealth
of Kentucky a granite monument inscribed with the Ten Commandments; and
WHEREAS, it remained on permanent display on the New State Capitol grounds until the 1980s, when it was
moved to storage due to a construction project; and
WHEREAS, the monument remained in storage until 2000, when a joint legislative resolution was signed into
law that required it be returned to the New State Capitol grounds for permanent display near the floral clock; and
WHEREAS, in 2002, applying the test established by the United States Supreme Court in Lemon v. Kurtzman,
403 U.S. 602 (1971), and its progeny, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Adland v. Russ, 307
F.3d 471 (6th Cir. 2002), affirmed a District Court order prohibiting the enforcement of the 2000 joint legislative
resolution; and
WHEREAS, the monument was thereafter returned to the Fraternal Order of Eagles and given to the care of
the organization’s Hopkinsville, Kentucky, chapter, which has kept it to the present time; and
WHEREAS, in 2005, the United States Supreme Court in Van Orden v. Perry, 545 U.S. 677 (2005), upheld
the exhibition of an essentially identical Fraternal Order of Eagles’ Ten Commandments monument on permanent
display on the state Capitol grounds in Austin, Texas. The Court held that Lemon was "not useful in dealing with the
sort of passive monument that Texas has erected on its Capitol grounds," and instead focused on the "nature of the
monument" and "our Nation’s history." Id. at 686; and
WHEREAS, in 2014, the United States Supreme Court in Town of Greece v. Galloway, 572 U.S. 565, 575
(2014), upheld a town council’s practice of beginning its public meetings with an invocation. The Court's majority
opinion did not even mention Lemon and instead held "the Establishment Clause must be interpreted by reference to
historical practices and understandings." Id. at 576; and
WHEREAS, in 2019, the United States Supreme Court in The American Legion v. American Humanist
Association, 588 U.S. 29 (2019), upheld the display of a 32-foot tall Latin cross on state property erected as a World
War I memorial. The Court expressly rejected Lemon and established a "presumption of constitutionality for
longstanding monuments, symbols, and practices" that "use, for ceremonial, celebratory, or commemorative
purposes, … words or symbols with religious associations." Id. at 51, 52, and 57; and
WHEREAS, in 2022, the United States Supreme Court in Kennedy v. Bremerton School District, 597 U.S. 507
(2022), upheld the right of a high school football coach to pray privately on the playing field after games. Citing
American Legion and Town of Greece, the Court held that the "shortcomings" of Lemon had become "so apparent
that this Court long ago abandoned Lemon and its endorsement test offshoot." Id. at 534. Formally replacing Lemon,
the Court held "the Establishment Clause must be interpreted by reference to historical practices and understandings,"
and that the "line that courts and governments must draw between the permissible and the impermissible has to
accord with history and faithfully reflect the understanding of the Founding Fathers." Id. at 535-36; and
WHEREAS, the legal precedent under which the 2000 joint legislative resolution’s mandate to return the
monument to the New State Capitol grounds near the floral clock was enjoined, has been abandoned by the United
States Supreme Court, and is no longer good law; and
WHEREAS, the Ten Commandments monument is "one of over a hundred largely identical monoliths . . .
distributed [by the Fraternal Order of Eagles] to state and local governments throughout the Nation over the course of
several decades," Van Orden, 545 U.S. at 713; and
WHEREAS, "[s]uch acknowledgments of the role played by the Ten Commandments in our Nation's heritage
are common throughout America" and "throughout . . . our Nation’s Capital," Van Orden, 545 U.S. at 688-89; and
WHEREAS, the United States Supreme Court’s "opinions, like [its] building, have recognized the role the
Decalogue plays in America's heritage," Van Orden, 545 U.S. at 689; and
Legislative Research Commission PDF Version

2 ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY
WHEREAS, "Executive and Legislative Branches have also acknowledged the historical role of the Ten
Commandments," which "have an undeniable historical meaning," Van Orden, 545 U.S. at 690; and
WHEREAS, "the Ten Commandments have had a significant impact on the development of the fundamental
legal principles of Western Civilization," House Concurrent Resolution 31, 105th Congress (1997); and
WHEREAS, the Ten Commandments "have historical significance as one of the foundations of our legal
system," American Legion, 588 U.S. at 53; and
WHEREAS, "for largely that reason, they are depicted in the marble frieze in [the United States Supreme
Court’s] courtroom and in other prominent public buildings in our Nation's capital," American Legion, 588 U.S. at
53; and
WHEREAS, the Ten Commandments have undeniable historical significance in the history and heritage of the
Commonwealth of Kentucky and the nation; and
WHEREAS, it is the historical practice and understanding of the Commonwealth and the nation to
acknowledge our history and heritage with permanent depictions and displays on government buildings and grounds,
including the state Capitol and its grounds, and including displays of the Ten Commandments; and
WHEREAS, the Fraternal Order of Eagles has expressed its willingness to return the monument to the
Commonwealth for permanent display on the New State Capitol grounds;
