produced endogenously in a healthy person of the same age and sex; and

(2) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, public funds shall not be directly or indirectly used,
granted, paid, or distributed for the purpose of providing a cosmetic service or elective procedure to an
inmate in a correctional facility.
(3) If a health care provider has initiated a course of treatment for an inmate that includes the prescription or
administration of any drug or medication for a cosmetic service or elective procedure and the health care
provider determines and documents in the inmate’s medical record that immediately terminating use of the
drug or medication would cause physical harm to the inmate, the health care provider may institute a
period during which the inmate’s use of the drug or hormone is systematically reduced and eliminated.
