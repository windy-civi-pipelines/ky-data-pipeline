UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1452
2 2025, at McNeely Lake.
3 WHEREAS, Brandon Malone, a senior at DeSales High School in Louisville,
4 Kentucky, bravely saved the lives of two young girls after they fell through ice into a
5 frozen lake; and
6 WHEREAS, Brandon Malone sprang into action when he heard the girls crying for
7 help only a few yards away, decisively jumping in to help strangers who needed him at
8 the expense of his own safety; and
9 WHEREAS, Brandon Malone took immediate action and did everything in his
10 power to rescue the struggling girls. He was able to rescue the first girl, pulling her from
11 the frigid water and giving her his jacket, and immediately went back to save the second
12 girl who was trapped farther out in the lake; and
13 WHEREAS, Brandon Malone struggled to get through the frozen lake, and began
14 punching the ice to make a path to the second young girl. Knowing it was a life-or-death
15 situation, he kept fighting despite the freezing temperatures to get her to dry land as she
16 was turning purple. Brandon managed to break through the ice and pull the second girl to
17 shore, just in time for first responders to arrive; and
18 WHEREAS, Brandon Malone took swift, heroic action to save the lives of two
19 people that cold day in January. Thanks to Brandon's quick thinking and extreme
20 courage, the young girls he saved will have the opportunity to live healthy and fulfilling
21 lives;
22 NOW, THEREFORE,
23 Be it resolved by the Senate of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of
24 Kentucky:
25 Section 1. The Senate hereby honors the extraordinary courage and valor of
26 Brandon Malone, whose heroism saved the lives of two young girls, and whose actions
27 are an inspiration to all Kentuckians.
