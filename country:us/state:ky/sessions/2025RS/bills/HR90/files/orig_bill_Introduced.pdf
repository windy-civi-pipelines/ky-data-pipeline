UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1440
1 A RESOLUTION urging the Kentucky Congressional delegation to stand up for
2 Kentucky businesses and its economy.
3 WHEREAS, President Donald J. Trump issued a flurry of executive orders that
4 halted federal grants, rolled back health care protections provided by the Affordable Care
5 Act, rescinded an executive order lowering prescription drug costs for Medicare and
6 Medicaid recipients, issued tariffs against key trading partners, and established the
7 Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE); and
8 WHEREAS, Elon Musk, who heads DOGE, has been granted unprecedented power
9 to fundamentally and unilaterally transform the federal government, by firing federal
10 government workers, eliminating agencies outright, and obtaining access to sensitive
11 payment and data systems, including those managed by the Treasury Department,
12 Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security; and
13 WHEREAS, a United States District Judge recently found that Elon Musk, as the
14 head of DOGE, has been given "virtually unchecked authority...without proper legal
15 authorization from Congress and without meaningful supervision of his activities,"
16 raising serious legal and constitutional questions. Judge Tanya S. Chutkan expressed
17 concern over "what appears to be unchecked authority of an unelected individual and an
18 entity that was not created by Congress and over which it has no oversight."; and
19 WHEREAS, many of the government employees who were terminated were
20 probationary employees – workers who were hired in the last two years to provide health
21 care for veterans, protect our nuclear arsenal, and coordinate wildfire responses. These
22 workers bring specialized expertise, technological skills, and fresh ideas at a time when
23 the civil service is already facing a "silver tsunami" with twice as many employees over
24 the age of 60 than under 30; and
25 WHEREAS, Canada and Mexico have issued retaliatory tariffs; and
26 WHEREAS, over the course of 2023, the United States imported approximately
27 $3.1 trillion worth of goods; and

1 WHEREAS, the recent tariffs are essentially a tax that the average American and
2 average Kentuckian cannot afford. An estimate by the Tax Foundation found that the
3 proposed tariffs would increase taxes by $1.1 trillion between 2025 and 2034, amounting
4 to an average tax increase of more than $800 per household in the United States in 2025;
5 and
6 WHEREAS, tariffs can disrupt supply chains, leading to higher inflation and
7 preventing interest rate cuts, at a time when the people of this country and this
8 Commonwealth are struggling to afford necessities such as food, heat, gas, and groceries;
9 and
10 WHEREAS, recent economic studies of the impact of tariffs put in place during the
11 previous Trump administration show that consumers bore the brunt of the costs; and
12 WHEREAS, tariffs are expected to have a profound impact on the bourbon
13 industry, this Commonwealth's signature industry, which generates over 23,000 jobs,
14 with an annual payroll topping $1.63 billion, and over $358 million in annual tax revenue
15 for Kentucky state and local governments; and
16 WHEREAS, Kentucky Distillers' Association's president Eric Gregory warned that
17 tariffs would have "far reaching consequences" that could jeopardize growth for years to
18 come." Mr. Gregory also stated that "...the return of retaliatory tariffs on American
19 whisky will have far reaching consequences across Kentucky, home to 95% of the
20 world's bourbon...That means hard-working Americans – corn farmers, truckers,
21 distillery workers, barrel makers, bartenders, servers, and the communities and businesses
22 built around Kentucky bourbon will suffer."; and
23 WHEREAS, the actions taken by the Trump administration have brought chaos and
24 havoc to citizens of the United States and this Commonwealth who rely on government
25 services and benefits and temporarily stalled funding for infrastructure projects and
26 lifesaving medical research, left the livelihoods of millions of small business owners in
27 flux, undermined the privacy of citizens of the United States and this Commonwealth,
