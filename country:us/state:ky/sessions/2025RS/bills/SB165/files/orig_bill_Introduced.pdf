13 section, "cooperative board" has the same meaning as in Section 1 of this Act.
14 Section 7. KRS 161.030 is amended to read as follows:
15 (1) Notwithstanding the age of the pupil, the certification of all teachers and other
16 school personnel, in public schools only, is vested in the Education Professional
17 Standards Board. When so certified, teachers and other school personnel shall not
18 be required to have licensure, certification, or other forms of approval from any
19 other state agency for the performance of their respective assignments within the
20 system of public schools, except as provided for by law. All certificates authorized
21 under KRS 161.010 to 161.126 shall be issued in accordance with the
22 administrative regulations of the Education Professional Standards Board.[ After
23 July 15, 1994, all certificate applications and other data collection instruments of
24 the board shall include a request for voluntary information about the applicant's
25 ethnic background. This information shall be available to help local school districts
26 locate minority candidates. A person who holds a certificate prior to this
27 requirement may request that ethnic information be added to his or her file.]

1 [Nothing in ]This section shall not preclude the right of an individual in a nonpublic
2 school from seeking voluntary certification by the Education Professional Standards
3 Board.
4 (2) Certificates shall be issued upon written application and in accordance with statutes
5 and regulations in effect at the time of application to persons who have completed,
6 at colleges, universities, or local school district programs approved by the
7 Education Professional Standards Board for the preparation of teachers and other
8 school personnel, the curricula prescribed by the administrative regulations of the
9 Education Professional Standards Board.
10 (3) (a) Certification of all new teachers and teachers seeking additional certification
11 shall require the successful completion of appropriate assessments prior to
12 certification. The assessments shall be selected by the Education Professional
13 Standards Board and shall measure knowledge in the specific teaching field of
14 the applicant, including content of the field and teaching of that content. The
15 Education Professional Standards Board shall determine the minimum
16 acceptable level of achievement on each assessment. The assessments shall
17 measure those concepts, ideas, and facts which are being taught in teacher
18 education programs in Kentucky. Upon successful completion of the
19 assessments and the approved teacher preparation program, a professional
20 certificate valid for five (5) years shall be issued.
21 (b) If an applicant for teacher certification has completed the approved teacher
22 preparation program and has taken but failed to successfully complete the
23 appropriate assessments selected by the Education Professional Standards
24 Board, a conditional certificate may be issued for a period not to exceed one
25 (1) year. The employing school district, in collaboration with the teacher
26 education institution, shall provide technical assistance and mentoring support
27 to the conditionally certified teacher. The teacher shall retake the assessments

2 certificate shall not be reissued. Upon successful completion of the required
3 assessments, a professional certificate valid for five (5) years shall be issued.
4 The Education Professional Standards Board shall promulgate administrative
5 regulations to establish the standards and procedures for issuance of a
6 conditional certificate.
7 (c) If an out-of-state teacher with less than two (2) years' experience comes to
8 Kentucky after the deadline for taking the assessments, a temporary certificate
9 may be issued for a period up to six (6) months. The teacher shall take the
10 assessments during the period of the temporary certificate. If the teacher fails
11 the assessments, the temporary certificate shall be valid only for the current
12 semester. If the teacher passes the assessments, a professional certificate valid
13 for five (5) years shall be issued.
14 (4) A reasonable fee to be paid by the teacher and directly related to the actual cost of
15 the administration of the assessments shall be established by the Education
16 Professional Standards Board. Provisions shall be made for persons having less than
17 minimum levels of performance on any assessment to repeat that assessment, and
18 candidates shall be informed of their strengths and weaknesses in the specific
19 performance areas. The Education Professional Standards Board shall provide for
20 confidentiality of the individual assessment scores. Scores shall be available only to
21 the candidate and to the education officials who are responsible for determining
22 whether established certification standards have been met. Scores shall be used only
23 in the assessment for certification of new teachers and of out-of-state teachers with
24 less than two (2) years of teaching experience who are seeking initial certification
25 in Kentucky.
26 (5) Individuals who are participating in an alternative certification pathway, seeking
27 to transfer teaching certification from another state, or seeking initial

1 certification after completion of an out-of-state teacher preparation program,
2 shall successfully complete professional development training on Kentucky
3 education law approved by the Education Professional Standards Board. At a
4 minimum, the professional development training shall be two (2) hours long and
5 include a comprehensive overview of Section 2 of this Act and KRS 158.1415,
6 158.181 to 158.187, 158.188, 158.189, 158.190, 158.191, 158.192, 158.193, and
7 158.196.
8 (6) If an applicant establishes eligibility for a five (5) year professional certificate under
9 the provisions of subsection (3)(a) of this section, the applicant shall also be eligible
10 for the issuance of a certificate for substitute teaching as provided by the
11 administrative regulations of the Education Professional Standards Board.
12 (7)[(6)] (a) The Education Professional Standards Board shall issue a ten (10) year
13 emeritus certificate to an applicant who has:
14 1. Retired or will retire not more than one (1) year prior to the expiration
15 date of the certificate;
16 2. Met the requirements to receive an emeritus certificate as set forth in
17 administrative regulation promulgated by the Education Professional

2 certificate's expiration; and

4 KRS 161.120 apply.
5 (8)[(7)] The Education Professional Standards Board shall approve the curricula of
6 any college or university, or of any department thereof, for the training of teachers,
7 and any nontraditional or alternative teacher preparation program offered in a
8 public or private postsecondary education institution, private contractor, or state
9 agency, and shall also approve the curricula of any local district alternative
10 certification program, when the curricula comply with the administrative
11 regulations of the Education Professional Standards Board for the issuance of
12 certificates and when the institution has met the terms and conditions provided in
13 KRS 161.010 to 161.120. Any student who has completed any of these curricula, as
14 approved by the Education Professional Standards Board, and who has completed
15 the prescribed requirements for the issuance of certificates shall be granted a
16 certificate corresponding to the curricula completed.
17 (9)[(8)] The issuance of any certificate, except emergency certificates issued pursuant
18 to KRS 161.100, by the Education Professional Standards Board shall not be
19 dependent upon an offer of employment. The certification process, except for
20 emergency certificates, is independent of any job prospects and certification shall
21 be awarded on the basis of completing a teacher preparation program or an
22 alternative certification pathway and passing required assessments.
