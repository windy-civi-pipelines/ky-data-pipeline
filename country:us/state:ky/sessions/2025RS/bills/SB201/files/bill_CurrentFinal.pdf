1 AN ACT relating to workers' compensation.
2 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
3 Section 1. KRS 342.0011 is amended to read as follows:
4 As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires:
5 (1) "Injury" means any work-related traumatic event or series of traumatic events,
6 including cumulative trauma, arising out of and in the course of employment which
7 is the proximate cause producing a harmful change in the human organism
8 evidenced by objective medical findings. "Injury" does not include the effects of the
9 natural aging process, and does not include any communicable disease unless the
10 risk of contracting the disease is increased by the nature of the employment.
11 "Injury" when used generally, unless the context indicates otherwise, shall include
12 an occupational disease and damage to a prosthetic appliance, but shall not include
13 a psychological, psychiatric, or stress-related change in the human organism, unless
14 it is a direct result of a physical injury;
15 (2) "Occupational disease" means a disease arising out of and in the course of the
16 employment;
17 (3) An occupational disease as defined in this chapter shall be deemed to arise out of
18 the employment if there is apparent to the rational mind, upon consideration of all
19 the circumstances, a causal connection between the conditions under which the
20 work is performed and the occupational disease, and which can be seen to have
21 followed as a natural incident to the work as a result of the exposure occasioned by
22 the nature of the employment and which can be fairly traced to the employment as
23 the proximate cause. The occupational disease shall be incidental to the character of
24 the business and not independent of the relationship of employer and employee. An
25 occupational disease need not have been foreseen or expected but, after its
26 contraction, it must appear to be related to a risk connected with the employment
27 and to have flowed from that source as a rational consequence;

1 next calendar year as calculated by the commissioner using generally-accepted
2 actuarial methods as follows:
3 (a) The base period shall be the earliest three (3) calendar years of the five (5)
4 calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year for which the
5 calculation is made. The commissioner shall identify each claim of the
6 employer which has an injury date or date of last injurious exposure to the

16 premium is being calculated by the statewide average weekly wage in effect
17 during the year in which the injury or date of the last exposure occurred. The
18 total value of the claims using the adjusted weekly benefit shall then be
19 calculated by the commissioner. Values for claims in which awards have been

25 period;

2 Development, Education and Labor Cabinet. The commissioner shall multiply
3 each of the three (3) years of payroll by the number obtained by dividing the
4 statewide average weekly wage which will be in effect for the year in which
5 the premium is being calculated by the statewide average weekly wage in
6 effect in each of the years of the base period;
7 (c) The commissioner shall divide the total of the adjusted claim values for the
8 three (3) year base period by the total adjusted payroll for the same three (3)
9 year period. The value so calculated shall be multiplied by 1.25 and shall then
10 be multiplied by the employer's most recent annualized payroll, calculated
11 using records of the department and the Department of Workforce
12 Development data which shall be made available for this purpose on a
13 quarterly basis as reported, to obtain the premium for the next calendar year
14 for assessment purposes under KRS 342.122;
15 (d) For November 1, 1987, through December 31, 1988, premium for each
16 employer carrying its own risk shall be an amount calculated by the board
17 pursuant to the provisions contained in this subsection and such premium
18 shall be provided to each employer carrying its own risk and to the funding
19 commission on or before January 1, 1988. Thereafter, the calculations set
20 forth in this subsection shall be performed annually, at the time each employer
21 applies or renews its application for certification to carry its own risk for the
22 next twelve (12) month period and submits payroll and other data in support
23 of the application. The employer and the funding commission shall be notified
24 at the time of the certification or recertification of the premium calculated by
25 the commissioner, which shall form the employer's basis for assessments
26 pursuant to KRS 342.122 for the calendar year beginning on January 1
27 following the date of certification or recertification;

1 (e) If an employer having fewer than five (5) years of doing business in this state
2 applies to carry its own risk and is so certified, its premium for the purposes
3 of KRS 342.122 shall be based on the lesser number of years of experience as
4 may be available including the two (2) most recent years if necessary to create
5 a three (3) year base period. If the employer has less than two (2) years of
6 operation in this state available for the premium calculation, then its premium
7 shall be the greater of the value obtained by the calculation called for in this
8 subsection or the amount of security required by the commissioner pursuant to
9 KRS 342.340(1);
10 (f) If an employer is certified to carry its own risk after having previously insured
11 the risk, its premium shall be calculated using values obtained from claims
12 incurred while insured for as many of the years of the base period as may be
13 necessary to create a full three (3) year base. After the employer is certified to
14 carry its own risk and has paid all amounts due for assessments upon
15 premiums paid while insured, the employer shall be assessed only upon the
16 premium calculated under this subsection;

1 findings and opinions of the designated evaluator shall be afforded presumptive
2 weight by administrative law judges and the burden to overcome such findings and
3 opinions shall fall on the opponent of that evidence. When administrative law
4 judges reject the clinical findings and opinions of the designated evaluator, they
5 shall specifically state in the order the reasons for rejecting that evidence.
6 (3) The commissioner or an administrative law judge may, upon the application of any
7 party or upon his own motion, direct appointment by the commissioner, pursuant to
8 subsection (1) of this section, of a medical evaluator to make any necessary medical
9 examination of the employee. Such medical evaluator shall file with the

14 or carrier shall pay the cost of the examination. Upon notice from the commissioner
15 that an evaluation has been scheduled, the insurance carrier shall forward within
16 seven (7) days to the employee the expenses of travel necessary to attend the
17 evaluation at a rate equal to that paid to state employees for travel by private
18 automobile while conducting state business.
19 (5) Upon claims in which it is finally determined that the injured worker was not the
20 employee at the time of injury of an employer covered by this chapter, the special
21 fund shall reimburse the carrier for any evaluation performed pursuant to this
22 section for which the carrier has been erroneously compelled to make payment.
23 (6) Not less often than annually the designee of the secretary of the Cabinet for Health
24 and Family Services shall assess the performance of the medical schools and render
25 findings as to whether evaluations conducted under this section are being rendered
26 in a timely manner, whether examinations are conducted in accordance with
27 medically recognized techniques, whether impairment ratings are in conformity

1 with standards prescribed by the "Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent
2 Impairment," and whether coal workers' pneumoconiosis examinations are
3 conducted in accordance with the standards prescribed in this chapter.
4 (7) The General Assembly finds that good public policy mandates the realization of the
5 potential advantages, both economic and effectual, of the use of telehealth. The
6 commissioner may, to the extent that he or she finds it feasible and appropriate,
7 require the use of telehealth, as defined in KRS 211.332, in the independent medical
8 evaluation process required by this chapter.
