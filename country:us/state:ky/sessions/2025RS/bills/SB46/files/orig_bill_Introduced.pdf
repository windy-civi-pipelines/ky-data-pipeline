3 Section 1. KRS 403.730 is amended to read as follows:
4 (1) (a) The court shall review a petition for an order of protection immediately upon
5 its filing. If the review indicates that domestic violence and abuse exists, the
6 court shall summons the parties to an evidentiary hearing not more than
7 fourteen (14) days in the future. If the review indicates that such a basis does
8 not exist, the court may consider an amended petition or dismiss the petition
9 without prejudice.
10 (b) Service of the summons and hearing order under this subsection shall be made
11 upon the adverse party personally or in accordance with Rule 4.05 of the
12 Kentucky Rules of Civil Procedure, and may be made in the manner and by
13 the persons authorized to serve subpoenas under Rule 45.03 of the Kentucky
14 Rules of Civil Procedure. A summons may be reissued if service has not been
15 made on the adverse party by the fixed court date and time.
16 (2) (a) If the review under this section also indicates the presence of an immediate
17 and present danger of domestic violence and abuse, the court shall, upon the
18 filing of the petition, issue ex parte an emergency protective order that:
19 1. Authorizes relief appropriate to the situation utilizing the alternatives set
20 out in KRS 403.740, other than awarding temporary support or
21 counseling;
22 2. Sets forth which communications, if any, as requested by the petitioner,
23 are authorized and which communications are unauthorized;
24 3. Allows either party to retrieve his or her personal belongings from the
25 parties' shared residence and directs law enforcement to assist, if

1 section unless extended or withdrawn by subsequent order of the court;
2 and
3 5. Does not order or refer the parties to mediation unless requested by the
4 petitioner, and the court finds that:
5 a. The petitioner's request is voluntary and not the result of coercion;
6 and
7 b. Mediation is a realistic and viable alternative to or adjunct to the
8 issuance of an order sought by the petitioner.
9 Nothing in this paragraph shall be interpreted to place any restriction or
10 restraint on the petitioner.
11 (b) If an order is not issued under this subsection, the court shall note on the
12 petition, for the record, any action taken or denied and the reason for it.
13 Section 2. KRS 403.745 is amended to read as follows:

18 of Civil Procedure, whichever is earlier. A peace officer or court giving notice of
19 an unserved order shall make all reasonable efforts to arrange for the order's
20 personal service upon the respondent. Once effective, a peace officer or the court
21 may enforce the order's terms and act immediately upon their violation.
22 (2) Costs, fees, or bond shall not be assessed against or required of a petitioner for any
23 filing, hearing, service, or order authorized by or required to implement KRS
24 403.715 to 403.785.
