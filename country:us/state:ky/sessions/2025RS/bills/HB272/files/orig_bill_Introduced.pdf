1 AN ACT relating to reading and writing in schools.
2 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
3 Section 1. KRS 158.307 is amended to read as follows:
4 (1) As used in this section:
5 (a) "Dysgraphia" has the same meaning as in KRS 158.305;
6 (b) "Dyslexia" means a specific learning disability that is neurological in origin. It
7 is characterized by difficulties with accurate or fluent word recognition and by
8 poor spelling and decoding abilities. These difficulties typically result from a
9 deficit in the phonological component of language that is often unexpected in
10 relation to other cognitive abilities and the provision of effective classroom
11 instruction. Secondary consequences may include problems in reading
12 comprehension and reduced reading experience that can impede the growth of
13 vocabulary and background knowledge;
14 (c)[(b)] "Evidence-based" has the same meaning as in 20 U.S.C. sec. 7801(21);
15 and
16 (d)[(c)] "Phonemic awareness" means the ability to recognize that a spoken
17 word consists of a sequence of individual sounds and the ability to manipulate
18 individual sounds in speaking.
