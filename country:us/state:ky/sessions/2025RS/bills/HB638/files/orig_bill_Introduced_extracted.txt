18 expiration of the entitlement period shall continue to have coverage under the post-
19 retirement medical insurance program. Restrictions on employment shall remain in
20 effect until the member attains age seventy (70) or until the member's eligibility is
21 discontinued. KRS 161.520 and 161.525 shall not apply to survivors of disability
22 retirees whose retirement allowances have been recalculated at the expiration of the
23 entitlement period. Members who have their disability retirement allowance
24 recalculated at the expiration of their entitlement period shall be entitled to a
25 minimum monthly allowance of five hundred dollars ($500) as the basic straight
26 life annuity. The minimum allowance shall be effective July 1, 1992, and shall
27 apply to those members who have had their allowance recalculated prior to that date

1 and to disability retirees who will have their benefit allowance recalculated on or
2 after that date. For individuals who become members on or after July 1, 2021,
3 disability retirement payments and any other recurring payments payable by any
4 other state-administered retirement system shall be applied to reduce, on a dollar-
5 for-dollar basis, the minimum monthly disability retirement allowance payable
6 under this subsection.
7 (7) Effective July 1, 1992, members retired for disability prior to July 1, 1964, shall be
8 entitled to a minimum monthly allowance of five hundred dollars ($500) as their
9 basic straight life annuity and their surviving spouse shall be eligible for survivor
10 benefits as provided in KRS 161.520(1)(a) and (b).
11 (8) Any member retired by reason of disability may voluntarily waive disability
12 benefits and [return to teaching or ]any member, who is immediately eligible for
13 service retirement[age sixty (60) years or older], may elect to waive disability
14 benefits and retire for service on the basis of service credited to the member on the
15 effective date of the disability retirement.
16 (9) In order to qualify for retirement by reason of disability a member must suffer from
17 a physical or mental condition presumed to be permanent in duration and of a
18 nature as to render the member incapable of being gainfully employed in a covered
19 position. The incapability must be revealed by a competent examination by a
20 licensed physician or physicians and must be approved by a majority of a medical
21 review committee.
22 (10) A member retired by reason of disability shall be required to undergo periodic
23 examinations at the discretion of the board of trustees to determine whether the
24 disability allowance shall be continued. When examination and recommendation of
25 a medical review committee indicate the disability no longer exists, the allowance
26 shall be discontinued. Failure to undergo examinations and provide the Teachers'
27 Retirement System with requested medical documentation shall result in a

1 suspension of disability benefits.
2 (11) Eligibility for payment shall begin on the first day of the month following receipt of
3 the application in the Teachers' Retirement System office, or the first of the month
4 next following the last payment of salary or sick leave benefits by the employer,
5 whichever is the later date.
6 (12) No person who receives a disability allowance may be employed in a position that
7 entails duties or qualification requirements similar to positions subject to
8 participation in the retirement system either within or without the State of
9 Kentucky. So doing shall constitute a misdemeanor and shall result in loss of the
10 allowance from the first date of this service. For purposes of this subsection and
11 subsection (13) of this section, "employment" and "occupation," and derivatives
12 thereof, mean any activity engaged in by the member receiving disability allowance
13 from which income is earned. A member who applies for and is approved for
14 disability retirement on or after July 1, 2002, and whose annual disability benefit is
15 less than forty thousand dollars ($40,000) may earn income in any occupation other
16 than covered employment only to the extent that the annual income from the other
17 employment when added to the annual disability benefit does not exceed forty
18 thousand dollars ($40,000). For any member who exceeds this limit as a result of
19 income from other employment, the Kentucky Teachers' Retirement System shall
20 reduce the member's disability benefit on a dollar-for-dollar basis for each dollar
21 that the member's combined annual disability benefit and annual income from other
22 employment exceeds forty thousand dollars ($40,000). The board of trustees may
23 annually increase the forty thousand dollar ($40,000) limit by the percentage
24 increase in the annual average of the consumer price index for all urban consumers
25 for the most recent calendar year as published by the Federal Bureau of Labor
26 Statistics, not to exceed five percent (5%). The retirement system may require
27 income and employment verification from the member, including but not limited to
Page 46 of 58
XXXX 2/18/2025 9:39 AM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 802
1 copies of tax returns and federal forms W-2 and W-4P. Failure to provide the
2 Teachers' Retirement System with requested income and employment verification
3 documentation shall result in a suspension of disability benefits. Submission of
4 false or fraudulent documentation shall, in addition to criminal penalties, result
5 in disqualification of all disability benefits from the date the fraudulent
6 documentation was submitted.
7 (13) All members who applied for disability retirement before July 1, 2002, and were
8 approved as a result of that application shall be subject to the income limitations as
9 they existed on June 30, 2002, until July 1, 2006. Effective July 1, 2006, the
10 twenty-seven thousand dollar ($27,000) limitation shall be increased to forty
11 thousand dollars ($40,000) and may be adjusted by the board of trustees by the
12 consumer price index in the manner described in subsection (12) of this section.
13 The recipient of a disability allowance who engages in any gainful occupation other
14 than covered employment must make a report of the duties involved, compensation
15 received, and any other pertinent information required by the board of trustees. The
16 retirement system may require income and employment verification from the
17 member, including but not limited to copies of tax returns and federal forms W-2
18 and W-4P. Failure to provide the Teachers' Retirement System with requested
19 income and employment verification documentation shall result in a suspension
20 of disability benefits. Submission of false or fraudulent documentation shall, in
21 addition to criminal penalties, result in disqualification of all disability benefits
22 from the date the fraudulent documentation was submitted.
23 (14) The board of trustees shall designate medical review committees, each consisting of
24 three (3) licensed physicians. A medical review committee shall pass upon all
25 applications for disability retirement and upon all applicant statements, medical
26 certifications, and examinations submitted in connection with disability
27 applications. The disposition of each case shall be recommended by a medical
Page 47 of 58
XXXX 2/18/2025 9:39 AM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 802
1 review committee in writing to the retirement system. Members of a medical review
2 committee shall follow administrative regulations regarding procedures as the board
3 of trustees may enact and shall be paid reasonable fees and expenses as authorized
4 by the board of trustees in compliance with the provisions of KRS 161.330 and
5 161.340. The retirement system may secure additional medical examinations and
6 information as it deems necessary. A member may appeal any final agency decision
7 denying his or her disability retirement application pursuant to the provisions of
8 KRS 161.250(2). In the event of such an appeal, the member and his or her legal
9 counsel shall be entitled to all written recommendations and reports submitted by
10 the medical review committee to the Teachers' Retirement System. Such
11 recommendations and reports shall otherwise be maintained in a confidential
12 manner and shall not be subject to release under any conditions including in
13 response to a subpoena or order issued by a court of law notwithstanding any
14 other statute to the contrary.
15 (15) A disability may be presumed to be permanent if the condition creating the
16 disability may be reasonably expected to continue for one (1) year or more from the
17 date of application for disability benefits.
18 (16) Any member who has voluntarily waived disability benefits or whose disability
19 benefits have been discontinued on recommendation of a medical review
20 committee, may apply for reinstatement of disability benefits. The application for
21 reinstatement must be made to the retirement system within twelve (12) months of
22 the date disability benefits terminated. If the termination of benefits were voluntary,
23 the reinstatement may be made without medical examination if application is made
24 within three (3) months of the termination date. Other applications for reinstatement
25 will be processed in the same manner as new applications for benefits.
26 (17) No person who is receiving disability benefits under this section may be employed
27 in a position which qualifies the person for membership in a retirement system
Page 48 of 58
XXXX 2/18/2025 9:39 AM Jacketed

1 financed wholly or in part with public funds. Employment in a position prohibited
2 by this subsection shall result in disqualification for those disability benefits from
3 the date of employment in the prohibited position.
4 (18) Any person who is receiving benefits and becomes disqualified from receiving
5 those benefits under this section, or becomes disqualified from receiving a portion
6 of those benefits due to income from other than covered employment, shall
7 immediately notify the Teachers' Retirement System of this disqualification in
8 writing and shall return all benefits paid after the date of disqualification. Failure to
9 comply with these provisions shall create an indebtedness of that person to the
10 Teachers' Retirement System. Interest at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum,
11 beginning on the date the written notice of disqualification is sent, shall be
12 charged if the debt is not repaid within sixty (60) days after the date of written
13 notice of disqualification. Failure to repay this debt creates a lien in favor of the
14 Teachers' Retirement System upon all property of the person who improperly
15 receives benefits and does not repay those benefits. The Teachers' Retirement
16 System may, in order to collect an outstanding debt, reduce or terminate any benefit
17 that a member is otherwise entitled to receive.
18 (19) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section to the contrary, individuals who
19 become members on or after January 1, 2022, shall be eligible for an actuarially
20 determined disability benefit as prescribed by the board of trustees via
21 administrative regulations promulgated by the board. The board of trustees shall
22 arrange by appropriate contract or on a self-insured basis a disability plan to
23 provide the disability benefits and may adjust the benefits in accordance with KRS
24 161.633(3) or 161.634(3).
25 ïƒ¢Section 13. KRS 161.680 is amended to read as follows:
26 (1) If any change or error in a record results in any individual receiving from the
27 retirement system more or less than the individual was entitled to receive as

1 determined by the board of trustees or staff of the Teachers' Retirement System,
2 the board of trustees or staff shall, when the error is discovered, correct the error,
3 and as far as practicable adjust the payments so that the actuarial equivalent of the
4 benefit to which the individual was entitled shall be paid.
5 (2) The Teachers' Retirement System shall take all practicable and cost-effective steps
6 to collect overpayments from a member's or retiree's account. Methods of
7 correction of overpayments from any member's or retiree's account shall include but
8 are not limited to reclamation of the overpayment from the member's or retiree's
9 account at the depository bank, the deduction of moneys from account refunds,
10 deduction from the retirement allowance or joint and survivor annuity payable from
11 the account, and deduction of moneys from the life insurance benefit. Collection of

1 of this section, or when the member's eligibility for disability benefits is terminated
2 upon recommendation of a medical review committee, and this service shall be
3 used in calculating benefits as provided in subsection (5) of this section, but under
4 no circumstances shall this service be used to provide the member with more than
5 twenty-seven (27) years of total service credit. The service credit shall be valued at
6 the same level as service earned by active members as provided under KRS 161.600
7 or 161.620.
8 (5) Any member retired by reason of disability and remaining disabled at the expiration
9 of the entitlement period shall have his or her disability benefits recalculated using
10 the service retirement formula with service credit earned as set out in subsection (4)
11 of this section. The retirement allowance shall be calculated as set forth in KRS
12 161.620, except that those persons less than sixty (60) years of age shall be
13 considered as sixty (60) years of age. Members having their disability benefits
14 recalculated under this subsection shall not be entitled to a benefit based upon an
15 average of their three (3) highest salaries as set forth in KRS 161.220(9), unless
16 approved otherwise by the board of trustees.
17 (6) Members who have their disability retirement allowance recalculated at the
18 expiration of the entitlement period shall continue to have coverage under the post-
19 retirement medical insurance program. Restrictions on employment shall remain in
20 effect until the member attains age seventy (70) or until the member's eligibility is
21 discontinued. KRS 161.520 and 161.525 shall not apply to survivors of disability
22 retirees whose retirement allowances have been recalculated at the expiration of the
23 entitlement period. Members who have their disability retirement allowance
24 recalculated at the expiration of their entitlement period shall be entitled to a
25 minimum monthly allowance of five hundred dollars ($500) as the basic straight
26 life annuity. The minimum allowance shall be effective July 1, 1992, and shall
27 apply to those members who have had their allowance recalculated prior to that date

1 and to disability retirees who will have their benefit allowance recalculated on or
2 after that date. For individuals who become members on or after July 1, 2021,
3 disability retirement payments and any other recurring payments payable by any
4 other state-administered retirement system shall be applied to reduce, on a dollar-
5 for-dollar basis, the minimum monthly disability retirement allowance payable
6 under this subsection.
7 (7) Effective July 1, 1992, members retired for disability prior to July 1, 1964, shall be
8 entitled to a minimum monthly allowance of five hundred dollars ($500) as their
9 basic straight life annuity and their surviving spouse shall be eligible for survivor
10 benefits as provided in KRS 161.520(1)(a) and (b).
11 (8) Any member retired by reason of disability may voluntarily waive disability
12 benefits and [return to teaching or ]any member, who is immediately eligible for
13 service retirement[age sixty (60) years or older], may elect to waive disability
14 benefits and retire for service on the basis of service credited to the member on the
15 effective date of the disability retirement.
16 (9) In order to qualify for retirement by reason of disability a member must suffer from
17 a physical or mental condition presumed to be permanent in duration and of a
18 nature as to render the member incapable of being gainfully employed in a covered
19 position. The incapability must be revealed by a competent examination by a
20 licensed physician or physicians and must be approved by a majority of a medical
21 review committee.
22 (10) A member retired by reason of disability shall be required to undergo periodic
23 examinations at the discretion of the board of trustees to determine whether the
24 disability allowance shall be continued. When examination and recommendation of
25 a medical review committee indicate the disability no longer exists, the allowance
26 shall be discontinued. Failure to undergo examinations and provide the Teachers'
27 Retirement System with requested medical documentation shall result in a

1 suspension of disability benefits.
2 (11) Eligibility for payment shall begin on the first day of the month following receipt of
3 the application in the Teachers' Retirement System office, or the first of the month
4 next following the last payment of salary or sick leave benefits by the employer,
5 whichever is the later date.
6 (12) No person who receives a disability allowance may be employed in a position that
7 entails duties or qualification requirements similar to positions subject to
8 participation in the retirement system either within or without the State of
9 Kentucky. So doing shall constitute a misdemeanor and shall result in loss of the
10 allowance from the first date of this service. For purposes of this subsection and
11 subsection (13) of this section, "employment" and "occupation," and derivatives
12 thereof, mean any activity engaged in by the member receiving disability allowance
13 from which income is earned. A member who applies for and is approved for
14 disability retirement on or after July 1, 2002, and whose annual disability benefit is
15 less than forty thousand dollars ($40,000) may earn income in any occupation other
16 than covered employment only to the extent that the annual income from the other
17 employment when added to the annual disability benefit does not exceed forty
18 thousand dollars ($40,000). For any member who exceeds this limit as a result of
19 income from other employment, the Kentucky Teachers' Retirement System shall
20 reduce the member's disability benefit on a dollar-for-dollar basis for each dollar
21 that the member's combined annual disability benefit and annual income from other
22 employment exceeds forty thousand dollars ($40,000). The board of trustees may
23 annually increase the forty thousand dollar ($40,000) limit by the percentage
24 increase in the annual average of the consumer price index for all urban consumers
25 for the most recent calendar year as published by the Federal Bureau of Labor
26 Statistics, not to exceed five percent (5%). The retirement system may require
27 income and employment verification from the member, including but not limited to
Page 46 of 58

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 802
1 copies of tax returns and federal forms W-2 and W-4P. Failure to provide the
2 Teachers' Retirement System with requested income and employment verification
3 documentation shall result in a suspension of disability benefits. Submission of
4 false or fraudulent documentation shall, in addition to criminal penalties, result
5 in disqualification of all disability benefits from the date the fraudulent
6 documentation was submitted.
7 (13) All members who applied for disability retirement before July 1, 2002, and were
8 approved as a result of that application shall be subject to the income limitations as
9 they existed on June 30, 2002, until July 1, 2006. Effective July 1, 2006, the
10 twenty-seven thousand dollar ($27,000) limitation shall be increased to forty
11 thousand dollars ($40,000) and may be adjusted by the board of trustees by the
12 consumer price index in the manner described in subsection (12) of this section.
13 The recipient of a disability allowance who engages in any gainful occupation other
14 than covered employment must make a report of the duties involved, compensation
15 received, and any other pertinent information required by the board of trustees. The
16 retirement system may require income and employment verification from the
17 member, including but not limited to copies of tax returns and federal forms W-2
18 and W-4P. Failure to provide the Teachers' Retirement System with requested
19 income and employment verification documentation shall result in a suspension
20 of disability benefits. Submission of false or fraudulent documentation shall, in
21 addition to criminal penalties, result in disqualification of all disability benefits
22 from the date the fraudulent documentation was submitted.
23 (14) The board of trustees shall designate medical review committees, each consisting of
24 three (3) licensed physicians. A medical review committee shall pass upon all
25 applications for disability retirement and upon all applicant statements, medical
26 certifications, and examinations submitted in connection with disability
27 applications. The disposition of each case shall be recommended by a medical
Page 47 of 58

1 review committee in writing to the retirement system. Members of a medical review
2 committee shall follow administrative regulations regarding procedures as the board
3 of trustees may enact and shall be paid reasonable fees and expenses as authorized
4 by the board of trustees in compliance with the provisions of KRS 161.330 and
5 161.340. The retirement system may secure additional medical examinations and
6 information as it deems necessary. A member may appeal any final agency decision
7 denying his or her disability retirement application pursuant to the provisions of
8 KRS 161.250(2). In the event of such an appeal, the member and his or her legal
9 counsel shall be entitled to all written recommendations and reports submitted by
10 the medical review committee to the Teachers' Retirement System. Such
11 recommendations and reports shall otherwise be maintained in a confidential
12 manner and shall not be subject to release under any conditions including in
13 response to a subpoena or order issued by a court of law notwithstanding any
14 other statute to the contrary.
15 (15) A disability may be presumed to be permanent if the condition creating the
16 disability may be reasonably expected to continue for one (1) year or more from the
17 date of application for disability benefits.
18 (16) Any member who has voluntarily waived disability benefits or whose disability
19 benefits have been discontinued on recommendation of a medical review
20 committee, may apply for reinstatement of disability benefits. The application for
21 reinstatement must be made to the retirement system within twelve (12) months of
22 the date disability benefits terminated. If the termination of benefits were voluntary,
23 the reinstatement may be made without medical examination if application is made
24 within three (3) months of the termination date. Other applications for reinstatement
25 will be processed in the same manner as new applications for benefits.
26 (17) No person who is receiving disability benefits under this section may be employed
27 in a position which qualifies the person for membership in a retirement system

1 financed wholly or in part with public funds. Employment in a position prohibited
2 by this subsection shall result in disqualification for those disability benefits from
3 the date of employment in the prohibited position.
4 (18) Any person who is receiving benefits and becomes disqualified from receiving
5 those benefits under this section, or becomes disqualified from receiving a portion
6 of those benefits due to income from other than covered employment, shall
7 immediately notify the Teachers' Retirement System of this disqualification in
8 writing and shall return all benefits paid after the date of disqualification. Failure to
9 comply with these provisions shall create an indebtedness of that person to the
10 Teachers' Retirement System. Interest at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum,
11 beginning on the date the written notice of disqualification is sent, shall be
12 charged if the debt is not repaid within sixty (60) days after the date of written
13 notice of disqualification. Failure to repay this debt creates a lien in favor of the
14 Teachers' Retirement System upon all property of the person who improperly
15 receives benefits and does not repay those benefits. The Teachers' Retirement
16 System may, in order to collect an outstanding debt, reduce or terminate any benefit
17 that a member is otherwise entitled to receive.
18 (19) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section to the contrary, individuals who
19 become members on or after January 1, 2022, shall be eligible for an actuarially
20 determined disability benefit as prescribed by the board of trustees via
21 administrative regulations promulgated by the board. The board of trustees shall
22 arrange by appropriate contract or on a self-insured basis a disability plan to
23 provide the disability benefits and may adjust the benefits in accordance with KRS
24 161.633(3) or 161.634(3).
25 ïƒ¢Section 13. KRS 161.680 is amended to read as follows:
26 (1) If any change or error in a record results in any individual receiving from the
27 retirement system more or less than the individual was entitled to receive as

1 determined by the board of trustees or staff of the Teachers' Retirement System,
2 the board of trustees or staff shall, when the error is discovered, correct the error,
3 and as far as practicable adjust the payments so that the actuarial equivalent of the
4 benefit to which the individual was entitled shall be paid.
5 (2) The Teachers' Retirement System shall take all practicable and cost-effective steps
6 to collect overpayments from a member's or retiree's account. Methods of
7 correction of overpayments from any member's or retiree's account shall include but
8 are not limited to reclamation of the overpayment from the member's or retiree's
9 account at the depository bank, the deduction of moneys from account refunds,
10 deduction from the retirement allowance or joint and survivor annuity payable from
11 the account, and deduction of moneys from the life insurance benefit. Collection of
