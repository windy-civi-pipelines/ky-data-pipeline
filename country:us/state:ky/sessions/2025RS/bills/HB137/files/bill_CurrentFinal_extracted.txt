2 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
3 Section 1. KRS 77.155 is amended to read as follows:
4 (1) A person shall not, nor shall an agent or employee of a person, nor shall a person as
5 agent or employee of another, discharge into the atmosphere from any single source
6 of emission whatsoever, any air contaminant in quantities and for a period or
7 periods in excess of applicable emission standards established by regulation by the
8 air pollution control board. Exceeding these standards shall constitute a rebuttable
9 presumption of violation of this section.
10 (2) A person shall not, nor shall an agent or employee of a person, nor shall a person as
11 agent or employee of another, discharge from any source whatsoever such
12 quantities of air contaminants or other material which cause injury, detriment,
13 nuisance, or annoyance to any considerable number of persons or to the public or
14 which endanger the comfort, repose, health, or safety of any such persons or the
15 public or which cause or have a natural tendency to cause injury or damage to
16 business or property. The board shall have power, by regulation, to fix reasonable
17 limits, by weight or otherwise, for particular air contaminants or other material
18 which in the opinion of said board may cause or have tendency to cause injury,
19 detriment, nuisance, or annoyance to any considerable number of persons or to the
20 public. Exceeding such limits shall be a rebuttable presumption of violation of this
21 section.
22 (3) (a) For purposes of enforcing compliance with the applicable requirements of
23 this chapter, the administrative regulations promulgated thereunder, or any
24 requirement of the federal Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. sec. 7401 et seq., for
25 which the air pollution control board has primary enforcement authority,
26 an enforcement action alleging violations or noncompliance shall be based

23 being cleaned out and a new fire is being built therein, in which event a smoke of a
24 density as great or greater than that established by regulation by the air pollution
25 control board shall be permitted for a period not to exceed six (6) minutes in any
26 single period of sixty (60) minutes;
27 (3) To equipment used for agricultural operations in the growing of crops, or raising of

1 fowl or animals;
2 (4) To smoke from fires set by or permitted by any public officer if such fire is set or
3 permission given in the performance of the official duty of such officer for the
4 purpose of weed abatement, the prevention of a fire or health hazard, or the

6 opinion of such officer, necessary.
7 Section 3. KRS 224.20-110 is amended to read as follows:
8 (1) No person shall, directly or indirectly, emit into or discharge into the air under the
9 jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, or cause, permit, or allow to be emitted or
10 discharged into such air any contaminants as provided for in subsection (1) of KRS
11 224.1-010 that shall cause or contribute to the pollution of the air of the
12 Commonwealth in contravention of the emission standards or the ambient air
13 standards adopted by the cabinet, or in contravention of any of the rules,
14 regulations, or orders of the cabinet, or in contravention of any of the provisions of
15 this chapter.
16 (2) (a) For purposes of enforcing compliance with the applicable requirements of
