6 of emission whatsoever, any air contaminant in quantities and for a period or
7 periods in excess of applicable emission standards established by regulation by the

13 nuisance, or annoyance to any considerable number of persons or to the public or
14 which endanger the comfort, repose, health, or safety of any such persons or the
15 public or which cause or have a natural tendency to cause injury or damage to
16 business or property. The board shall have power, by regulation, to fix reasonable
17 limits, by weight or otherwise, for particular air contaminants or other material
18 which in the opinion of said board may cause or have tendency to cause injury,
19 detriment, nuisance, or annoyance to any considerable number of persons or to the
20 public. Exceeding such limits shall be a rebuttable presumption of violation of this
21 section.
22 (3) (a) For purposes of determining compliance with this chapter, the
23 administrative regulations promulgated thereunder, or any requirement of
24 the federal Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. sec. 7401 et seq., for which the air

13 building under common control; or
14 (b) At the time of the renovation, demolition, or cleanup, the use of the building
15 or the property is commercial or is not known. To all larger residential
16 buildings of whatever type, KRS 77.155 shall be effective and applicable;
17 (2) When a firebox, furnace, boiler, locomotive, or other fuel-consuming device is
18 being cleaned out and a new fire is being built therein, in which event a smoke of a

22 (3) To equipment used for agricultural operations in the growing of crops, or raising of
23 fowl or animals;
24 (4) To smoke from fires set by or permitted by any public officer if such fire is set or
