(c) The State Board of Elections shall promulgate an administrative regulation under KRS Chapter 13A
establishing evaluation procedures which county boards of elections may use to qualify persons

(2) The county executive committees of the two (2) political parties having representation on the State Board of
Elections may, on or before March 15 each year, designate in writing to the county board of elections a list of
not less than four (4) names for each precinct; except that, in any precinct where there are not as many as four
(4) persons possessing the qualifications of an election officer belonging to the political party filing the list, or

The lists shall contain the full name, address, phone number, and Social Security number, if available, of each
person listed. The lists shall be accompanied by a signed statement from each person stating that he or she is
willing to serve, has not failed to serve without excuse in the past, and has not been convicted of an election
law offense or any felony, unless the person's civil rights have been restored by the Governor. The State Board
of Elections shall prescribe the form of the list by administrative regulation promulgated under KRS Chapter
13A.
(3) The Attorney General shall notify each party state central committee of the duties of the party.

(d) The county board of elections shall, when possible, also appoint an adequate number of alternate
precinct election officers from names on the lists which were submitted but which were not selected by

from the lists of nominees who were not selected as precinct election officers, the county board of
elections shall submit its method of selecting alternate precinct election officers to the State Board of

county, the county board of elections shall submit a list of emergency election officer appointments to the
State Board of Elections. The county board of elections shall also present, in writing, its efforts to recruit and
appoint election officers as prescribed in subsection (4) of this section. The State Board of Elections, after its
review, may approve any or all of the emergency appointments submitted by the county board of elections or
may direct the county board to take other action. Any emergency appointment shall be made for the next
ensuing election only.
(6) In addition to precinct election officers appointed under subsection (1) of this section, a county board of
elections or the county clerk may appoint up to two (2) additional precinct election officers per precinct with
the approval of the State Board of Elections. The State Board of Elections shall promulgate an administrative
regulation under KRS Chapter 13A establishing conditions under which additional precinct officers may be

officer who is a minor seventeen (17) years of age.
(c) An election officer shall not be a candidate for office during the election year.
(d) An election officer shall not be the spouse, parent, brother, sister, or child of a candidate who is to be
voted for at the election in the precinct in which the election officer will serve on election day.

31 immediately preceding his or her appointment to serve for the primary, or after the second Tuesday
in August to serve for the regular election.

election officers and if the vacancy occurs in the appointment of a judge, the person appointed to fill the
CHAPTER 125 3
vacancy shall be of the same political affiliation as the vacating officer, except for emergency
appointments made as provided in subsection (5) of this section.
(10) If the county board of elections or the county clerk fails to appoint election officers, or if any officer is not
present at the precinct at the time for commencing the election, or refuses to act, and if no alternate is
available, the officer in attendance representing the political party of the absentee shall appoint a suitable
person to act in his or her place for that election. If both representatives of the same political party are absent,
qualified voters present affiliating with that party shall elect, viva voce, suitable persons to act in their places.
(11) Each election officer shall be paid a minimum of sixty dollars ($60) per election day served, and such an
additional amount as compensation as may be determined by the county board of elections, with the approval
of the governing body which would be responsible for funding the election officers' pay, for each election in
which the election officer serves, to be paid by the county. For delivering the election packets to the polls, the
precinct election officers shall additionally receive the mileage reimbursement provided for state employees,
for each mile necessarily traveled in the delivery of the packets to the polls, or a flat fee if the fee equals or
exceeds that amount. For delivering election returns, the precinct election judges shall additionally receive the
mileage reimbursement provided for state employees for each mile necessarily traveled in the delivery of
election returns, or a flat fee if the fee equals or exceeds that amount. The fee paid to the precinct election
judges for delivering election returns shall be paid by the county.
Section 2. KRS 117.065 is amended to read as follows:
(1) The county board of elections shall, not later than January 15 of each year, establish the voting place for each
precinct. If a change becomes necessary after that date, notice of change shall be published pursuant to KRS
Chapter 424. If a change becomes necessary on election day, notice shall be posted at the former voting place.
The expense of renting voting places, for which rent of not less than twenty dollars ($20) shall be paid, shall be
paid in the same manner as other election expenses.
(2) The county board of elections shall have the authority to designate as voting places, on election day and all
days of excused and no-excuse in-person absentee voting, without cost to the board, buildings constructed in
whole or in part with tax revenues.
(3) The county board of elections shall notify a local board of education that it intends to designate one (1) or

capable of providing or accepting separate ballots without endangering the integrity of the ballots or without
violating any other election law.
(2) If a single voting location for more than one (1) precinct is approved under subsection (3) of this section, the
primary or election shall be conducted as follows:
(a) One (1) voting equipment may be used for more than one (1) precinct if ballots are tabulated for each
separate precinct, and if separate ballots may be placed upon any voting equipment to be used without
endangering the integrity of the ballots or without violating any other election law. Otherwise, separate
voting equipment shall be used for each precinct. In the instance of a precinct which has a small number
of voters such that the use of separate voting equipment would be cost-prohibitive, the county clerk may
make application to the State Board of Elections to use supplemental paper ballots under KRS 118.215
to conduct the voting for the small precinct on any primary or election day. If the use of supplemental
paper ballots is approved by the State Board of Elections, at the close of voting on any primary or
election day, the locked supplemental paper ballot box shall be transported to the county board of
elections along with the federal provisional ballot receptacle, and ballots shall be counted by the county
board of elections as provided by KRS 117.275(9) to (15)[(10) to (16)];

voter intent;
(e) Once the hand-to-eye audit[recount] is completed, each volunteer shall add up the tally marks for each
candidate, write down a total number of votes for each candidate, and sign the tally sheet. The county
board of elections or its designee shall verify if the two (2) separate hand-to-eye tallies match. If the two
(2) hand-to-eye tallies do not match each other, the process must be repeated until the totals are
matching. Once this occurs, the county board of elections or its designee shall also verify the tallies by
signing each tally sheet. Then, the ballots must be returned to the ballot box and resealed in the
presence of the county board of elections or its designee and public witnesses;
(f) The county board of elections or its designee shall compare the signed register tape total from the vote
tabulation machine on election day to the hand-to-eye tallies. If there is a discrepancy between the

the number of voters on the sign-in records for the precinct or vote center, the county board of elections
shall open an election investigation and report the findings to the Attorney General and Secretary of
State;
(9) Provide a method for maintaining sufficient documents, including ballots and records, so that votes can be

1. State and local requirements under this section are met regarding the equivalent of the number
and length of student attendance days, teacher professional days, professional development days,
holidays, and days for planning activities without the presence of students; and

Section 73:

any emergency, as approved by the Kentucky Department of Education when required, including
but not limited to a provision for additional instructional time per day, are met.

make application to the State Board of Elections to use supplemental paper ballots under KRS 118.215
to conduct the voting for the small precinct on any primary or election day. If the use of supplemental
paper ballots is approved by the State Board of Elections, at the close of voting on any primary or

voter intent;
(e) Once the hand-to-eye audit[recount] is completed, each volunteer shall add up the tally marks for each
candidate, write down a total number of votes for each candidate, and sign the tally sheet. The county
board of elections or its designee shall verify if the two (2) separate hand-to-eye tallies match. If the two
(2) hand-to-eye tallies do not match each other, the process must be repeated until the totals are
matching. Once this occurs, the county board of elections or its designee shall also verify the tallies by
signing each tally sheet. Then, the ballots must be returned to the ballot box and resealed in the
presence of the county board of elections or its designee and public witnesses;
(f) The county board of elections or its designee shall compare the signed register tape total from the vote
tabulation machine on election day to the hand-to-eye tallies. If there is a discrepancy between the

the number of voters on the sign-in records for the precinct or vote center, the county board of elections
shall open an election investigation and report the findings to the Attorney General and Secretary of
State;

necessary, provided the amended calendar complies with the requirements of a student instructional
year in subsection (1)(f) of this section or a variable student instructional year in subsection (1)(h) of

CHAPTER 125 27
delivery option, including providing services during the student attendance day on a limited basis. These
grants shall be allotted to school districts to provide instructional programs for pupils who are identified as
needing additional time to achieve the outcomes defined in KRS 158.6451. A school district that has a school
operating a model early reading program under KRS 158.792 may use a portion of its grant money as part of

school district shall arrange bus schedules so that all buses arrive in sufficient time to provide breakfast prior
to the beginning of the student attendance day. The superintendent of a school district that participates in the
