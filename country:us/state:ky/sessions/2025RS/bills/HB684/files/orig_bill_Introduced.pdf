20 the use of student attendance days as a result of a local emergency, as
21 described in subsection (3)(f)2. of this section, and regulations setting forth
22 the guidelines and procedures to be observed for the approval of waivers from

1 days by thirty (30) minutes or more, as it deems necessary, provided the
2 amended calendar complies with the requirements of a student instructional
3 year in subsection (1)(f) of this section or a variable student instructional year
4 in subsection (1)(h) of this section. No student attendance day shall contain
5 more than seven (7) hours of instructional time unless the district submitted
6 and received approval from the commissioner of education for an innovative
7 alternative calendar.
8 (5) (a) 1. In setting the school calendar, school may be closed for two (2)
9 consecutive days for the purpose of permitting professional school
10 employees to attend statewide professional meetings.
11 2. These two (2) days for statewide professional meetings may be
12 scheduled to begin with the first Thursday after Easter, or upon request
13 of the statewide professional education association having the largest
14 paid membership, the commissioner of education may designate
15 alternate dates.
16 3. If schools are scheduled to operate during days designated for the
17 statewide professional meeting, the school district shall permit
18 employees who are delegates to attend as compensated professional
19 leave time and shall employ substitute teachers in their absence.
20 4. The commissioner of education shall designate one (1) additional day
21 during the school year when schools may be closed to permit
22 professional school employees to participate in regional or district
23 professional meetings.
24 5. These three (3) days so designated for attendance at professional
25 meetings may be counted as a part of the minimum school term.
26 (b)[ 1.] If any school in a district is used as a voting[polling] place
27 pursuant to Section 2 of this Act, the school district may[shall] be

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 367
1 closed on the days[day] of the election, and those days may be used for
2 professional development activities, professional meetings, or parent-
3 teacher conferences.[
4 2. A district may be open on the day of an election if no school in the
5 district is used as a polling place.]
6 (c) All schools shall be closed on the third Monday of January in observance of
7 the birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr. Districts may:
8 1. Designate the day as one (1) of the four (4) holidays permitted under

17 competes in a regional tournament or state tournament sanctioned by the
18 Kentucky Board of Education, or the organization or agency designated by the
19 board to manage interscholastic athletics, and occurring on a regularly
20 scheduled student attendance day may be counted present at school on the
21 date or dates of the competition, as determined by local board policy, for a
22 maximum of two (2) days per student per year. The student shall be expected
23 to complete any assignments missed on the date or dates of the competition.
24 (c) The school attendance record of any student for whom paragraph (b) of this
25 subsection applies shall indicate that the student was in attendance on the date
26 or dates of competition.
27 (7) Schools shall provide continuing education for those students who are determined

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 367
1 to need additional time to achieve the outcomes defined in KRS 158.6451, and
2 schools shall not be limited to the minimum school term in providing this
3 education. Continuing education time may include extended days, extended weeks,
4 or extended years. A local board of education may adopt a policy requiring its
5 students to participate in continuing education. The local policy shall set out the
6 conditions under which attendance will be required and any exceptions which are
7 provided. The Kentucky Board of Education shall promulgate administrative
8 regulations establishing criteria for the allotment of grants to local school districts
9 and shall include criteria by which the commissioner of education may approve a
10 district's request for a waiver to use an alternative service delivery option, including
11 providing services during the student attendance day on a limited basis. These
12 grants shall be allotted to school districts to provide instructional programs for
13 pupils who are identified as needing additional time to achieve the outcomes
14 defined in KRS 158.6451. A school district that has a school operating a model
15 early reading program under KRS 158.792 may use a portion of its grant money as
16 part of the matching funds to provide individualized or small group reading
17 instruction to qualified students outside of the regular classroom during the student
18 attendance day.
19 (8) Notwithstanding any other statute, each school term shall include no less than the
20 equivalent of the student instructional year in subsection (1)(f) of this section, or a
21 variable student instructional year in subsection (1)(h) of this section, except that
22 the commissioner of education may grant up to the equivalent of ten (10) student
23 attendance days for school districts that have a nontraditional instruction plan
24 approved by the commissioner of education on days when the school district is
25 closed for health or safety reasons. The district's plan shall indicate how the
26 nontraditional instruction process shall be a continuation of learning that is
27 occurring on regular student attendance days. Instructional delivery methods,
Page 59 of 62
XXXX 2/17/2025 4:41 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 367
1 including the use of technology, shall be clearly delineated in the plan. Average
2 daily attendance for purposes of Support Education Excellence in Kentucky
3 program funding during the student attendance days granted shall be calculated in
4 compliance with administrative regulations promulgated by the Kentucky Board of
5 Education.
6 (9) The Kentucky Board of Education shall promulgate administrative regulations to
7 prescribe the conditions and procedures for districts to be approved for the
8 nontraditional instruction program. Administrative regulations promulgated by the
9 board under this section shall specify:
10 (a) The application, plan review, approval, and amendment process;
11 (b) Reporting requirements for districts approved for the program, which may
12 include but are not limited to examples of student work, lesson plans, teacher
13 work logs, and student and teacher participation on nontraditional instruction
14 days. Documentation to support the use of nontraditional instruction days
15 shall include clear evidence of learning continuation;
16 (c) Timelines for initial approval as a nontraditional instruction district, length of
17 approval, the renewal process, and ongoing evaluative procedures required of
18 the district;
19 (d) Reporting and oversight responsibilities of the district and the Kentucky
20 Department of Education, including the documentation required to show clear
21 evidence of learning continuation during nontraditional instruction days; and
22 (e) Other components deemed necessary to implement this section.
23 (10) Notwithstanding the provisions of KRS 158.060(3) and the provisions of subsection
24 (2) of this section, a school district shall arrange bus schedules so that all buses
25 arrive in sufficient time to provide breakfast prior to the beginning of the student
26 attendance day. The superintendent of a school district that participates in the
27 Federal School Breakfast Program may also authorize up to fifteen (15) minutes of
Page 60 of 62

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 367
1 the student attendance day to provide the opportunity for children to eat breakfast
2 during instructional time.
3 (11) Notwithstanding any other statute to the contrary, the following provisions shall
4 apply to a school district that misses student attendance days due to emergencies,
5 including weather-related emergencies:
6 (a) A certified school employee shall be considered to have fulfilled the
7 minimum one hundred eighty-five (185) day contract with a school district
8 under KRS 157.350 and shall be given credit for the purpose of calculating
9 service credit for retirement under KRS 161.500 for certified school personnel
10 if:
11 1. State and local requirements under this section are met regarding the
12 equivalent of the number and length of student attendance days, teacher
13 professional days, professional development days, holidays, and days
14 for planning activities without the presence of students; and
15 2. The provisions of the district's school calendar to make up student
16 attendance days missed due to any emergency, as approved by the
17 Kentucky Department of Education when required, including but not
18 limited to a provision for additional instructional time per day, are met.
19 (b) Additional time worked by a classified school employee shall be considered
20 as equivalent time to be applied toward the employee's contract and
21 calculation of service credit for classified employees under KRS 78.615 if:
22 1. The employee works for a school district with a school calendar
23 approved by the Kentucky Department of Education that contains a
24 provision that additional instructional time per day shall be used to make
25 up full days missed due to an emergency;
26 2. The employee's contract requires a minimum six (6) hour work day; and
27 3. The employee's job responsibilities and work day are extended when the
Page 61 of 62

1 instructional time is extended for the purposes of making up time.
2 (c) Classified employees who are regularly scheduled to work less than six (6)
3 hours per day and who do not have additional work responsibilities as a result
4 of lengthened student attendance days shall be excluded from the provisions
5 of this subsection. These employees may be assigned additional work
6 responsibilities to make up service credit under KRS 78.615 that would be
7 lost due to lengthened student attendance days.
