10 openings created by the resignation, dismissal, nonrenewal of contract,
11 transfer, or death of a certified staff member, or creation of a new position for
12 which certification is required, a vacancy shall not exist, unless certified
13 positions remain open after compliance with those procedures.
14 (2) Except as provided in KRS 160.346, the school district personnel actions identified
15 in this section shall be carried out as follows:
16 (a) All appointments, promotions, and transfers of principals, supervisors,
17 teachers, and other public school employees shall be made only by the

25 another position within the school district;
26 (b) When a vacancy occurs in a local school district, the superintendent shall
27 submit the job posting to the statewide job posting system described in KRS

7 officer. If the waiver is approved, the appointment shall not be made until the
8 person recommended for the position has been approved by the chief state
9 school officer. The chief state school officer shall respond to a district's
10 request for waiver or for approval of an appointment within two (2) working
11 days; and
