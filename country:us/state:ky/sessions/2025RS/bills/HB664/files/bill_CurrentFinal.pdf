2 case involves allegations of dependency, neglect, or abuse, no emergency removal
3 or temporary custody orders shall be effective unless the provisions of KRS Chapter
4 620 are followed. Such orders shall be entirely without prejudice to the proceedings
5 for permanent custody of the child and shall remain in effect until modified or set
6 aside by the court. Upon the entry of a temporary or final judgment in the Circuit
7 Court awarding custody of such child, all prior orders of the juvenile session of the
8 District Court in conflict therewith shall be deemed canceled. This section shall not
9 work to deprive the Circuit Court of jurisdiction over cases filed in Circuit Court.
10 (10) The court of each county wherein a public offense, as defined in subsection (1) of
11 this section, is committed by a child who is a resident of another county of this state
12 shall have concurrent jurisdiction over such child with the court of the county
13 wherein the child resides or the court of the county where the child is found.
14 Whichever court first acquires jurisdiction of such child may proceed to final
15 disposition of the case, or in its discretion may make an order transferring the case
16 to the court of the county of the child's residence or the county wherein the offense
17 was committed, as the case may be.
18 (11) Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the court from holding a child in contempt of
19 court to enforce valid court orders previously issued by the court, subject to the
20 requirements contained in KRS 610.265 and 630.080.
21 (12) Except as provided in KRS 635.060(4), 630.120(5), or 635.090, nothing in this
22 chapter shall confer upon the District Court or the family division of the Circuit
23 Court, as appropriate, jurisdiction over the actions of the Department of Juvenile
24 Justice or the cabinet in the placement, care, or treatment of a child committed to
25 the Department of Juvenile Justice or committed to or in the custody of the cabinet;
26 or to require the department or the cabinet to perform, or to refrain from
27 performing, any specific act in the placement, care, or treatment of any child
