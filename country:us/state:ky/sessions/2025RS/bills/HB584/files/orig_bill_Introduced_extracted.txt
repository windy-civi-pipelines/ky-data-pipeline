15 (c) The Kentucky Board of Education shall not itself operate leased television
16 facilities, or undertake the preparation of the educational presentations or

5 Property and Buildings Commission shall bind the board to pay rentals for
6 more than one (1) fiscal biennium at a time, subject to the aforesaid renewal
7 options. The board may receive and may apply to rental payments under any
8 lease and to the cost of providing for the operation of the television or related
9 facilities not only appropriations which may be made to it from state funds,
10 from time to time, but also contributions, gifts, matching funds, devises, and
11 bequests from any source, whether federal or state, and whether public or
12 private, so long as the same are not conditioned upon any improper use of the
13 television or related facilities in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of
14 this subsection.

16 state school officer, prescribe, print, publish, and distribute at public expense such
17 administrative regulations, courses of study, curriculums, bulletins, programs,
