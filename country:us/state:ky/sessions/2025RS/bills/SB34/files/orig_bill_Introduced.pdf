14 statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
15 accepted in the United States of America, as of January 1, 2019, shall be
16 eligible for this deduction.
17 4. If the provisions of KRS 141.202 result in an aggregate increase to the
18 member's net deferred tax liability, an aggregate decrease to the
19 member's net deferred tax asset, or an aggregate change from a net
20 deferred tax asset to a net deferred tax liability, the combined group
21 shall be entitled to a deduction, as determined in this paragraph.
22 5. For ten (10) years beginning with the combined group's first taxable
23 year beginning on or after January 1, 2026, a combined group shall be

1 liability. The increase in the net deferred tax liability, decrease in the net
2 deferred tax asset, or the aggregate change from a net deferred tax asset

5 under KRS 141.202, but for the deduction provided under this paragraph
6 as of June 27, 2019.
7 6. The deferred tax impact determined in subparagraph 5. of this paragraph
8 shall be converted to the annual deferred tax deduction amount, as
9 follows:
10 a. The deferred tax impact determined in subparagraph 5. of this
11 paragraph shall be divided by the tax rate determined under KRS
12 141.040;
13 b. The resulting amount shall be further divided by the
14 apportionment factor determined by KRS 141.120 or 141.121 that
15 was used by the combined group in the calculation of the deferred
16 tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as described in subparagraph
17 5. of this paragraph; and
18 c. The resulting amount represents the total net deferred tax
19 deduction available over the ten (10) year period as described in
20 subparagraph 5. of this paragraph.
21 7. The deduction calculated under this paragraph shall not be adjusted as a
22 result of any events happening subsequent to the calculation, including
23 but not limited to any disposition or abandonment of assets. The
24 deduction shall be calculated without regard to the federal tax effect and
25 shall not alter the tax basis of any asset. If the deduction under this
26 section is greater than the combined group's entire Kentucky net income,
27 any excess deduction shall be carried forward and applied as a deduction

1 to the combined group's entire net income in future taxable years until
