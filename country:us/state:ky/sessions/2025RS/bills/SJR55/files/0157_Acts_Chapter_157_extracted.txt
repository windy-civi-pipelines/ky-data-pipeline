WHEREAS, the Combat Antisemitism Movement's Antisemitism Research Center reports a total of 6,326
antisemitic incidents in 2024, representing a 107.7 percent increase from 2023, and 742 incidents on American
college campuses in 2024, a 200 percent increase compared to 2022; and
WHEREAS, in 2021 both chambers of the Kentucky General Assembly passed resolutions adopting the
International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism and encouraging public officials, including
the presidents of our public postsecondary education institutions, to ensure that the Commonwealth of Kentucky will
live up to the transcendent principles of religious freedom and equal protection as embodied in the Constitution; and
WHEREAS, protecting the right of students to access Kentucky's public postsecondary education institutions

Section 1. By January 1, 2026, the governing board of each of Kentucky's public postsecondary education
institutions shall adopt policies to combat antisemitism within their institutions that use as guidance the definition of
"antisemitism" as established by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance and recognized in 2021 Regular
Session Senate Resolution 67 and the institutions shall adhere to the First Amendment. The institutions shall
implement these policies through June 30, 2028, and may continue implementation thereafter. Policies shall require:
(1) At the start of each semester, notifying all students:
(a) Of the rights that are protected at the institution under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and how
a student may file a complaint if the student believes those rights have been violated;
(b) That KRS 344.450 provides any person injured by certain acts of discrimination with a civil cause of
action to enjoin further violations and to recover the actual damages sustained and the costs of the law suit; and
(c) Of the institution's policies regarding student-on-student harassment;
(2) The identification of all Jewish groups that seek to serve Jewish students attending the institution as
community resources to the same extent as any other religious organization is recognized by the institution as a
community resource;
(3) The defunding and disbanding of any student organization that has been found by an institution to be
providing material support or resources to a designated terrorist organization and the reporting of those activities to
appropriate law enforcement authorities; and
(4) The collection of data of:
(a) The number of reports alleging antisemitism submitted to the institution, the number of investigations
opened by the institution as a result of those reports, and the outcomes of those investigations;
(b) The number of reports alleging violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that are connected
to antisemitism of which the institution has been notified and the results of those investigations that are in the
possession of the institution; and
(c) The number of actions that have been brought against the institution under KRS 344.450 and the
outcomes of such actions.
