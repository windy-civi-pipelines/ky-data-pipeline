2. On an informed basis; and
3. In a manner he or she honestly believes to be in the best interest of the authority and its plans

matter in question that makes reliance otherwise permitted by paragraph (c) of this subsection
unwarranted.
(e) Any action taken as a trustee, or any failure to take any action as a trustee, shall not be the basis for
monetary damages or injunctive relief unless:
1. The trustee has breached or failed to perform the duties of the trustee's office in compliance
with this section; and
