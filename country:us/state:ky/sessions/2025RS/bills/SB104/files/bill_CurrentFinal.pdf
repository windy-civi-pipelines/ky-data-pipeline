Page 6 of 9
SB010410.100 - 372 - XXXX 2/21/2025 9:58 AM GA

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS SB 104/GA
1 participant's actions in connection with the investment advice or financial planning
2 provided to the participant by operation of KRS 18A.245(7)(f) or other statute or
3 administrative regulation[otherwise]. The authority and board shall have no duty
4 or obligation to monitor, review, or assess the specific investment advice or
5 financial planning provided to a participant.
6 (4) (a) The participant shall have sole responsibility for evaluation, selection, and
7 monitoring of investments held in his or her self-directed brokerage
8 account, and shall at all times be and remain responsible and liable for any
9 losses in his or her self-directed brokerage account. Expenses charged for
10 use of a self-directed brokerage account shall be paid solely by the
11 participant.
12 (b) Neither the authority nor the board shall be liable for any losses, expenses,
13 liabilities, or claims due to a participant's actions in connection with a self-

2 2. On an informed basis; and
3 3. In a manner he or she honestly believes to be in the best interest of the
4 authority and its plans and trusts.
5 (b) A trustee discharges his or her duties on an informed basis if, when he or
6 she makes an inquiry into the business affairs of the board or authority or
7 into a particular action to be taken or decision to be made, he or she
8 exercises the care of an ordinary prudent person in a like position would
9 exercise under similar circumstances.
10 (c) In discharging his or her duties, a trustee may rely on information,
11 opinions, reports, or statements, including financial statements and other
12 financial data, if prepared or presented by:
13 1. One (1) or more officers or employees of the board whom the trustee
14 honestly believes to be reliable and competent in the matters
15 presented;
16 2. Legal counsel, public accountants, or other persons as to matters the

20 member if the trustee honestly believes the committee merits
21 confidence.
22 (d) A trustee shall not be considered as acting in good faith if he or she has
23 knowledge concerning the matter in question that makes reliance otherwise
24 permitted by paragraph (c) of this subsection unwarranted.
25 (e) Any action taken as a trustee, or any failure to take any action as a trustee,
26 shall not be the basis for monetary damages or injunctive relief unless:
27 1. The trustee has breached or failed to perform the duties of the
Page 8 of 9
SB010410.100 - 372 - XXXX 2/21/2025 9:58 AM GA

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS SB 104/GA
1 trustee's office in compliance with this section; and
2 2. In the case of an action for monetary damages, the breach or failure
3 to perform constitutes willful misconduct or wanton or reckless
4 disregard for human rights, safety, or property.
5 (f) A person bringing an action for monetary damages under this section shall
6 have the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence the provisions
7 of paragraph (e)1. and 2. of this subsection, and the burden of proving that
8 the breach or failure to perform was the legal cause of damages suffered by
9 the authority or its plans or trusts.
10 Section 5. KRS 18A.260 is amended to read as follows:
11 Assets held for the state public employees' deferred compensation trust fund shall be

13 participants in self-directed brokerage accounts shall be limited to securities registered
14 with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission only[In no case shall such
15 investment be other than permitted by KRS 18A.230 to 18A.275 and not prohibited by
16 Section 177 of the Kentucky Constitution and must be offered by such persons or
17 companies authorized and duly licensed by the State of Kentucky and applicable federal
18 regulatory agencies to offer such insurance or investment programs in compliance with
19 all relevant provisions of KRS 18A.230 to 18A.275].
