UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 36
2 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
3 ïƒ¢Section 1. KRS 76.090 is amended to read as follows:
4 (1) (a) The district may establish a schedule of rates, rentals, and charges, to be
5 collected from all the real property within the district area served by the
6 facilities of the district, and prescribe the manner in which and the time at
7 which the rates, rentals, and charges are to be paid.[, and] The district may
8 propose to change the schedule from time to time as the district deems
9 necessary, advisable, or expedient, but any proposed change to the rates,
10 rentals, or charges established by the district that in aggregate will generate
11 additional revenue in excess of the percent increase in the CPI between the
12 two (2) most recent calendar years available shall not go into effect until
13 approved by the legislative body of the city or the consolidated local
14 government containing the district.
15 (b) The schedule may be based upon either:
16 1.[(a)] The consumption of water on premises connected with the
17 facilities, taking into consideration commercial and industrial use of
18 water;[ or]
19 2.[(b)] The number and kind of plumbing fixtures connected with the
20 facilities;[ or]
21 3.[(c)] The number of persons served by the facilities;[ or]
22 4.[(d)] May be determined by the district on any other basis or
23 classification which the district determines to be fair and reasonable,
24 whether similar or dissimilar to those enumerated, except that the
25 schedule shall be uniform for all residential property; or
26 5.[(e)] Any combination thereof.
27 (c) This schedule may include additional charges for treatment of sewage, with a

1 surcharge where the sewage contains industrial wastes or other wastes in
2 excess of limitations established by regulations of the district.
3 (2) Prior to the final adoption or modification of the schedule for the district area, the
4 district shall adopt a proposed schedule and publish notice thereof pursuant to KRS
5 Chapter 424. The notice so published shall be dated as of the date of first
6 publication thereof and shall state that the proposed or revised schedule of rates,
7 rentals, and charges will remain open for inspection in the office of the district for
8 thirty (30) days from the date of the notice, and that objections thereto in writing
9 may be filed during that period with the district by any person aggrieved thereby.
10 The district shall examine and hear any and all complaints and[,] may modify the
11 proposed schedule. If the proposed schedule does not contain changes to rates,
12 rentals, or charges that would in aggregate generate additional revenue, the
13 district[, and] shall adopt and establish a final schedule within sixty (60) days after
14 the date of the notice. If the proposed schedule contains changes to rates, rentals,
15 or charges that would in aggregate generate additional revenue in excess of the
16 percent increase in the CPI between the two (2) most recent calendar years, the
17 district shall submit the proposed schedule to the legislative body of the city or the
18 consolidated local government containing the district for approval and shall not
19 adopt a final schedule until it has been approved by the legislative body.
20 Additionally,[;] the schedule[, however,] shall not become final within a county
21 outside a city of the first class until it has been approved by the fiscal court of the
22 county, or shall not become final within a city of the first class, unless and until it
23 has received the approval of the legislative body of the city of the first class by
24 ordinance approved by the mayor; provided, however, the schedule finally adopted
25 shall be sufficient and adequate to cover the purposes of this chapter. The schedules
26 shall be uniform for all property falling within the same classification, which
27 classification may be based upon the length of time the property has been in the

1 district area, the drainage area within which the property lies, or any similar or
2 dissimilar reasonable classification, except that the schedule shall be uniform for all
3 residential property. The schedule so adopted and established shall thereafter be the
4 rates, rentals, and charges for the use of the facilities of the district by users within
5 the district area, until changed in the manner[ herein] provided in this section. The
6 schedule of rates, rentals, and charges shall be established and may be revised from
7 time to time, subject to the requirements of subsection (1)(a) of this section, so as
8 to produce aggregate revenues to the district sufficient:
9 (a) For the payment of the interest on and principal of all revenue bonds and other
10 obligations of the district except construction subdistrict obligations and
11 bonds;
12 (b) For the payment of all cost and expenses of operating and maintaining the

14 not limited to that portion of the salaries, wages, and fees of all officers and
15 employees of the district equitably allocable to operations within or for the
16 district area; and
17 (c) For the payment of all cost of renewals and replacement of such system
18 within the district area; provided, however, that all expenses, salaries, wages,
19 and fees necessary or incident to improvements for the account of which
20 bonds are issued, may be included as a part of the cost of the improvements
21 and paid from the proceeds of the bonds.
22 The district may collect the sewer rates, rentals, and charges, or cause them to be
23 collected and paid to it by agencies it designates, and with whom it may make such
24 contracts or arrangements as the district deems proper. No moneys received on
25 account of the existence or operation of construction subdistricts shall be used for
26 the payment of district obligations, and no other moneys received by the district
27 shall be used for the payment of construction subdistrict bonds or obligations.
