1 authorization of an employee shall not be deemed to have violated this section
2 with respect to the employment of that employee.
3 (3) On a finding of a first violation by a court of competent jurisdiction that a
4 business entity or employer knowingly violated subsection (1) of this section, the
5 court shall do all of the following:
6 (a) Order the business entity or employer to terminate the employment of every
7 unauthorized alien;
8 (b) Subject the business entity or employer to a three (3) year probationary
9 period throughout the state. During the probationary period, the business

12 employer in the state;

14 the local county attorney within three (3) days after the order is issued by
15 the court stating that the business entity or employer has terminated the
16 employment of every unauthorized alien and the business entity or employer
17 will not knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien in this
18 state; and

25 employer shall submit to the court:
26 (a) A signed, sworn affidavit stating that the business entity or employer is in

8 consistent with the antidiscrimination laws of this state and the United States.

10 also have authority to bring a civil complaint in any court of competent
11 jurisdiction to enforce the requirements of this section.

23 complaint is not warranted.
24 (12) This section shall not apply to the relationship between a party and the employees
25 of an independent contractor performing work for the party and does not apply to
26 casual domestic labor performed within a household.

5 burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence the following:

7 officers or their agents rather than with the business entity or
8 employer;
9 2. The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and induced the
10 business entity or employer to commit the violation; and
11 3. The business entity or employer was not already predisposed to
12 commit the violation before the law enforcement officers or their
13 agents urged and induced the employer to commit the violation.
14 (14) In addition to actions taken by the state or political subdivisions thereof, the
15 Attorney General or the county attorney may bring an action to enforce the
16 requirements of this section in any District Court of a county in which the
17 business entity or employer does business.
18 (15) The terms of this section shall be interpreted consistently with 8 U.S.C. sec. 1324a

1 authorization of an employee shall not be deemed to have violated this section
2 with respect to the employment of that employee.
3 (3) On a finding of a first violation by a court of competent jurisdiction that a
4 business entity or employer knowingly violated subsection (1) of this section, the
5 court shall do all of the following:
6 (a) Order the business entity or employer to terminate the employment of every
7 unauthorized alien;
8 (b) Subject the business entity or employer to a three (3) year probationary
9 period throughout the state. During the probationary period, the business
10 entity or employer shall file quarterly reports with the local county attorney
11 specifying each new employee who is hired by the business entity or

20 suspend all existing business licenses and permits of the business entity or

24 (3)(d) of this section is reinstated, a legal representative of the business entity or
25 employer shall submit to the court:
26 (a) A signed, sworn affidavit stating that the business entity or employer is in

2 or employer at the time of enrollment in E-Verify.

7 section.
8 (6) For a second violation of subsection (1) of this section by a business entity or

5 section shall not be liable for any claims made against the business entity or

7 without regard to the race, ethnicity, or national origin of the employee and is
8 consistent with the antidiscrimination laws of this state and the United States.
9 (11) (a) In addition to the county attorneys of this state, the Attorney General shall
10 also have authority to bring a civil complaint in any court of competent
11 jurisdiction to enforce the requirements of this section.

13 enforcement action against a specific business entity or employer by means

19 (d) The Attorney General shall respond to any petition under this subsection

23 complaint is not warranted.
24 (12) This section shall not apply to the relationship between a party and the employees
25 of an independent contractor performing work for the party and does not apply to
26 casual domestic labor performed within a household.

3 testimony or other evidence the substantial elements of the violation.
4 (c) A business entity or employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the
5 burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence the following:

7 officers or their agents rather than with the business entity or
8 employer;
9 2. The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and induced the
10 business entity or employer to commit the violation; and
11 3. The business entity or employer was not already predisposed to
12 commit the violation before the law enforcement officers or their
13 agents urged and induced the employer to commit the violation.
14 (14) In addition to actions taken by the state or political subdivisions thereof, the
15 Attorney General or the county attorney may bring an action to enforce the
16 requirements of this section in any District Court of a county in which the
17 business entity or employer does business.
18 (15) The terms of this section shall be interpreted consistently with 8 U.S.C. sec. 1324a
