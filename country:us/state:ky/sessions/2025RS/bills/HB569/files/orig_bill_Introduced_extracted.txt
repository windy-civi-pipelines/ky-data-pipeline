3 substances or the prescribed substance or substances in amounts in excess of
4 prescribed amounts shall be the proximate cause of[caused] the injury,
5 occupational disease, or death of the employee and liability for compensation shall
6 not apply to the injury, occupational disease, or death to the employee.
7 (5) If injury or death results to an employee through the deliberate intention of his or
8 her employer to produce such injury or death, the employee or the employee's
9 dependent as herein defined shall receive the amount provided in this chapter in a
10 lump sum to be used, if desired, to prosecute the employer. The dependents may
11 bring suit against the employer for any amount they desire. If injury or death results
12 to an employee through the deliberate intention of his or her employer to produce
13 such injury or death, the employee or the employee's dependents may take under
14 this chapter, or in lieu thereof, have a cause of action at law against the employer as
15 if this chapter had not been passed, for such damage so sustained by the employee,
16 his or her dependents or personal representatives as is recoverable at law. If a suit is
17 brought under this subsection, all right to compensation under this chapter shall
18 thereby be waived as to all persons. If a claim is made for the payment of
19 compensation or any other benefit provided by this chapter, all rights to sue the
20 employer for damages on account of such injury or death shall be waived as to all
21 persons.
22 (6) Prior to issuing any building permit pursuant to KRS 198B.060(10), every local

24 builder before a permit is issued. A person who is exempt under the exception

26 chapter, shall so certify to the local building official, in writing and on a form
27 prescribed by the commissioner, in lieu of providing proof of workers'

5 and policy number, setting forth the means to access medical care for injuries, the
6 employee's obligation to give notice of accidents, and such other matters
7 concerning the employee's rights under this chapter as may be required by the
8 commissioner so as to afford every employee the opportunity to become informed
9 about the employer's workers' compensation program. The format and contents of
10 the notice shall be established by the commissioner through administrative
