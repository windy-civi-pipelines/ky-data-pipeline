Commonwealth as a result of the project, as well as economic activity that is diverted to the
project that formerly took place at existing establishments within the Commonwealth prior to the

estimated incremental revenues to determine the presence or absence of a positive fiscal impact;
and
9. A determination that the project will not occur if not for the designation of the development area,
