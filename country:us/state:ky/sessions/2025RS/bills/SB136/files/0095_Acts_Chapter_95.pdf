( SB 136 )
AN ACT relating to transportation and declaring an emergency.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
Section 1. KRS 186A.035 is amended to read as follows:
(1) (a) Except for vehicles described in paragraph (b) of this subsection, all motor vehicles, including
motorcycles, with a gross vehicular weight of ten thousand (10,000) pounds or less, first registered, or
for which the registration is renewed, shall be placed in a system of year-round registration based upon
the birth date of the owner, in order to distribute the work of registering motor vehicles as uniformly as
practicable throughout the twelve (12) months of the year.
(b) Owners of the following motor vehicles may elect to register these vehicles on an annual registration
schedule of April 1 to March 31:
1. Farm vehicles registered under KRS 186.050(4); or
2. Motor vehicles with a gross vehicular weight of ten thousand (10,000) pounds or less that are
owned by a business.
(2) (a) If the owner of a motor vehicle is other than an individual, the month in which the owning entity came
into being shall be used for purposes of this section.
(b) Except for motor vehicles jointly owned by spouses under paragraph (c) of this subsection, if a motor
vehicle is jointly owned:
1. One (1) of the owners, who is a resident of Kentucky, shall be identified as the designated owner;
2. The designated owner shall indicate to the county clerk his or her birth date to be used for
purposes of this section; and
3. If the circumstances of ownership change and the designated owner is no longer an owner of the
motor vehicle or no longer a resident of Kentucky, another owner may title the motor vehicle in
his or her name if that owner is a resident of Kentucky. If none of the remaining owners are a
resident of Kentucky, one (1) of the owners shall title the vehicle in that owner's state of
residence.
(c) If a motor vehicle is jointly owned by a married couple, the ownership shall exist as a joint tenancy with
right of survivorship, unless the registration expressly states to the contrary and gives an alternative
specific status. One (1) of the owners shall indicate to the county clerk his or her birth date to be used
for purposes of this section. Upon the death of one (1) of the spouses, the jointly-owned vehicle shall
transfer to the surviving spouse free from payment of any state-required transfer fees. The surviving
spouse shall include a copy of the death certificate with the application for a new title.
(d) A certificate of title:
1. May bear the connector "AND" to designate joint ownership. If the "AND" connector is used,
the signatures of all owners shall be required to transfer the certificate of title;
2. May bear the connector "OR" to designate joint ownership. If the "OR" connector is used,
the signature of only one (1) owner shall be required to transfer the certificate of title; and
3. Shall not bear the connector "AND/OR" to designate joint ownership. If a title produced prior
to the effective date of this Act bears the connector "AND/OR," the cabinet and the county
clerk shall follow the procedures in subparagraph 1. of this paragraph in transferring the
certificate of title, unless directed otherwise by a court.
(3) The certificate of registration and license plate issued for a motor vehicle first registered, renewed, or titled in
this state shall be valid until the expiration date on the registration receipt, unless revoked in accordance with
KRS 186A.040 or canceled by the cabinet in accordance with KRS Chapter 186 or this chapter. Any
transaction relating to registration or registration renewal which would cause an unexpired Kentucky motor

vehicle license plate to be surrendered shall have that unexpired fee prorated or credited against any additional
fee required by a subsequent registration.
(4) Except for vehicles registered under subsection (1)(b) of this section, KRS 186.041, 186.042, and 186.162 that
have a specified, universal expiration date, after a motor vehicle has been initially placed in the system of year-
round registration, the owner shall renew the registration annually during the owner's birth month, either by
making application to the county clerk or on the cabinet's website, and paying the fee required for twelve (12)
consecutive months of registration, which shall take effect on the first day of the month succeeding the owner's
birth month and shall expire on the last day of the owner's next birth month. The county clerk shall collect the
fees set forth in KRS 186.040(1) and (6) for each renewal.
(5) At least forty-five (45) days prior to the expiration of the registration of any motor vehicle previously
registered in the Commonwealth as provided by subsection (1) of this section, the owner of the vehicle shall be
notified by mail or email on the same notice required by KRS 134.805(5) of the date of expiration. Nonreceipt
of the notice required by this subsection shall not constitute a defense to any registration-related offense.
(6) Any owner who fails to renew the registration of a motor vehicle during the month in which the previous
registration expired shall, if he or she applies for renewal of the registration in some later month, pay the same
fees that would have been required if the registration had been renewed in the month which the previous
registration expired, and, if applicable, the reinstatement fee for a cancelled registration required under KRS
186.040.
(7) Fees which must be prorated in carrying out the intent of this section shall be prorated on the basis of twelfths
of the annual registration fee. Any vehicle which is registered at any time during a month shall pay the fee
required for that whole month plus any additional months of registration purchased consistent with the intent
of the section.
(8) The county clerk shall ensure that the certificate of registration issued to an owner displays the month and year
in which the registration period begins and the month and year of its expiration, and shall issue to the owner a
decal or decals corresponding to the month and year of expiration shown in the certificate of registration which
shall be placed upon the corresponding license plate by the owner in the manner required by administrative
regulations of the Department of Vehicle Regulation.

(3) When no in-state title exists, forms shall be designed by the department that require only the appropriate and
essential information to effect the application for title.

Existing statutory language in this chapter and KRS Chapter 186 pertaining to application, signature, forms, or
application transfer record may be construed to be electronic in nature at the discretion of the cabinet as
provided for by administrative regulation.
(6) Any person who knowingly enters, or attests to the entry of, false or erroneous information in pursuit of a

state under KRS 186A.530(5) and (6); and
2. Five (5) business days for all other salvage and rebuilt vehicles.
(2) Upon receiving an application packet from a county clerk, the[ application receipt clerk of the] Department of

four (4) working days following the day on which an application for a certificate of title is received by
it; and
(e) Compare the computer-produced certificate of title for consistency with the owner's application and

certificate of the title shall note that there are more than two (2) owners. The names of all title applicants shall
be documented in AVIS.
(8)[(9)] When the Department of Vehicle Regulation finds that a certificate of title should be issued for a
vehicle, the endorsement of the commissioner of the Department of Vehicle Regulation shall be engrossed
upon the certificate of title following a preprinted statement which shall read: I certify that the Department of
Vehicle Regulation has exercised due diligence in examining an application for a certificate of title for the

Section 6. KRS 186A.190 is amended to read as follows:
(1) Except as provided in subsection (6) of this section and in KRS 355.9-311(4), the perfection of a security
interest in any property for which has been issued a Kentucky certificate of title shall be by notation on the
certificate of title which shall be deemed to have occurred when the provisions of subsection (3) of this section
have been complied with. Discharge of a security interest shall be by notation on the certificate of title.
Notation shall be made by the entry of information required by subsection (9) of this section into the
Automated Vehicle Information System. The notation of the security interest on the certificate of title shall be
in accordance with this chapter and shall remain effective from the date on which the security interest is noted
on the certificate of title for a period of ten (10) years, or, in the case of a manufactured home, for a period of
thirty (30) years, or until discharged under this chapter and KRS Chapter 186. The filing of a continuation
statement within the six (6) months preceding the expiration of the initial period of a notation's effectiveness
extends the expiration date for five (5) additional years, commencing on the day the notation would have
expired in the absence of the filing. Succeeding continuation statements may be filed in the same manner to
continue the effectiveness of the initial notation.
(2) A motor vehicle dealer, a secured party or its representative, an assignee of a retail installment contract lender,
the cabinet, or a county clerk shall rely on a county of residence designated by the debtor on any approved,
notarized state form utilized in lien titling or the title transfer process signed by the debtor. Reliance on the
foregoing by the motor vehicle dealer, secured parties, cabinet, and county clerk shall relieve those persons
from liability to any third party claiming failure to comply with this section.
(3) Except as provided in subsection (6) of this section, the notation of security interests relating to property
required to be titled under this chapter in Kentucky through the cabinet shall be done in the office of a county
clerk. The notation of a security interest shall reflect the county in which the debtor resides as determined by
subsections (2) and (4) of this section. The security interest shall be deemed to be noted on the certificate of
title and perfected, or deemed perfected at the time the security interest attaches as provided in KRS 355.9-
203, if in compliance with KRS 186A.195(8)[(7)], when a title lien statement:
(a) Is received by the county clerk, together with the required fees;
(b) Describes the titled vehicle, or vehicle to be titled, by year, model, make, and vehicle identification
number;

CHAPTER 95 9
(c) Provides the name of the secured party, or a representative of the secured party, together with the
additional information about the secured party required by subsection (9) of this section with reasonable
particularity; and
(d) Includes the date and time-stamped entry of the notation of the security interest by the county clerk of
the required information in the Automated Vehicle Information System (AVIS), or its successor title
processing system maintained by the Division of Motor Vehicle Licensing of the Transportation
Cabinet.
(4) Except as provided in subsection (6) of this section, if the debtor is other than a natural person, the following
provisions govern the determination of the county of the debtor's residence:
(a) A partnership shall be deemed a resident of the county in which its principal place of business in this
state is located. If the debtor does not have a place of business in this state, then the debtor shall be
deemed a nonresident for purposes of filing in this state;
(b) A limited partnership organized under KRS Chapter 362 or as defined in KRS 362.2-102(14) shall be

registered or titled in Kentucky, the sole means of perfecting and discharging a security interest in property for
which a certificate of title is required by this chapter is by notation on the property's certificate of title under
the provisions of this chapter or in accordance with the provisions of KRS 186.045(3). In other respects the
security interest is governed by the provisions of KRS Chapter 355.
(5) Except as provided in subsection (6) of this section, before ownership of property subject to a lien evidenced
by notation on the certificate of title may be transferred, the transferor shall obtain the release of the prior liens
in his or her name against the property being transferred. Once a security interest has been noted on the
owner's title, a subsequent title shall not be issued by any county clerk free of the notation unless it has been
noted in the system of record established under KRS 186A.195 that the security interest has been discharged.
If this requirement is met, information relating to any security interest shown on the title as having been
discharged may be omitted from the title to be issued by the clerk. If information relating to the discharge of a
security interest is presented to a clerk under the provisions of KRS 186.045(3), the clerk shall discharge the
security interest and remove the lien information from AVIS.
(6) Notwithstanding subsections (1) to (5) of this section, a county clerk shall, following inspection of the vehicle
by the sheriff, to determine that the vehicle has not been stolen, issue a new ownership document to a vehicle,
clear of all prior liens, to a person after he or she provides to the county clerk an affidavit devised by the
Transportation Cabinet and completed by the person. The ownership document presented as a result of this
affidavit shall be in accordance with subsection (7) of this section. In the affidavit, the affiant shall attest that:
(a) The affiant or the agent of the affiant possesses the vehicle;
(b) Before he or she provided the notices required by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this subsection:
1. A debt on the vehicle has been owed him or her for more than thirty (30) days;
2. Within thirty (30) days of payment of damages by an insurance company and receipt by the
current owner of the motor vehicle or lienholder of damages pursuant to a claim settlement
which required transfer of the vehicle to the insurance company, the insurance company has been
unable to obtain:
a. A properly endorsed certificate of title on the vehicle from the current owner; and
b. If applicable, any lien satisfactions; or
3. a. The vehicle was voluntarily towed or transported pursuant to a request of the current
owner or an insurance company that a motor vehicle dealer, licensed as a used motor
vehicle dealer and motor vehicle auction dealer, take possession of and store the motor
vehicle in the regular course of business; and
b. Within forty-five (45) days of taking possession of the motor vehicle, the motor vehicle
dealer has not been paid storage fees by the current owner or lienholder and has not been
provided both a properly endorsed certificate of title and if applicable, any lien
satisfactions;
(c) More than thirty (30) days before presenting the affidavit to the county clerk, the affiant attempted to
notify the owner of the vehicle and all known lienholders, including those noted on the title, by certified
mail, return receipt requested, or by a nationally recognized courier service, of his or her name, address,
and telephone number as well as his or her intention to obtain a new title or salvage title, as applicable,
clear of all prior liens, unless the owner or a lienholder objects in writing;
(d) More than fourteen (14) days before presenting the affidavit to the county clerk, the affiant had
published a legal notice stating his or her intention to obtain title to the vehicle. The legal notice
appeared at least twice in a seven (7) day period in a newspaper with circulation in the county. The
legal notice stated:
1. The affiant's name, address, and telephone number;
2. The owner's name;
3. The names of all known lienholders, including those noted on the title;
4. The vehicle's make, model, and year; and
5. The affiant's intention to obtain title to the vehicle unless the owner or a lienholder objects in
writing within fourteen (14) days after the last publication of the legal notice; and

CHAPTER 95 11
(e) Neither the owner nor a lienholder has objected in writing to the affiant's right to obtain title to the
vehicle.
(7) (a) If subsection (6)(b)1. of this section applies, the new ownership document shall be a title.
(b) If subsection (6)(b)2. or 3. of this section applies, the new ownership document shall be a salvage title if
the vehicle meets the requirements for a salvage title as stated in KRS 186A.520(1)(a).
(c) If subsection (6)(b)2. or 3. of this section applies and the vehicle does not meet the requirements for a
salvage title as stated in KRS 186A.520(1)(a), the new ownership document shall be a title.
(8) No more than two (2) active security interests may be noted upon a certificate of title.
(9) In noting a security interest upon a certificate of title, the county clerk shall ensure that the certificate of title
bears the lienholder's name, mailing address and zip code, the date the lien was noted, the notation number,
and the county in which the security interest was noted. The clerk shall obtain the information required by this
subsection for notation upon the certificate of title from the title lien statement described in KRS 186A.195.

(12) (a) Any lien or security interest filed under this chapter may be electronically transmitted to the cabinet
through the electronic title application and registration system.
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, KRS 186A.015, and 186A.074 that require a lien to be
noted on the face of the title, if there are one (1) or more liens on a motor vehicle, the cabinet may
electronically notify the first lienholder of any additional liens.
(c) Subsequent lien satisfactions may be electronically transmitted to the cabinet and shall include the
name and address of the person satisfying the lien.
(d) When liens and lien satisfactions are electronically transmitted, a clean certificate of title shall not be
issued until the last lien is satisfied.
(e) A duly certified copy of the cabinet's electronic record of the lien shall be admissible in any civil,
criminal, or administrative proceedings in this state as evidence of the existence of the lien.
(13) If a security interest expires without being renewed, the cabinet shall remove the lien from the certificate of
title in the AVIS system.
Section 7. KRS 186A.195 is amended to read as follows:

security interest on the certificate of title in accordance with KRS 186A.190(9). Title lien statements may be
made available to the general public. However, public availability of a title lien statement shall not be
considered necessary or effective to perfect a security interest in property required to be registered or titled in
accordance with this chapter.
(4)[(3)] (a) If the submission of a title lien statement accompanies the application for first title of any
property in the name of an owner, the county clerk shall enter the information required by KRS
186A.190(9) into the system of record so as to allow the cabinet to:
1. Use the system of record as a centralized, statewide repository for lien filings; and
2. Produce a certificate of title bearing the information designated by KRS 186A.190(9), as well as

Legislative Research Commission PDF Version

12 ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY
(b) After the information has been entered, the county clerk shall produce a certificate of registration, if
required.
(5)[(4)] (a) If the form prescribed by KRS 186A.060 indicates a pending lien, but the title lien statement
does not accompany the application for title, the county clerk shall enter into the system of record the
name and address of the lienholder or that a lien is pending. The county clerk shall indicate a title shall
not be issued until either the title lien statement and the required fees are submitted, or in thirty (30)
days, whichever occurs first. The county clerk shall then issue the registration.
(b) After submission of the title lien statement, the county clerk shall enter the date of lien notation and the
notation number into the system of record, enabling the cabinet to record the lien in the system of
record and produce a title.
(6)[(5)] If a certificate of title is issued after the thirty (30) day time window identified in subsection (5)[(4)] of
this section has expired without the notation of a security interest, or if a title has been issued because there
was no provision made for a lien to be noted within thirty (30) days, a secured party wishing to note a security
interest on a title shall submit a title lien statement. The county clerk shall enter the information required by
KRS 186A.190(9) into the system of record and a new certificate of title reflecting the security interest shall be
produced.
(7)[(6)] The fee for the filing of a title lien statement through the electronic title application and registration
system shall be transferred electronically to the county clerk of the county in which the debtor resides.
(8)[(7)] The security interest noted on the certificate of title shall be deemed perfected at the time the security
interest attaches in accordance with KRS 355.9-203 if the secured party submits a properly completed title lien
statement with application for first title or, in the case of property previously titled in the name of the debtor,
within thirty (30) days of attachment. Otherwise, the security interest shall be deemed perfected at the time
that the title lien statement is submitted.

allow for additional dealer assignments without requiring system generated documents.
(5) (a) When a dealer assigns the vehicle to a purchaser for use, the dealer[he] shall deliver the properly
assigned certificate of title, and other documents if appropriate, to the[such] purchaser, who shall make

Legislative Research Commission PDF Version

16 ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY
(1) Except as provided in KRS 186A.555, a salvage title shall be obtained by the owner of a motor vehicle that
meets the following definition of a salvage vehicle:
(a) A vehicle which has been wrecked, destroyed, or damaged, to the extent that the total estimated or
actual cost of parts and labor to rebuild or reconstruct the vehicle to its preaccident condition and for
legal operation on the roads or highways, not including the cost of parts and labor to reinstall a
deployed airbag system, exceeds seventy-five percent (75%) of the retail value of the vehicle, as
prescribed by a nationally accepted used car valuation guide or tool identified under Section 12 of this
Act[by the Department of Revenue by administrative regulation].
(b) The value of repair parts for purposes of this definition shall be determined by using the current
published retail cost of the parts equal in kind and quality to the parts to be replaced or the actual retail
cost of the repair parts used in repair.
(c) The labor costs of repairs for purposes of this section shall be computed by using the hourly labor rate
and time allocations which are reasonable and customary in the automobile repair industry in the
community where the repairs are performed.
(d) Airbag reinstallation costs which are excluded from the seventy-five percent (75%) computation as set
forth in paragraph (a) of this subsection shall be included by an insurer in the computation of the total
physical damage estimate according to the terms and conditions of individual policies, provided that the
total costs payable by an insurer do not exceed the total retail value of the vehicle.
(2) The owner or an authorized agent of a motor vehicle that meets the definition of a salvage vehicle as set forth
in subsection (1) of this section shall, within fifteen (15) days from the receipt of all necessary paperwork
required by this chapter, submit an application to the county clerk, on a form prescribed by the Department of
Vehicle Regulation, for a salvage title, accompanied by a properly endorsed certificate of title and any lien
satisfactions, if any appear, as may be required.
(3) The county clerk shall retain a copy of each salvage title application received and shall forward the original
and its supporting documents to the Department of Vehicle Regulation in a manner similar to that for handling
of an application for a title.
(4) The county clerk shall rely on the information provided by the owner or authorized agent, including a county
of residence designation, on:
(a) Any approved, notarized state form utilized in lien titling or the title transfer process signed by the
owner or authorized agent; and
(b) Any document submitted during the transfer of a salvage vehicle from an owner to an insurer.
Reliance on the foregoing by the county clerk shall relieve the office of the county clerk from liability to any
third party claiming failure to comply with this section.
(5) The Department of Vehicle Regulation shall process the salvage title application in a manner similar to that
used in processing a title application and the salvage title shall be delivered in a like manner of a title. Salvage
titles shall be construed as proof of ownership of a vehicle in a state as to be unusable upon the highways of
the Commonwealth.
(6) A vehicle shall not be issued a registration for highway use as long as a salvage title is in force. The only time
a vehicle with a salvage title may be operated upon the highways of the Commonwealth is when it is in route
to or from an inspection by the certified inspector prior to obtaining a certificate of title after having been
rebuilt as per KRS 186.115.
(7) Notwithstanding the provisions of KRS 369.103, when a salvage vehicle is transferred from an owner to an

of any person other than a dealer to procure the buyer's acknowledgment signature on the vehicle transaction
record form shall render the sale voidable at the election of the buyer. The election to render the sale voidable
