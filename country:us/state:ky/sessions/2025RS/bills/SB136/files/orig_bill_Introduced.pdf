4 READ AS FOLLOWS:
5 (1) Upon receipt of a completed application for a motor vehicle title, the cabinet shall

7 only the electronic record of the title to be retained by the cabinet in AVIS with a
8 notation that no certificate of title has been printed on paper.
9 (2) The owner of a motor vehicle shall be considered to have obtained, and the
10 cabinet shall be considered to have issued, a certificate of title when a title record
11 has been created electronically as provided in this section.
12 (3) An owner listed on a title record created under this section may, at any time,
13 make application for a physical copy of the title using the procedures in this
14 chapter, and the cabinet shall provide a paper certificate of title for the vehicle. A
15 fee shall not be charged for the first paper copy of a title requested for a vehicle
16 for which the title is stored electronically under this section.

19 vehicles, including motorcycles, with a gross vehicular weight of ten thousand
20 (10,000) pounds or less, first registered, or for which the registration is
21 renewed, shall be placed in a system of year-round registration based upon the
22 birth date of the owner, in order to distribute the work of registering motor
23 vehicles as uniformly as practicable throughout the twelve (12) months of the
24 year.
25 (b) Owners of the following motor vehicles may elect to register these vehicles on
26 an annual registration schedule of April 1 to March 31:

1 2. Motor vehicles with a gross vehicular weight of ten thousand (10,000)
2 pounds or less that are owned by a business.
3 (2) (a) If the owner of a motor vehicle is other than an individual, the month in which
4 the owning entity came into being shall be used for purposes of this section.
5 (b) Except for motor vehicles jointly owned by spouses under paragraph (c) of
6 this subsection, if a motor vehicle is jointly owned:
7 1. One (1) of the owners, who is a resident of Kentucky, shall be identified
8 as the designated owner;
9 2. The designated owner shall indicate to the county clerk his or her birth
10 date to be used for purposes of this section; and
11 3. If the circumstances of ownership change and the designated owner is
12 no longer an owner of the motor vehicle or no longer a resident of
13 Kentucky, another owner may title the motor vehicle in his or her name
14 if that owner is a resident of Kentucky. If none of the remaining owners
15 are a resident of Kentucky, one (1) of the owners shall title the vehicle
16 in that owner's state of residence.
17 (c) If a motor vehicle is jointly owned by a married couple, the ownership shall
18 exist as a joint tenancy with right of survivorship, unless the registration
19 expressly states to the contrary and gives an alternative specific status. One
20 (1) of the owners shall indicate to the county clerk his or her birth date to be
21 used for purposes of this section. Upon the death of one (1) of the spouses, the
22 jointly-owned vehicle shall transfer to the surviving spouse free from payment
23 of any state-required transfer fees. The surviving spouse shall include a copy
24 of the death certificate with the application for a new title.

3 "OR" connector is used, the signature of only one (1) owner shall be
4 required to transfer the certificate of title; and
5 3. Shall not bear the connector "AND/OR" to designate joint ownership.
6 If a title produced prior to the effective date of this Act bears the

8 the procedures in subparagraph 1. of this paragraph in transferring
9 the certificate of title, unless directed otherwise by a court.
10 (3) The certificate of registration and license plate issued for a motor vehicle first
11 registered, renewed, or titled in this state shall be valid until the expiration date on
12 the registration receipt, unless revoked in accordance with KRS 186A.040 or
13 canceled by the cabinet in accordance with KRS Chapter 186 or this chapter. Any
14 transaction relating to registration or registration renewal which would cause an
15 unexpired Kentucky motor vehicle license plate to be surrendered shall have that
16 unexpired fee prorated or credited against any additional fee required by a
17 subsequent registration.
18 (4) Except for vehicles registered under subsection (1)(b) of this section, KRS 186.041,
19 186.042, and 186.162 that have a specified, universal expiration date, after a motor
20 vehicle has been initially placed in the system of year-round registration, the owner
21 shall renew the registration annually during the owner's birth month, either by
22 making application to the county clerk or on the cabinet's website, and paying the
23 fee required for twelve (12) consecutive months of registration, which shall take
24 effect on the first day of the month succeeding the owner's birth month and shall
25 expire on the last day of the owner's next birth month. The county clerk shall collect
26 the fees set forth in KRS 186.040(1) and (6) for each renewal.

1 vehicle previously registered in the Commonwealth as provided by subsection (1)
2 of this section, the owner of the vehicle shall be notified by mail or email on the
3 same notice required by KRS 134.805(5) of the date of expiration. Nonreceipt of
4 the notice required by this subsection shall not constitute a defense to any
5 registration-related offense.
6 (6) Any owner who fails to renew the registration of a motor vehicle during the month
7 in which the previous registration expired shall, if he or she applies for renewal of
8 the registration in some later month, pay the same fees that would have been
9 required if the registration had been renewed in the month which the previous
10 registration expired, and, if applicable, the reinstatement fee for a cancelled
11 registration required under KRS 186.040.
12 (7) Fees which must be prorated in carrying out the intent of this section shall be
13 prorated on the basis of twelfths of the annual registration fee. Any vehicle which is
14 registered at any time during a month shall pay the fee required for that whole
15 month plus any additional months of registration purchased consistent with the
16 intent of the section.
17 (8) The county clerk shall ensure that the certificate of registration issued to an owner
18 displays the month and year in which the registration period begins and the month
19 and year of its expiration, and shall issue to the owner a decal or decals
20 corresponding to the month and year of expiration shown in the certificate of
21 registration which shall be placed upon the corresponding license plate by the
22 owner in the manner required by administrative regulations of the Department of
23 Vehicle Regulation.

14 perfection of a security interest in any property for which has been issued a
15 Kentucky certificate of title shall be by notation on the certificate of title which
16 shall be deemed to have occurred when the provisions of subsection (3) of this
17 section have been complied with. Discharge of a security interest shall be by
18 notation on the certificate of title. Notation shall be made by the entry of
19 information required by subsection (9) of this section into the Automated Vehicle
20 Information System. The notation of the security interest on the certificate of title
21 shall be in accordance with this chapter and shall remain effective from the date on
22 which the security interest is noted on the certificate of title for a period of ten (10)
23 years, or, in the case of a manufactured home, for a period of thirty (30) years, or
24 until discharged under this chapter and KRS Chapter 186. The filing of a

7 foregoing by the motor vehicle dealer, secured parties, cabinet, and county clerk
8 shall relieve those persons from liability to any third party claiming failure to

10 (3) Except as provided in subsection (6) of this section, the notation of security
11 interests relating to property required to be titled under this chapter in Kentucky
12 through the cabinet shall be done in the office of a county clerk. The notation of a
13 security interest shall reflect the county in which the debtor resides as determined
14 by subsections (2) and (4) of this section. The security interest shall be deemed to
15 be noted on the certificate of title and perfected, or deemed perfected at the time the
16 security interest attaches as provided in KRS 355.9-203, if in compliance with KRS
17 186A.195 (8)[(7)], when a title lien statement:

7 financing statement under the provisions of KRS Chapter 355 relating to any
