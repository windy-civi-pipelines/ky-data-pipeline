5 vehicles, including motorcycles, with a gross vehicular weight of ten thousand
6 (10,000) pounds or less, first registered, or for which the registration is
7 renewed, shall be placed in a system of year-round registration based upon the
8 birth date of the owner, in order to distribute the work of registering motor
9 vehicles as uniformly as practicable throughout the twelve (12) months of the
10 year.
11 (b) Owners of the following motor vehicles may elect to register these vehicles on
12 an annual registration schedule of April 1 to March 31:

1 are a resident of Kentucky, one (1) of the owners shall title the vehicle
2 in that owner's state of residence.
3 (c) If a motor vehicle is jointly owned by a married couple, the ownership shall
4 exist as a joint tenancy with right of survivorship, unless the registration
5 expressly states to the contrary and gives an alternative specific status. One
6 (1) of the owners shall indicate to the county clerk his or her birth date to be
7 used for purposes of this section. Upon the death of one (1) of the spouses, the

13 "AND" connector is used, the signatures of all owners shall be
14 required to transfer the certificate of title;

25 the registration receipt, unless revoked in accordance with KRS 186A.040 or
26 canceled by the cabinet in accordance with KRS Chapter 186 or this chapter. Any

4 (4) Except for vehicles registered under subsection (1)(b) of this section, KRS 186.041,
5 186.042, and 186.162 that have a specified, universal expiration date, after a motor

16 same notice required by KRS 134.805(5) of the date of expiration. Nonreceipt of
17 the notice required by this subsection shall not constitute a defense to any
18 registration-related offense.
19 (6) Any owner who fails to renew the registration of a motor vehicle during the month
20 in which the previous registration expired shall, if he or she applies for renewal of
21 the registration in some later month, pay the same fees that would have been
22 required if the registration had been renewed in the month which the previous
23 registration expired, and, if applicable, the reinstatement fee for a cancelled
24 registration required under KRS 186.040.
25 (7) Fees which must be prorated in carrying out the intent of this section shall be
26 prorated on the basis of twelfths of the annual registration fee. Any vehicle which is
