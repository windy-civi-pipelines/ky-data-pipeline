19 protection, and for other public services and facilities;

8 (a) That it is the policy of this Commonwealth to protect and promote the health,

11 and abandoned[deteriorated] properties within these neighborhoods;
12 (b) That the elimination of such blight and deterioration and the preparation of the

Page 16 of 18

1 the public use after the petitioner takes ownership of the property;
2 3. Petitioner has access to funding to complete the public use; and
3 4. Public use cannot be accomplished by using or acquiring other

13 substance:
14 1.[(a)] A finding that the report of the commissioners conforms to the
15 provisions of KRS 416.580;
16 2.[(b)] A finding that the petitioner is not authorized to condemn the

19 petition, stating the particular ground or grounds on which the petitioner
20 is not so authorized;
21 and
22 3.[(c)] An order dismissing the petition and directing the petitioner to pay
23 all costs.
24 Section 16. KRS 416.675 is amended to read as follows:

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1034
1 (2) "Public use" means[shall mean the following]:
2 (a) [Ownership of the property by the Commonwealth, a political subdivision of
3 the Commonwealth, or other governmental entity;
4 (b)] The possession, occupation, or enjoyment of the property by the general
5 public or[as a matter of right] by the Commonwealth, a political subdivision
6 of the Commonwealth, or other governmental entity;
7 (b)[(c)] The acquisition and transfer of blighted or abandoned property [for the
8 purpose of eliminating blighted areas, slum areas, or substandard and
9 insanitary areas ]in accordance with KRS Chapter 99; or
10 (c)[(d)] The use of the property for the [creation or ]operation of public utilities
11 that serve the general public[or common carriers; or
12 (e) Other use of the property expressly authorized by statute].
13 (3) No provision in the law of the Commonwealth shall be construed to authorize the
14 condemnation of private property for transfer to a private owner for the purpose of
15 economic development that benefits the general public only indirectly, such as by
16 increasing the tax base, tax revenues, or employment, or by promoting the general
17 economic health of the community.[ However, this provision shall not prohibit the
18 sale or lease of property to private entities that occupy an incidental area within a
19 public project or building, provided that no property may be condemned primarily
20 for the purpose of facilitating an incidental private use.]
21 (4) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a taking of private property
22 for a public use because the public use provides ancillary economic benefits[The
23 exercise of the power of eminent domain for the acquisition of property financed by
24 state road funds or federal highway funds shall be exempt from the provisions of
25 this section].

1 Section 6. KRS 99.700 is amended to read as follows:
2 (1) It is hereby found:
3 (a) That there exist within the jurisdiction of many local governments in this
4 Commonwealth blighted and abandoned[deteriorated] properties in
5 neighborhoods which cause the deterioration of those and contiguous
6 neighborhoods and constitute a serious and growing menace which is
7 injurious to the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the
8 residents of the Commonwealth, and are beyond remedy and control solely by
9 regulatory process in the exercise of the police power;
10 (b) That the existence of blighted and abandoned[deteriorated] properties within
11 neighborhoods, and the growth and spread of blight and deterioration or the
12 threatened deterioration of other neighborhoods and properties:
13 1. Contribute substantially and increasingly to the spread of disease and
14 crime, and to losses by fire and accident;
15 2. Necessitate expensive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds
16 for the preservation of the public health and safety, for crime prevention,
17 correction, prosecution, and punishment, for the treatment of juvenile
18 delinquency, for the maintenance of adequate police, fire and accident
19 protection, and for other public services and facilities;
20 3. Constitute an economic and social liability;
21 4. Substantially impair or arrest the sound growth of the community;
22 5. Retard the provision of decent, safe, and sanitary housing
23 accommodations;
24 6. Depreciate assessable values;
25 7. Cause an abnormal exodus of families from these neighborhoods; and

27 residents of these neighborhoods;

XXXX 1/9/2025 5:00 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1034
1 (c) That this menace cannot be effectively dealt with by private enterprise
2 without the aids provided herein; and
3 (d) That the benefits which would result from eliminating the blighted or
4 abandoned properties that cause the blight and deterioration of neighborhoods
5 will accrue to the inhabitants of the neighborhoods in which these conditions
6 exist and to the inhabitants of this Commonwealth generally.
7 (2) It is hereby declared:
8 (a) That it is the policy of this Commonwealth to protect and promote the health,
9 safety, and welfare of the people of the Commonwealth by eliminating the
10 blight and deterioration of neighborhoods through the elimination of blighted
11 and abandoned[deteriorated] properties within these neighborhoods;
12 (b) That the elimination of such blight and deterioration and the preparation of the
13 properties for sale or lease, for development or redevelopment, constitute a
14 public use and purpose for which public money may be expended and private
15 property acquired and are governmental functions in the interest of the health,
16 safety, and welfare of the people of the Commonwealth; and
17 (c) That the necessity in the public interest for the provisions enacted herein is
18 hereby declared to be a legislative determination.
19 Section 7. KRS 99.705 is amended to read as follows:

14 independent appraiser, general building or residential contractor or inspector;
15 or
16 (b) The cost of demolition of the property, if the commissioners determine that

3 416.550 to 416.670 and other applicable law to condemn the property or the
4 use and occupation of the property[thereof];

12 extent condemned, as adjudged therein in the event no exception is taken as
13 provided in KRS 416.620(1).
14 (3) Any exception from the[such] interlocutory judgment by either party or both parties

Page 16 of 18

2 3. Petitioner has access to funding to complete the public use; and
3 4. Public use cannot be accomplished by using or acquiring other
4 property with the consent of the owner of the other property without
5 an unreasonable delay or increase in cost.

7 property or the use and occupation of the property sought to be
8 condemned[such rights], an interlocutory judgment, as provided for in
9 subsection (2) of this section, shall be entered.
10 (d) If the court determines that petitioner does not have the[such] right to
11 condemn the property or the use and occupation of the property sought to
12 be condemned, it shall enter a final judgment which shall contain, in
13 substance:
14 1.[(a)] A finding that the report of the commissioners conforms to the
15 provisions of KRS 416.580;
16 2.[(b)] A finding that the petitioner is not authorized to condemn the
17 property or the use and occupation of the property[thereof] for the
18 purposes and under the conditions and limitations set forth in the
19 petition, stating the particular ground or grounds on which the petitioner
20 is not so authorized;
21 and
22 3.[(c)] An order dismissing the petition and directing the petitioner to pay
23 all costs.

8 purpose of eliminating blighted areas, slum areas, or substandard and

11 that serve the general public[or common carriers; or
12 (e) Other use of the property expressly authorized by statute].
13 (3) No provision in the law of the Commonwealth shall be construed to authorize the
14 condemnation of private property for transfer to a private owner for the purpose of
15 economic development that benefits the general public only indirectly, such as by
16 increasing the tax base, tax revenues, or employment, or by promoting the general
17 economic health of the community.[ However, this provision shall not prohibit the
18 sale or lease of property to private entities that occupy an incidental area within a
19 public project or building, provided that no property may be condemned primarily
20 for the purpose of facilitating an incidental private use.]
21 (4) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a taking of private property
22 for a public use because the public use provides ancillary economic benefits[The
23 exercise of the power of eminent domain for the acquisition of property financed by
24 state road funds or federal highway funds shall be exempt from the provisions of
