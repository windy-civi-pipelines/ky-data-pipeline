14 (1) (a) An eligible local government shall be entitled to receive an annual supplement
15 of three thousand dollars ($3,000) and, beginning July 1, 2018, an annual
16 supplement of four thousand dollars ($4,000) for each qualified professional

21 (b) The employer's contribution to any of these plans on the supplement shall not

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1242

2 contribution on the supplement.
3 (d) Should the foundation program funds be insufficient to pay employer
4 contributions to the system, then the total amount available for pension
5 payments shall be prorated to each eligible government so that each receives
6 the same percentage of required pension costs attributable to the supplement.
7 (e) 1. In addition to the payments received under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this
8 subsection, but only if sufficient funds are available to fully reimburse
9 each eligible local government for the employer contributions to the
10 pension system, each local government shall receive an administrative
11 expense reimbursement in an amount equal to seven and sixty-five one-
12 hundredths percent (7.65%) of the total annual supplement received
13 greater than three thousand one hundred dollars ($3,100) for each
14 qualified professional firefighter it employs, subject to the cap
15 established by subparagraph 3. of this paragraph.
16 2. The local government may use the moneys received under this
17 paragraph in any manner it deems necessary to partially cover the costs
18 of administering the payments received under paragraph (a) of this
19 subsection.
20 3. The total amount distributed under this paragraph shall not exceed the
21 total sum of two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) for each
22 fiscal year. If there are insufficient funds to provide for full
23 reimbursement as provided in subparagraph 1. of this paragraph, then
24 the amount shall be distributed pro rata to each eligible local
25 government so that each receives the same percentage attributable to its
26 total receipt of the cash salary supplement.

Page 8 of 10
XXXX 1/14/2025 10:07 AM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1242
1 supplement pursuant to subsection (1)(a) of this section due to employment of
2 the firefighter, shall receive distribution of the supplement from that local
3 government in twelve (12) equal monthly installments with his or her pay for
4 the last pay period of each month. The monthly distribution shall be
5 calculated by dividing the supplement amount established in subsection (1)(a)
6 of this section by twelve (12).

8 this section shall not be considered "wages" as defined by KRS
9 337.010(1)(f)[(c)]1. and shall not be included in the hourly wage rate for
10 calculation of overtime pursuant to KRS 337.285 for scheduled overtime. The
11 supplement shall be included in the hourly wage rates for calculation of
12 overtime for unscheduled overtime pursuant to KRS 337.285.
13 (c) To determine the addition to the hourly wage rate for calculation of overtime
14 on unscheduled overtime, the annual supplement shall be divided by two
15 thousand eighty (2,080). The overtime rate for unscheduled overtime shall be
16 calculated by adding the quotient, which is the amount of the annual
17 supplement divided by two thousand eighty (2,080), to the hourly wage rate
18 and multiplying the total by one and one-half (1.5). The enhanced overtime
19 rate shall be paid only for unscheduled overtime. Scheduled overtime shall be
20 paid at one and one-half (1.5) times the regular hourly wage rate, excluding
21 the supplement.
22 (3) (a) The Kentucky Community and Technical College System shall be entitled to
23 receive annually a supplement equal to the amount determined in subsection
24 (1) of this section for each Kentucky fire and rescue training coordinator
25 employed by the Kentucky Community and Technical College System who
26 meets the qualifications for individual firefighters required in KRS 95A.230,
27 plus an amount equal to the required employer's contribution on the
Page 9 of 10

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1242
1 supplement to the defined benefit pension plan.
2 (b) The Department of Military Affairs shall be entitled to receive annually a
3 supplement equal to the amount determined in subsection (1) of this section
4 for each civilian firefighter employed by the Department of Military Affairs
5 who meets the qualifications for individual firefighters required in KRS
6 95A.230, plus an amount equal to the required employer's contribution on the
7 supplement to the defined benefit pension plan.
8 (c) Each fire and rescue training coordinator employed by the Kentucky
9 Community and Technical College System and each civilian firefighter
10 employed by the Department of Military Affairs, whose employer receives a
11 supplement pursuant to this subsection, shall receive distribution from that
12 employer of the supplement which his or her qualifications brought to the
13 employer. The supplement distributed shall be in addition to his or her regular
14 salary.
15 Section 4. KRS 337.020 is amended to read as follows:
16 Every employer doing business in this state shall, as often as semimonthly, pay to each of
17 its employees all wages or salary earned to a day not more than eighteen (18) days prior
18 to the date of that payment. Any employee who is absent at the time fixed for payment, or
19 who, for any other reason, is not paid at that time, shall be paid thereafter at any time
20 upon six (6) days' demand. No employer subject to this section shall, by any means,
21 secure exemption from it. Every such employee shall have a right of action against any
22 such employer for the full amount of his or her wages due on each regular pay day. The
23 provisions of this section do not apply to those individuals defined in KRS
24 337.010(2)(b)[(a)]2.

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1242

4 contributions to the system, then the total amount available for pension
5 payments shall be prorated to each eligible government so that each receives
6 the same percentage of required pension costs attributable to the supplement.
7 (e) 1. In addition to the payments received under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this

9 each eligible local government for the employer contributions to the
10 pension system, each local government shall receive an administrative

19 subsection.
20 3. The total amount distributed under this paragraph shall not exceed the

2 the firefighter, shall receive distribution of the supplement from that local
3 government in twelve (12) equal monthly installments with his or her pay for

8 this section shall not be considered "wages" as defined by KRS
9 337.010(1)(f)[(c)]1. and shall not be included in the hourly wage rate for
10 calculation of overtime pursuant to KRS 337.285 for scheduled overtime. The
11 supplement shall be included in the hourly wage rates for calculation of
12 overtime for unscheduled overtime pursuant to KRS 337.285.
13 (c) To determine the addition to the hourly wage rate for calculation of overtime
14 on unscheduled overtime, the annual supplement shall be divided by two
15 thousand eighty (2,080). The overtime rate for unscheduled overtime shall be
16 calculated by adding the quotient, which is the amount of the annual
17 supplement divided by two thousand eighty (2,080), to the hourly wage rate
18 and multiplying the total by one and one-half (1.5). The enhanced overtime
19 rate shall be paid only for unscheduled overtime. Scheduled overtime shall be

21 the supplement.

23 receive annually a supplement equal to the amount determined in subsection
24 (1) of this section for each Kentucky fire and rescue training coordinator

1 supplement to the defined benefit pension plan.
2 (b) The Department of Military Affairs shall be entitled to receive annually a
3 supplement equal to the amount determined in subsection (1) of this section
4 for each civilian firefighter employed by the Department of Military Affairs
5 who meets the qualifications for individual firefighters required in KRS
6 95A.230, plus an amount equal to the required employer's contribution on the
7 supplement to the defined benefit pension plan.
8 (c) Each fire and rescue training coordinator employed by the Kentucky
9 Community and Technical College System and each civilian firefighter
10 employed by the Department of Military Affairs, whose employer receives a
11 supplement pursuant to this subsection, shall receive distribution from that
12 employer of the supplement which his or her qualifications brought to the
13 employer. The supplement distributed shall be in addition to his or her regular
14 salary.
15 Section 4. KRS 337.020 is amended to read as follows:
16 Every employer doing business in this state shall, as often as semimonthly, pay to each of
17 its employees all wages or salary earned to a day not more than eighteen (18) days prior
18 to the date of that payment. Any employee who is absent at the time fixed for payment, or
19 who, for any other reason, is not paid at that time, shall be paid thereafter at any time
20 upon six (6) days' demand. No employer subject to this section shall, by any means,
21 secure exemption from it. Every such employee shall have a right of action against any
22 such employer for the full amount of his or her wages due on each regular pay day. The
23 provisions of this section do not apply to those individuals defined in KRS
24 337.010(2)(b)[(a)]2.
