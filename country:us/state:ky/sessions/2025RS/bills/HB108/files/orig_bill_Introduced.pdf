UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 214
1 shall be reduced to compensate for any increase in the aggregate assessed value of
2 real property to the extent that the increase exceeds the preceding year's assessment
3 by more than four percent (4%), excluding:
4 (a) The assessment of new property as defined in KRS 132.010(8);
5 (b) The assessment from property which is subject to tax increment financing
6 pursuant to KRS Chapter 65; and
7 (c) The assessment from leasehold property which is owned and financed by a
8 tax-exempt governmental unit, or tax-exempt statutory authority under the
9 provisions of KRS Chapter 103 and entitled to the reduced rate of one and
10 one-half cents ($0.015) pursuant to subsection (1)(f) of this section. In any

21 determined to be acceptable by the department, or when the number of counties
22 having at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the total real property assessment for
23 the previous year have been determined to be acceptable by the department, make
24 an estimate of the real property assessments of the uncertified counties and compute
25 the state tax rate.
26 (4) If the tax rate set by the department as provided in subsection (2) of this section
27 produces more than a four percent (4%) increase in real property tax revenues,

4 pursuant to KRS Chapter 65; and

6 exempt governmental unit, or tax-exempt statutory authority under the
7 provisions of KRS Chapter 103 and entitled to the reduced rate of one and
8 one-half cents ($0.015) pursuant to subsection (1) of this section;
9 the rate shall be adjusted in the succeeding year so that the cumulative total of each
10 year's property tax revenue increase shall not exceed four percent (4%) per year.
11 (5) The provisions of subsection (2) of this section notwithstanding, the assessed value
12 of unmined coal certified by the department after July 1, 1994, shall not be included
13 with the assessed value of other real property in determining the state real property
14 tax rate. All omitted unmined coal assessments made after July 1, 1994, shall also
15 be excluded from the provisions of subsection (2) of this section. The calculated
16 rate shall, however, be applied to unmined coal property, and the state revenue shall
17 be devoted to the program described in KRS 146.550 to 146.570, except that four
18 hundred thousand dollars ($400,000) of the state revenue shall be paid annually to
19 the State Treasury and credited to the Office of Energy Policy for the purpose of
20 public education of coal-related issues.
