13 certificate of delinquency met the requirements for inclusion on the
14 protected list pursuant to KRS 134.504(10) and it:
15 a. Was included on the protected list;
16 b. Was mistakenly left off the protected list; or
17 c. Became eligible for inclusion on the protected list between the

23 refund is sought.
24 (c) 1. Upon acceptance and approval of the application for refund, the county
25 clerk shall approve a refund of the amount paid to the county clerk by

3 amounts in the hands of the county clerk due to the state, county, taxing
4 districts, sheriff, county attorney, and the county clerk on a pro rata
5 basis, if the county clerk has sufficient funds in his or her hands to make
6 the refund.
7 3. If the county clerk does not have sufficient funds to make the refund at
8 the time the refund is approved, the county clerk may either:
9 a. Retain the approved refund claim in his or her office and make the

11 her hands to make the refund payment; or
12 b. Provide a signed letter to the person to whom payment is due,
13 which includes the amount due from each taxing jurisdiction or fee
14 office, and which directs each taxing jurisdiction or fee official to
15 pay to the person the amount due and owing from that taxing
16 jurisdiction or fee official as reflected in the letter.
17 4. Upon the making of a refund to a third-party purchaser, the county clerk
18 shall issue and file a release of the lien on the property assessed for taxes
19 as provided in this subparagraph without charge to the third-party
20 purchaser. The release shall be linked to the encumbrance in the county

5 b. The release form shall be signed by the government official
6 responsible for making the correction.
7 c. In addition to the signed release form, information filed by the
8 county clerk shall include a copy of the documentation provided
9 by the government official and a copy of the refund check or letter
10 of refund authorization issued to the third-party purchaser. The
11 county clerk shall record and file this information without a fee.
12 d. The county clerk shall also make any necessary corrections to the
13 tax records within the office of the county clerk.
14 e. The county clerk shall return the release document to the taxpayer
15 and shall provide a copy of the release document to the third-party

19 of law, the third-party purchaser may appeal the decision of the county clerk
20 or the property valuation administrator to the Kentucky Tax Tribunal[Board
21 of Tax Appeals] pursuant to Section 7 of this Act[KRS 49.220].

1 the applicable statute without reference to the constitutionality of the statute.
2 (2) When money has been paid into the State Treasury in payment of any state taxes,
3 except ad valorem taxes, whether payment was made voluntarily or involuntarily,
4 the appropriate agency shall authorize refunds to the person who paid the tax, or to
5 his or her heirs, personal representatives or assigns, of any overpayment of tax and
6 any payment where no tax was due. When a bona fide controversy exists between
7 the agency and the taxpayer as to the liability of the taxpayer for the payment of tax
8 claimed to be due by the agency, the taxpayer may pay the amount claimed by the
9 agency to be due, and if an appeal is taken by the taxpayer from the ruling of the
10 agency within the time provided by Section 7 of this Act[KRS 49.220] and it is
11 finally adjudged that the taxpayer was not liable for the payment of the tax or any
12 part thereof, the agency shall authorize the refund or credit as the Kentucky Tax
13 Tribunal[Board of Tax Appeals] or courts may direct.
14 (3) No refund shall be made unless each taxpayer individually files an application or
15 claim for the refund within four (4) years from the date payment was made. Each
16 claim or application for a refund shall be in writing and state the specific grounds
17 upon which it is based. Denials of refund claims or applications may be protested
18 and appealed in accordance with Section 7 of this Act[KRS 49.220] and 131.110.
19 (4) Notwithstanding any provision of this section, when an assessment of limited
20 liability entity tax is made under KRS 141.0401 against a pass-through entity as
21 defined in KRS 141.206, the corporation or individual partners, members, or
22 shareholders of the pass-through entity shall have the greater of the time period
23 provided by this section or one hundred eighty (180) days from the date the
24 assessment becomes final to file amended returns requesting any refund of tax for
25 the taxable year of the assessment and to allow for items of income, deduction, and
26 credit to be properly reported on the returns of the partners, members, or
27 shareholders of the pass-through entity subject to adjustment.

1 (5) Refunds shall be authorized with interest as provided in KRS 131.183. The refunds
2 authorized by this section shall be made in the same manner as other claims on the
3 State Treasury are paid. They shall not be charged against any appropriation, but
4 shall be deducted from tax receipts for the current fiscal year.
5 (6) Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the agency to make or cause
6 to be made any refund except within four (4) years of the date prescribed by law for
7 the filing of a return including any extension of time for filing the return, or the date
8 the money was paid into the State Treasury, whichever is the later, except in any
9 case where the assessment period has been extended by written agreement between
10 the taxpayer and the department, the limitation contained in this subsection shall be
11 extended accordingly. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring the
12 agency to authorize any refund to a taxpayer without demand from the taxpayer, if
13 in the opinion of the agency the cost to the state of authorizing the refund would be
14 greater than the amount that should be refunded or credited.
15 (7) This section shall not apply to any case in which the statute may be held
16 unconstitutional, either in whole or in part.
17 (8) In cases in which a statute has been held unconstitutional, taxes paid thereunder
18 may be refunded to the extent provided by KRS 134.590, and by the statute held
19 unconstitutional.
20 (9) No person shall secure a refund of motor fuels tax under KRS 134.580 unless the
21 person holds an unrevoked refund permit issued by the department before the
22 purchase of gasoline or special fuels and that permit entitles the person to apply for
23 a refund under KRS 138.344 to 138.355.

24 appropriation or mandated appropriation for the payment of any claim for
25 recovery, refund, or credit of any tax overpayment for any taxable year ending

10 state on the land.
11 (2) No state government agency shall authorize a refund unless each taxpayer
12 individually applies for a refund within two (2) years from the date the taxpayer
13 paid the tax. Each claim or application for a refund shall be in writing and state the
14 specific grounds upon which it is based. Denials of refund claims or applications
15 may be protested and appealed in accordance with Section 7 of this Act[KRS
16 49.220] and 131.110. No state government agency shall refund ad valorem taxes,
