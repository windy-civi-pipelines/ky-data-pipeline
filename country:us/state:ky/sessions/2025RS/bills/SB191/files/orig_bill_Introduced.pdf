4 As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires:

7 is the proximate cause producing a harmful change in the human organism
8 evidenced by objective medical findings. "Injury" does not include the effects of the
9 natural aging process, and does not include any communicable disease unless the
10 risk of contracting the disease is increased by the nature of the employment.
11 "Injury" when used generally, unless the context indicates otherwise, shall include
12 an occupational disease and damage to a prosthetic appliance, but shall not include
13 a psychological, psychiatric, or stress-related change in the human organism, unless
14 it is a direct result of a physical injury or is a diagnosis of class 2 or greater post-
15 traumatic stress disorder, diagnosed under the latest version of the Diagnostic
16 and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and determined according to the

25 work is performed and the occupational disease, and which can be seen to have
26 followed as a natural incident to the work as a result of the exposure occasioned by
27 the nature of the employment and which can be fairly traced to the employment as

6 342.340(1) shall be the projected value of the employer's workers' compensation
7 claims for the next calendar year as calculated by the commissioner using
8 generally-accepted actuarial methods as follows:
9 (a) The base period shall be the earliest three (3) calendar years of the five (5)
10 calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year for which the
11 calculation is made. The commissioner shall identify each claim of the
12 employer which has an injury date or date of last injurious exposure to the
13 cause of an occupational disease during each one (1) of the three (3) calendar
14 years to be used as the base, and shall assign a value to each claim. The value
15 shall be the total of the indemnity benefits paid to date and projected to be
16 paid, adjusted to current benefit levels, plus the medical benefits paid to date
17 and projected to be paid for the life of the claim, plus the cost of medical and
18 vocational rehabilitation paid to date and projected to be paid. Adjustment to
19 current benefit levels shall be done by multiplying the weekly indemnity
20 benefit for each claim by the number obtained by dividing the statewide
21 average weekly wage which will be in effect for the year for which the
22 premium is being calculated by the statewide average weekly wage in effect
23 during the year in which the injury or date of the last exposure occurred. The
24 total value of the claims using the adjusted weekly benefit shall then be
25 calculated by the commissioner. Values for claims in which awards have been
26 made or settlements reached because of findings of permanent partial or
27 permanent total disability shall be calculated using the mortality and interest

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1160
1 discount assumptions used in the latest available statistical plan of the
2 advisory rating organization defined in Subtitle 13 of KRS Chapter 304. The
3 sum of all calculated values shall be computed for all claims in the base
4 period;
5 (b) The commissioner shall obtain the annual payroll for each of the three (3)
6 years in the base period for each employer carrying his or her own risk from
7 records of the department and from the records of the Department of
8 Workforce Development, Education and Labor Cabinet. The commissioner
9 shall multiply each of the three (3) years of payroll by the number obtained by
10 dividing the statewide average weekly wage which will be in effect for the
11 year in which the premium is being calculated by the statewide average
12 weekly wage in effect in each of the years of the base period;
13 (c) The commissioner shall divide the total of the adjusted claim values for the
14 three (3) year base period by the total adjusted payroll for the same three (3)
15 year period. The value so calculated shall be multiplied by 1.25 and shall then
16 be multiplied by the employer's most recent annualized payroll, calculated
17 using records of the department and the Department of Workforce
18 Development data which shall be made available for this purpose on a
19 quarterly basis as reported, to obtain the premium for the next calendar year
20 for assessment purposes under KRS 342.122;
21 (d) For November 1, 1987, through December 31, 1988, premium for each
22 employer carrying its own risk shall be an amount calculated by the board
23 pursuant to the provisions contained in this subsection and such premium
24 shall be provided to each employer carrying its own risk and to the funding
25 commission on or before January 1, 1988. Thereafter, the calculations set
26 forth in this subsection shall be performed annually, at the time each employer
27 applies or renews its application for certification to carry its own risk for the
Page 10 of 60
XXXX 2/17/2025 2:52 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1160
1 next twelve (12) month period and submits payroll and other data in support
2 of the application. The employer and the funding commission shall be notified
3 at the time of the certification or recertification of the premium calculated by
4 the commissioner, which shall form the employer's basis for assessments
5 pursuant to KRS 342.122 for the calendar year beginning on January 1
6 following the date of certification or recertification;
7 (e) If an employer having fewer than five (5) years of doing business in this state
8 applies to carry its own risk and is so certified, its premium for the purposes
9 of KRS 342.122 shall be based on the lesser number of years of experience as
10 may be available including the two (2) most recent years if necessary to create
11 a three (3) year base period. If the employer has less than two (2) years of
12 operation in this state available for the premium calculation, then its premium
13 shall be the greater of the value obtained by the calculation called for in this
14 subsection or the amount of security required by the commissioner pursuant to
15 KRS 342.340(1);
16 (f) If an employer is certified to carry its own risk after having previously insured
17 the risk, its premium shall be calculated using values obtained from claims
18 incurred while insured for as many of the years of the base period as may be
19 necessary to create a full three (3) year base. After the employer is certified to
20 carry its own risk and has paid all amounts due for assessments upon
21 premiums paid while insured, the employer shall be assessed only upon the
22 premium calculated under this subsection;
23 (g) "Premium" for each employer defined in KRS 342.630(2) shall be calculated
24 as set forth in this subsection; and
25 (h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, the premium of any
26 employer authorized to carry its own risk for purposes of assessments due
27 under this chapter shall be no less than thirty cents ($0.30) per one hundred

2 Section 4. KRS 342.035 is amended to read as follows:
3 (1) Periodically, the commissioner shall promulgate administrative regulations to adopt
4 a schedule of fees for the purpose of ensuring that all fees, charges, and
5 reimbursements under KRS 342.020 and this section shall be fair, current, and
6 reasonable and shall be limited to such charges as are fair, current, and reasonable
7 for similar treatment of injured persons in the same community for like services,
8 where treatment is paid for by general health insurers. In determining what fees are
9 reasonable, the commissioner may also consider the increased security of payment
10 afforded by this chapter. On or before November 1, 1994, and on July 1 every two
11 (2) years thereafter, the schedule of fees contained in administrative regulations
12 promulgated pursuant to this section shall be reviewed and updated, if appropriate.
13 Within ten (10) days of April 4, 1994, the commissioner shall execute a contract
14 with an appropriately qualified consultant pursuant to which each of the following
15 elements within the workers' compensation system are evaluated; the methods of
16 health care delivery; quality assurance and utilization mechanisms; type, frequency,
17 and intensity of services; risk management programs; and the schedule of fees
18 contained in administrative regulation. The consultant shall present
19 recommendations based on its review to the commissioner not later than sixty (60)
20 days following execution of the contract. The commissioner shall consider these
21 recommendations and, not later than thirty (30) days after their receipt, promulgate

1 covered by a workers' compensation insurance plan for the treatment of a work-
2 related injury or occupational disease, in excess of that provided by a schedule of
3 fees, or cause the credit of any employee to be impaired by reason of the
4 employee's failure or refusal to pay the excess charge. When an administrative law
5 judge determines a statement for services is not compensable because it was
6 submitted more than forty-five (45) days after the treatment date, the medical
7 provider shall not seek payment from the employee or the employee's legal
8 counsel. In addition to the penalty imposed in KRS 342.990 for violations of this
9 subsection, any individual who sustains damages by any act in violation of the
10 provisions of this subsection shall have a civil cause of action in Circuit Court to
11 enjoin further violations and to recover the actual damages sustained by the
12 individual, together with the costs of the lawsuit, including a reasonable attorney's
13 fee.
14 (3) Where these requirements are furnished by a public hospital or other institution,
15 payment thereof shall be made to the proper authorities conducting it. No
16 compensation shall be payable for the death or disability of an employee if his or
17 her death is caused, or if and insofar as his or her disability is aggravated, caused,
18 or continued, by an unreasonable failure to submit to or follow any competent
19 surgical treatment or medical aid or advice.
20 (4) The commissioner shall, by December 1, 1994, promulgate administrative
21 regulations to adopt a schedule of fees for the purpose of regulating charges by

24 the employer. The workers' compensation medical fee schedule for physicians, 803
25 KAR 25:089, having an effective date of February 9, 1995, shall remain in effect
26 until July 1, 1996, or until the effective date of any amendments promulgated by the
27 commissioner, whichever occurs first, it being determined that this administrative

4 section.
5 (5) (a) To ensure compliance with subsections (1) and (4) of this section, the
6 commissioner shall promulgate administrative regulations by December 31,

8 insured employer to certify to the commissioner the program or plan it has
9 adopted to ensure compliance.

11 conducted by a qualified independent person, firm, company, or other entity
12 hired by the commissioner, in accordance with the personal service contract
13 provisions contained in KRS 45A.690 to 45A.725, to ensure that the
14 requirements of subsection (1) of this section are being met. The independent
15 person, firm, company, or other entity selected by the commissioner to
16 conduct the audit shall protect the confidentiality of any information it

18 only to the commissioner, and shall use the information for no other purpose
19 than the audit required by this paragraph.
20 (c) The commissioner shall promulgate administrative regulations governing
21 medical provider utilization review activities conducted by an insurance
22 carrier, self-insured group, or self-insured employer pursuant to this chapter.
23 Utilization review required under administrative regulations may be waived if
24 the insurance carrier, self-insured group, or self-insured employer agrees that
25 the recommended medical treatment is medically necessary and appropriate or
26 if the injured employee elects not to proceed with the recommended medical
27 treatment.

14 fee for photocopying requested documents. However, in no event shall a
15 photocopying fee of a medical provider or photocopying service exceed fifty cents
16 ($0.50) per page. However, a medical provider shall not charge a fee when the
17 initial copy of medical records is provided to the injured worker or his or her
18 attorney in response to a written request pursuant to KRS 422.317. In addition,

23 based treatment guidelines for medical treatment for use by medical providers
24 under this chapter, including but not limited to chronic pain management
25 treatment and opioid use, and promulgate administrative regulations in order
26 to implement the developed or adopted practice parameters or evidenced-

18 (3) Except for reopening solely for determination of the compensability of medical
19 expenses, fraud, entitlement to rehabilitation as set forth in KRS 342.710, or
20 conforming the award as set forth in KRS 342.730(1)(c)2., or for reducing a

3 claim beyond four (4) years following the date of the final, nonappealable original
4 award or original order.
5 (4) Reopening and review under this section shall be had upon notice to the parties and

8 compensation previously awarded, within the maximum and minimum provided in
9 this chapter, or change or revoke a previous order. The administrative law judge
10 shall immediately send all parties a copy of the subsequent order or award.
11 Reopening shall not affect the previous order or award as to any sums already paid
12 thereunder, and any change in the amount of compensation shall be ordered only
13 from the date of filing the motion to reopen. No employer shall suspend benefits
14 during pendency of any reopening procedures except upon order of the

16 (5) (a) Upon the application of the affected employee, and a showing of progression
17 of his or her previously-diagnosed occupational pneumoconiosis resulting

6 benefit amount which shall be apportioned in accordance with the provisions
7 of KRS 342.316.
8 (6) In a reopening or review proceeding where there has been additional permanent
9 partial disability awarded, the increase shall not extend the original period, unless
10 the combined prior disability and increased disability exceeds fifty percent (50%),
11 but less than one hundred percent (100%), in which event the awarded period shall
12 not exceed five hundred twenty (520) weeks, from commencement date of the
13 original disability previously awarded. The law in effect on the date of the original
14 injury controls the rights of the parties.
15 (7) Where an agreement has become an award by approval of the administrative law
16 judge, and a reopening and review of that award is initiated, no statement contained
17 in the agreement, whether as to jurisdiction, liability of the employer, nature and
18 extent of disability, or as to any other matter, shall be considered by the
19 administrative law judge as an admission against the interests of any party. The
20 parties may raise any issue upon reopening and review of this type of award which
21 could have been considered upon an original application for benefits.
22 (8) The time limitation prescribed in this section shall apply to all claims irrespective of
23 when they were incurred, or when the award was entered, or the settlement
24 approved. However, claims decided prior to December 12, 1996, may be reopened
25 within four (4) years of the award or order or within four (4) years of December 12,
26 1996, whichever is later, provided that the exceptions to reopening established in

4 Section 8. KRS 342.310 is amended to read as follows:
5 (1) If any administrative law judge, the board, or any court before whom any
6 proceedings are brought under this chapter determines that such proceedings have
7 been brought, prosecuted, or defended without reasonable ground, he, she or it may
8 assess the whole cost of the proceedings which shall include actual expenses but not
9 be limited to the following: court costs, travel expenses, deposition costs, physician
10 expenses for attendance fees at depositions, attorney fees, and all other out-of-
11 pocket expenses upon the party who has so brought, prosecuted, or defended them.
12 (2) If any administrative law judge, the board, or any court before whom any
13 proceedings are brought under this chapter determines that a party has committed
14 acts in violation of KRS 342.335(1) or (2), that party may be ordered to make
15 restitution for any compensation paid as a result of the commission of such acts.
16 (3) If an administrative law judge determines a medical dispute was filed frivolously
17 or for the purpose of harassment by an employer, its third-party administrator, or
18 the responsible insurer, in addition to the attorney's fees in subsection (4)(i)
19 Section 2 of this Act, the administrative law judge may fine the employer an
20 amount not less than one thousand dollars ($1,000) and not more than five
21 thousand dollars ($5,000) to be paid to the employee.

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1160
1 the University of Kentucky, the University of Louisville, or the University of
2 Pikeville medical schools may perform hearing loss evaluations. For
3 workers who have become affected by occupational diseases, the
4 commissioner shall contract with the University of Kentucky,[ and] the
5 University of Louisville, and the University of Pikeville medical schools.
6 (b) In cases alleging coal workers' pneumoconiosis, in addition to the medical
7 schools listed in this subsection, the commissioner may contract with
8 medical professionals who are[, or other physicians otherwise] duly qualified
9 as "B" readers[ who are licensed in the Commonwealth] and who are board-
10 certified pulmonary specialists.
11 (c) Referral for evaluation may be made whenever a medical question is at issue.
12 Medical professionals affiliated with the University of Kentucky, the
13 University of Louisville, or the University of Pikeville medical schools may
14 perform the evaluations.
15 (2) The medical professionals[physicians] and institutions performing evaluations
16 pursuant to this section shall render reports encompassing their findings and
17 opinions in the form prescribed by the commissioner. Except as otherwise provided
18 in KRS 342.316, the clinical findings and opinions of the designated evaluator shall
19 be afforded presumptive weight by administrative law judges and the burden to
20 overcome such findings and opinions shall fall on the opponent of that evidence.
21 When administrative law judges reject the clinical findings and opinions of the
22 designated evaluator, they shall specifically state in the order the reasons for
23 rejecting that evidence.
24 (3) The commissioner or an administrative law judge may, upon the application of any
25 party or upon his or her own motion, direct appointment by the commissioner,
26 pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, of an[a medical] evaluator to make any
27 necessary medical examination of the employee. The[Such medical] evaluator shall
Page 32 of 60
XXXX 2/17/2025 2:52 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1160
1 file with the commissioner within fifteen (15) days after such examination a written
2 report. The appointed evaluator[medical evaluator appointed] may charge a
3 reasonable fee not exceeding fees established by the commissioner for those
4 services.
5 (4) Within thirty (30) days of the receipt of a statement for the evaluation, the employer
6 or carrier shall pay the cost of the examination. Upon notice from the commissioner
7 that an evaluation has been scheduled, the insurance carrier shall forward within
8 seven (7) days to the employee the expenses of travel necessary to attend the
9 evaluation at a rate equal to that paid to state employees for travel by private
10 automobile while conducting state business.
11 (5) Upon claims in which it is finally determined that the injured worker was not the
12 employee at the time of injury of an employer covered by this chapter, the special
13 fund shall reimburse the carrier for any evaluation performed pursuant to this
14 section for which the carrier has been erroneously compelled to make payment.
15 (6) Not less often than annually the designee of the secretary of the Cabinet for Health
16 and Family Services shall assess the performance of the medical schools and render
17 findings as to whether evaluations conducted under this section are being rendered
18 in a timely manner, whether examinations are conducted in accordance with
19 medically recognized techniques, whether impairment ratings are in conformity
20 with standards prescribed by the "Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent
21 Impairment," and whether coal workers' pneumoconiosis examinations are
22 conducted in accordance with the standards prescribed in this chapter.
23 (7) The General Assembly finds that good public policy mandates the realization of the
24 potential advantages, both economic and effectual, of the use of telehealth. The
25 commissioner may, to the extent that he or she finds it feasible and appropriate,
26 require the use of telehealth, as defined in KRS 211.332, in the independent medical
27 evaluation process required by this chapter.

1 Section 10. KRS 342.316 is amended to read as follows:
2 (1) (a) The employer liable for compensation for occupational disease shall be the
3 employer in whose employment the employee was last exposed to the hazard
4 of the occupational disease. During any period in which this section is
5 applicable to a coal mine, an operator who acquired it or substantially all of its
6 assets from a person who was its operator on and after January 1, 1973, shall
7 be liable for, and secure the payment of, the benefits which would have been
8 payable by the prior operator under this section with respect to miners
9 previously employed in the mine if it had not been acquired by such later
10 operator. At the same time, however, this subsection does not relieve the prior
11 operator of any liability under this section. Also, it does not affect whatever
12 rights the later operator might have against the prior operator.
13 (b) The time of the beginning of compensation payments shall be the date of the
14 employee's last injurious exposure to the cause of the disease, or the date of
15 actual disability, whichever is later.
16 (2) The procedure with respect to the giving of notice and determination of claims in
17 occupational disease cases and the compensation and medical benefits payable for
18 disability or death due to the disease shall be the same as in cases of accidental
19 injury or death under the general provisions of this chapter, except that notice of
20 claim shall be given to the employer as soon as practicable after the employee first
21 experiences a distinct manifestation of an occupational disease in the form of
22 symptoms reasonably sufficient to apprise the employee that he or she has
23 contracted the disease, or a diagnosis of the disease is first communicated to him or
24 her, whichever shall first occur.
25 (3) The procedure for filing occupational disease claims shall be as follows:
26 (a) The application for resolution of claim shall set forth the complete work
27 history of the employee with a concise description of injurious exposure to a
Page 34 of 60

1 specific occupational disease, together with the name and addresses of the
2 employer or employers with the approximate dates of employment. The
3 application shall also include at least one (1) written medical report
4 supporting his or her claim. This medical report shall be made on the basis of
5 clinical or X-ray examination performed in accordance with accepted medical
6 standards and shall contain full and complete statements of all examinations
7 performed and the results thereof. The report shall be made by a duly-licensed
8 medical professional[physician]. The commissioner shall promulgate
9 administrative regulations which prescribe the format of the medical report
10 required by this section and the manner in which the report shall be
11 completed.
12 1. For coal-related occupational pneumoconiosis claims, each clinical
13 examination shall include a chest X-ray interpretation by a National
14 Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) certified "B"
15 reader. The chest X-ray upon which the report is made shall be filed
16 with the application as well as spirometric tests when pulmonary
17 dysfunction is alleged.
18 2. For other compensable occupational pneumoconiosis claims, each
19 clinical examination shall include a chest X-ray examination and
20 appropriate pulmonary function tests.
21 (b) To be admissible, medical evidence offered in any proceeding under this
22 chapter for determining a claim for occupational pneumoconiosis resulting
23 from exposure to coal dust shall comply with accepted medical standards as
24 follows:
25 1. Chest X-rays shall be of acceptable quality with respect to exposure and
26 development and shall be indelibly labeled with the date of the X-ray
27 and the name and Social Security number of the claimant. Reports by

8 Classification and be accompanied by a completed copy of the
9 latest ILO Classification report.
10 Only interpretations by National Institute of Occupational Safety and
11 Health (NIOSH) certified "B" readers shall be admissible.
12 2. Spirometric testing shall be conducted in accordance with the standards
13 recommended in the "Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent
14 Impairment" and the 1978 ATS epidemiology standardization project
15 with the exception that the predicted normal values for lung function
16 shall not be adjusted based upon the race of the subject. The FVC or the
17 FEV1 values shall represent the largest of such values obtained from
18 three (3) acceptable forced expiratory volume maneuvers as corrected to
19 BTPS (body temperature, ambient pressure and saturated with water
20 vapor at these conditions) and the variance between the two (2) largest
21 acceptable FVC values shall be either less than five percent (5%) of the
22 largest FVC value or less than one hundred (100) milliliters, whichever
23 is greater. The variance between the two (2) largest acceptable FEV1
24 values shall be either less than five percent (5%) of the largest FEV1
25 value or less than one hundred (100) milliliters, whichever is greater.

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1160
1 testing and a copy of the spirometric chart and tracings from which
2 spirometric values submitted as evidence were taken. If it is shown that
3 the spirometric testing is not valid due to inadequate cooperation or poor
4 effort on the part of the claimant, the claimant's right to take or
5 prosecute any proceedings under this chapter shall be suspended until
6 the refusal or obstruction ceases. No compensation shall be payable for
7 the period during which the refusal or obstruction continues.
8 3. The commissioner shall promulgate administrative regulations pursuant
9 to KRS Chapter 13A as necessary to effectuate the purposes of this
10 section. The commissioner shall periodically review the applicability of
11 the spirometric test values contained in the "Guides to the Evaluation of
12 Permanent Impairment" and may by administrative regulation substitute
13 other spirometric test values which are found to be more closely
14 representative of the normal pulmonary function of the coal mining
15 population.
16 4. The procedure for determination of occupational disease claims shall be
17 as follows:
18 a. Immediately upon receipt of an application for resolution of claim,
19 the commissioner shall notify the responsible employer and all
20 other interested parties and shall furnish them with a full and
21 complete copy of the application.
22 b. The commissioner shall assign the claim to an administrative law
23 judge and shall promptly refer the employee to a duly qualified
24 medical professional who is board certified in the area
25 concerning the alleged occupational disease, and in the case of
26 claims for coal workers' pneumoconiosis to a medical
27 professional duly who is qualified as a "B" reader[ physician who

1 is licensed in the Commonwealth] and who is a board-certified
2 pulmonary specialist as set forth pursuant to KRS 342.315 and
3 342.794(1). The report from this examination shall be provided to
4 all parties of record. The employee shall not be referred by the
5 commissioner for examination within two (2) years following any
6 prior referral for examination for the same disease.
7 c. The commissioner shall develop a procedure to annually audit the
8 performance of medical professionals[physicians] and facilities
9 that are selected to perform examinations pursuant to this section.
10 The audit shall include an evaluation of the medical
11 professional[physician] and facility with respect to the timeliness
12 and completeness of the reports and the frequency at which the
13 medical professional's[physician's] classification of an X-ray
14 differs from those of the other medical professionals[physicians]
15 of that X-ray. The commissioner shall remove a medical
16 professional[physician] or facility from selection consideration if
17 the medical professional[physician] or facility consistently
18 renders incomplete or untimely reports or if the X-ray[physician's]
19 interpretations[ of X-rays] are not in conformity with the readings
20 of other medical professionals[physicians] of record at least fifty
21 percent (50%) of the time. The report required under this
22 subdivision shall be provided to the Interim Joint Committee on
23 Economic Development and Workforce Investment on or before
24 July 1, 2019, and on or before July 1 of each year thereafter.
25 d. In coal workers' pneumoconiosis claims, if the medical
26 professional[physician] selected by the commissioner interprets an
27 X-ray as positive for complicated coal workers' pneumoconiosis,
Page 38 of 60
XXXX 2/17/2025 2:52 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1160
1 the commissioner shall refer the employee to the facility at which
2 the claimant was previously evaluated for a computerized
3 tomography scan in order to verify the findings. The computerized
4 tomography scan shall be interpreted by the facility and a report
5 shall be filed with the commissioner. The employer, insurer, or
6 payment obligor shall pay the cost of the examination pursuant to
7 the medical fee schedule. The administrative law judge may rely
8 upon the findings in the report in accepting or rejecting ILO
9 radiographic evidence of the disease required under KRS 342.732
10 for benefit determination.
11 e. Within forty-five (45) days following the notice of filing an
12 application for resolution of claim, the employer or carrier shall
13 notify the commissioner and all parties of record of its acceptance
14 or denial of the claim. A denial shall be in writing and shall state
15 the specific basis for the denial.
16 f. The administrative law judge shall conduct such proceedings as
17 are necessary to resolve the claim and shall have authority to grant
18 or deny any relief, including interlocutory relief, to order
19 additional proof, to conduct a benefit review conference, or to take
20 such other action as may be appropriate to resolve the claim.
21 g. Unless a voluntary settlement is reached by the parties, or the
22 parties agree otherwise, the administrative law judge shall issue a
23 written determination within sixty (60) days following a hearing.
24 The written determination shall address all contested issues and
25 shall be enforceable under KRS 342.305.
26 h. Within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the statement for the
27 evaluation, the employer, insurer, or payment obligor shall pay the
Page 39 of 60
XXXX 2/17/2025 2:52 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1160
1 cost of the examination. Upon notice from the commissioner that
2 an evaluation has been scheduled, the employer, insurer, or
3 payment obligor shall forward the expenses of travel necessary to
4 attend the evaluation at the state employee reimbursement rates to
5 the employee within seven (7) days. However, if the employee has
6 alleged a pulmonary dysfunction but has not filed spirometric
7 evidence as required by paragraph (a) of this subsection at the time
8 the evaluation is scheduled by the commissioner, the employee
9 will be responsible for fifty percent (50%) of the cost of the
10 evaluation.
11 5. The procedure for appeal from a determination of an administrative law
12 judge shall be as set forth in KRS 342.285.
13 (4) (a) The right to compensation under this chapter resulting from an occupational
14 disease shall be forever barred unless a claim is filed with the commissioner
15 within three (3) years after the last injurious exposure to the occupational
16 hazard or after the employee first experiences a distinct manifestation of an
17 occupational disease in the form of symptoms reasonably sufficient to apprise
18 the employee that he or she has contracted the disease, whichever shall last
19 occur; and if death results from the occupational disease within that period,
20 unless a claim therefor be filed with the commissioner within three (3) years
21 after the death; but that notice of claim shall be deemed waived in case of
22 disability or death where the employer, or its insurance carrier, voluntarily
23 makes payment therefor, or if the incurrence of the disease or the death of the
24 employee and its cause was known to the employer. However, the right to
25 compensation for any occupational disease shall be forever barred, unless a
26 claim is filed with the commissioner within five (5) years from the last
27 injurious exposure to the occupational hazard, except that, in cases of
Page 40 of 60
XXXX 2/17/2025 2:52 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1160
1 radiation disease, asbestos-related disease, or a type of cancer specified in
2 KRS 61.315(11)(b), a claim must be filed within twenty (20) years from the
3 last injurious exposure to the occupational hazard.
4 (b) Income benefits for the disease of pneumoconiosis resulting from exposure to
5 coal dust or death therefrom shall not be payable unless the employee has
6 been exposed to the hazards of such pneumoconiosis in the Commonwealth of
7 Kentucky over a continuous period of not less than two (2) years during the
8 ten (10) years immediately preceding the date of his or her last exposure to
9 such hazard, or for any five (5) of the fifteen (15) years immediately
10 preceding the date of such last exposure.
11 (5) The amount of compensation payable for disability due to occupational disease or
12 for death from the disease, and the time and manner of its payment, shall be as
13 provided for under the general provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act, but:
14 (a) In no event shall the payment exceed the amounts that were in effect at the
15 time of the last injurious exposure;
16 (b) The time of the beginning of compensation payments shall be the date of the
17 employee's last injurious exposure to the cause of the disease, or the date of
18 actual disability, whichever is later; and
19 (c) In case of death where the employee has been awarded compensation or made
20 timely claim within the period provided for in this section, and an employee
21 has suffered continuous disability to the date of his or her death occurring at
22 any time within twenty (20) years from the date of disability, his or her
23 dependents, if any, shall be awarded compensation for his or her death as
24 provided for under the general provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act
25 and in this section, except as provided in KRS 342.750(6).
26 (6) If an autopsy has been performed, no testimony relative thereto shall be admitted
27 unless the employer or its representative has available findings and reports of the
Page 41 of 60
XXXX 2/17/2025 2:52 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1160
1 pathologist or doctor who performed the autopsy examination.
2 (7) No compensation shall be payable for occupational disease if the employee at the
3 time of entering the employment of the employer by whom compensation would
4 otherwise be payable, falsely represented himself or herself, in writing, as not
5 having been previously disabled, laid-off, or compensated in damages or otherwise,
6 because of the occupational disease, or failed or omitted truthfully to state to the
7 best of his or her knowledge, in answer to written inquiry made by the employer,
8 the place, duration, and nature of previous employment, or, to the best of his or her
9 knowledge, the previous state of his or her health.
10 (8) No compensation for death from occupational disease shall be payable to any
11 person whose relationship to the deceased, which under the provisions of this
12 chapter would give right to compensation, arose subsequent to the beginning of the
13 first compensable disability, except only for after-born children of a marriage
14 existing at the beginning of such disability.
15 (9) Whenever any claimant misconceives his or her remedy and files an application for
16 adjustment of claim under the general provisions of this chapter and it is
17 subsequently discovered, at any time before the final disposition of the cause, that
18 the claim for injury, disability, or death which was the basis for his or her
19 application should properly have been made under the provisions of this section,
20 then the application so filed may be amended in form or substance, or both, to
21 assert a claim for injury, disability, or death under the provisions of this section, and
22 it shall be deemed to have been so filed as amended on the date of the original filing
23 thereof, and compensation may be awarded that is warranted by the whole evidence
24 pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. When amendment of this type is
25 submitted, further or additional evidence may be heard when deemed necessary.
26 Nothing this section contains shall be construed to be or permit a waiver of any of
27 the provisions of this chapter with reference to notice of time for filing of a claim,
Page 42 of 60
XXXX 2/17/2025 2:52 PM Jacketed

1 but notice of filing a claim, if given or done, shall be deemed to be a notice of filing
2 of a claim under provisions of this chapter, if given or done within the time required
3 by this subsection.
4 (10) When an employee has an occupational disease that is covered by this chapter, the
5 employer in whose employment he or she was last injuriously exposed to the hazard
6 of the disease, and the employer's insurance carrier, if any, at the time of the
7 exposure, shall alone be liable therefor, without right to contribution from any prior
8 employer or insurance carrier, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.
9 (11) (a) For claims filed on or before June 30, 2017, income benefits for coal-related
10 occupational pneumoconiosis shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by the
11 Kentucky coal workers' pneumoconiosis fund as established in KRS 342.1242
12 and fifty percent (50%) by the employer in whose employment the employee
13 was last exposed to the hazard of that occupational disease.
14 (b) Income benefits for coal-related occupational pneumoconiosis for claims filed
15 after June 30, 2017, shall be paid by the employer in whose employment the
16 employee was last exposed to the hazards of coal workers' pneumoconiosis.
17 (c) Compensation for all other occupational disease shall be paid by the employer
18 in whose employment the employee was last exposed to the hazards of the
19 occupational disease.
20 (12) A concluded claim for benefits by reason of contraction of coal workers'
21 pneumoconiosis in the severance or processing of coal shall bar any subsequent
22 claim for benefits by reason of contraction of coal workers' pneumoconiosis, unless
23 there has occurred in the interim between the conclusion of the first claim and the
24 filing of the second claim at least two (2) years of employment wherein the
25 employee was continuously exposed to the hazards of the disease in the
26 Commonwealth.

5 employee shall be subject to the following maximum limits:
6 (a) For attorney-client employment contracts entered into and signed after July
7 14, 2000, but before July 14, 2018, twenty percent (20%) of the first twenty-
8 five thousand dollars ($25,000) of the award, fifteen percent (15%) of the next
9 ten thousand dollars ($10,000), and five percent (5%) of the remainder of the
10 award, not to exceed a maximum fee of twelve thousand dollars ($12,000).
11 This fee shall be paid by the employee from the proceeds of the award or
12 settlement; and
13 (b) For attorney-client employment contracts entered into and signed on or after
14 July 14, 2018, twenty percent (20%) of the first twenty-five thousand dollars
15 ($25,000) of the award, fifteen percent (15%) of the next twenty-five
16 thousand dollars ($25,000), and ten percent (10%) of the remainder of the
17 award, not to exceed a maximum fee of eighteen thousand dollars ($18,000).
18 This fee shall be paid by the employee from the proceeds of the award or
19 settlement.
20 (3) In approving an allowance of attorney's fees, the administrative law judge shall
21 consider the extent, complexity, and quality of services rendered, and in the case of
22 death, the Remarriage Tables of the Dutch Royal Insurance Institute. An attorney's
23 fee may be denied or reduced upon proof of solicitation by the attorney. However,
24 this provision shall not be construed to preclude advertising in conformity with
25 standards prescribed by the Kentucky Supreme Court.
26 (4) No attorney's fee in any case involving benefits under this chapter shall be paid
27 until the fee is approved by the administrative law judge, and any contract for the

1 payment of attorney's fees otherwise than as provided in this section shall be void.
2 The motion for approval of an attorney's fee shall be submitted within thirty (30)
3 days following finality of the claim. Except when the attorney's fee is to be paid by
4 the employer or carrier, the attorney's fee shall be paid in one (1) of the following
5 ways:
6 (a) The employee may pay the attorney's fee out of his or her personal funds or
7 from the proceeds of a lump-sum settlement; or
8 (b) The administrative law judge, upon request of the employee, may order the

10 and deduct the attorney's fee from the weekly benefits payable to the
11 employee in equal installments over the duration of the award or until the
12 attorney's fee has been paid, commuting sufficient sums to pay the fee.
13 (5) At the commencement of the attorney-client relationship, the attorney shall explain
14 to the employee the methods by which this section provides for the payment of the
15 attorney's fee, and the employee shall select the method in which the attorney's fee
16 is to be paid. His or her selection and statement that he or she fully understands the

18 signed by the employee, at the time the motion for approval of the attorney's fee is
19 submitted. The commissioner shall develop the format and content of the form to be
20 used pursuant to this section. The form to be used shall list on its face all options
21 permitted in this section for the payment of an attorney's fees and contain an
22 explanation in nontechnical language of each method.
23 (6) In a claim that has been reopened pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, an
24 attorney's fee may be awarded by the administrative law judge subject to the limits
25 set forth in subsection (2) of this section. In awarding the attorney's fee, the

1 be awarded. No attorney's fee shall be allowed or approved exceeding the amounts
2 provided in subsection (2)(a) of this section applicable to any additional amount
3 recovered.
4 (7) Attorney's fees for representing employers in proceedings under this chapter
5 pursuant to contract with the employer shall be subject to approval of the
6 administrative law judge in the same manner as prescribed for attorney
7 representation of employees. Employer attorney's fees are subject to the limitation
8 of eighteen thousand dollars ($18,000) maximum fees except that fees for
9 representing employers shall not be dependent upon the result achieved. Employer
10 attorney's fees may be paid on a periodic basis while a claim is adjudicated and the
11 payments need not be approved until the claims resolution process is completed. All
12 such approved fees shall be paid by the employer and in no event shall exceed the
13 amount the employer agreed by contract to pay.
14 (8) The commissioner shall promulgate administrative regulations in accordance
15 with KRS Chapter 13A establishing a schedule of fees that may be charged by
16 court reporters for services rendered pursuant to KRS Chapter 342.
17 Section 12. KRS 342.730 is amended to read as follows:
18 (1) Except as provided in KRS 342.732, income benefits for disability shall be paid to
19 the employee as follows:
20 (a) For temporary or permanent total disability, sixty-six and two-thirds percent
21 (66-2/3%) of the employee's average weekly wage but not more than one
22 hundred ten percent (110%) of the state average weekly wage and not less
23 than twenty percent (20%) of the state average weekly wage as determined in
24 KRS 342.740 during that disability. Nonwork-related impairment and
25 conditions compensable under KRS 342.732 and hearing loss covered in KRS
26 342.7305 shall not be considered in determining whether the employee is
27 totally disabled for purposes of this subsection.

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1160
1 (b) For permanent partial disability, sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of
2 the employee's average weekly wage but not more than eighty-two and one-
3 half percent (82.5%) of the state average weekly wage as determined by KRS
4 342.740, multiplied by the permanent impairment rating caused by the injury
5 or occupational disease as determined by the "Guides to the Evaluation of
6 Permanent Impairment," times the factor set forth in the table that follows:
7 AMA Impairment Factor
8 0 to 5% 0.65
9 6 to 10% 0.85
10 11 to 15% 1.00
11 16 to 20% 1.00
12 21 to 25% 1.15
13 26 to 30% 1.35
14 31 to 35% 1.50
15 36% and above 1.70
16 Any temporary total disability period within the maximum period for
17 permanent, partial disability benefits shall extend the maximum period but
18 shall not make payable a weekly benefit exceeding that determined in
19 subsection (1)(a) of this section. Notwithstanding any section of this chapter
20 to the contrary, there shall be no minimum weekly income benefit for
21 permanent partial disability and medical benefits shall be paid for the duration
22 of the disability.
23 (c) 1. If, due to an injury, an employee does not retain the physical capacity to
24 return to the type of work that the employee performed at the time of
25 injury, the benefit for permanent partial disability shall be multiplied by
26 three (3) times the amount otherwise determined under paragraph (b) of
27 this subsection, but this provision shall not be construed so as to extend
Page 47 of 60
XXXX 2/17/2025 2:52 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1160
1 the duration of payments; or
2 2. If an employee returns to work at a weekly wage equal to or greater than
3 the average weekly wage at the time of injury, the weekly benefit for
4 permanent partial disability shall be determined under paragraph (b) of
5 this subsection for each week during which that employment is
6 sustained. During any period of cessation of that employment,
7 temporary or permanent, for any reason, with or without cause, payment
8 of weekly benefits for permanent partial disability during the period of
9 cessation shall be two (2) times the amount otherwise payable under
10 paragraph (b) of this subsection. This provision shall not be construed so
11 as to extend the duration of payments.
12 3. Recognizing that limited education and advancing age impact an
13 employee's post-injury earning capacity, an education and age factor,
14 when applicable, shall be added to the income benefit multiplier set
15 forth in paragraph (c)1. of this subsection. If at the time of injury, the
16 employee had less than eight (8) years of formal education, the
17 multiplier shall be increased by four-tenths (0.4); if the employee had
18 less than twelve (12) years of education or a high school Equivalency
19 diploma, the multiplier shall be increased by two-tenths (0.2); if the
20 employee was age sixty (60) or older, the multiplier shall be increased
21 by six-tenths (0.6); if the employee was age fifty-five (55) or older, the
22 multiplier shall be increased by four-tenths (0.4); or if the employee was
23 age fifty (50) or older, the multiplier shall be increased by two-tenths
24 (0.2).
25 4. Notwithstanding the provisions of KRS 342.125, a claim may be
26 reopened at any time during the period of permanent partial disability in
27 order to conform the award payments with the requirements of
Page 48 of 60

1 subparagraph 2. of this paragraph.
2 (d) For permanent partial disability, if an employee has a permanent disability
3 rating of fifty percent (50%) or less as a result of a work-related injury, the
4 compensable permanent partial disability period shall be four hundred twenty-
5 five (425) weeks, and if the permanent disability rating is greater than fifty
6 percent (50%), the compensable permanent partial disability period shall be
7 five hundred twenty (520) weeks from the date the impairment or disability
8 exceeding fifty percent (50%) arises. Benefits payable for permanent partial
9 disability shall not exceed ninety-nine percent (99%) of sixty-six and two-
10 thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the employee's average weekly wage as
11 determined under KRS 342.740 and shall not exceed eighty-two and one-half
12 percent (82.5%) of the state average weekly wage, except for benefits payable
13 pursuant to paragraph (c)1. of this subsection, which shall not exceed one
14 hundred ten percent (110%) of the state average weekly wage, nor shall
15 benefits for permanent partial disability be payable for a period exceeding five
16 hundred twenty (520) weeks, notwithstanding that multiplication of
17 impairment times the factor set forth in paragraph (b) of this subsection would
18 yield a greater percentage of disability.
19 (e) For permanent partial disability, impairment for nonwork-related disabilities,
20 conditions previously compensated under this chapter, conditions covered by
21 KRS 342.732, and hearing loss covered in KRS 342.7305 shall not be
22 considered in determining the extent of disability or duration of benefits under
23 this chapter.
24 (2) The period of any income benefits payable under this section on account of any
25 injury shall be reduced by the period of income benefits paid or payable under this
26 chapter on account of a prior injury if income benefits in both cases are for
27 disability of the same member or function, or different parts of the same member or

2 whole or in part would duplicate the income benefits payable on account of the pre-
3 existing disability.
4 (3) Subject to the limitations contained in subsection (4) of this section, when an
5 employee, who has sustained disability compensable under this chapter, and who
6 has filed, or could have timely filed, a valid claim in his or her lifetime, dies from
7 causes other than the injury before the expiration of the compensable period
8 specified, portions of the income benefits specified and unpaid at the individual's
9 death, whether or not accrued or due at his or her death, shall be paid, under an
10 award made before or after the death, for the period specified in this section, to and
11 for the benefit of the persons within the classes at the time of death and in the
12 proportions and upon the conditions specified in this section and in the order
13 named:
14 (a) To the widow or widower, if there is no child under the age of eighteen (18)
15 or incapable of self-support, benefits at fifty percent (50%) of the rate
16 specified in the award; or
17 (b) If there are both a widow or widower and such a child or children, to the
18 widow or widower, forty-five percent (45%) of the benefits specified in the
19 award, or forty percent (40%) of those benefits if such a child or children are
20 not living with the widow or widower; and, in addition thereto, fifteen percent
21 (15%) of the benefits specified in the award to each child. Where there are
22 more than two (2) such children, the indemnity benefits payable on account of
23 two (2) children shall be divided among all the children, share and share alike;
24 or
25 (c) If there is no widow or widower but such a child or children, then to the child
26 or children, fifty percent (50%) of the benefits specified in the award to one

2 benefits payable on account of two (2) children shall be divided equally
3 among all the children; or
4 (d) If there is no survivor in the above classes, then the parent or parents wholly
5 or partly actually dependent for support upon the decedent, or to other wholly
6 or partly actually dependent relatives listed in paragraph (g) of subsection (1)
7 of KRS 342.750, or to both, in proportions that the commissioner provides by
8 administrative regulation.
9 (e) To the widow or widower upon remarriage, up to two (2) years, benefits as
10 specified in the award and proportioned under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this

13 (4) All income benefits payable pursuant to this chapter shall terminate as of the date
14 upon which the employee reaches the age of seventy (70), or four (4) years after the
15 employee's injury or last exposure, whichever last occurs. In like manner all income
16 benefits payable pursuant to this chapter to spouses and dependents shall terminate
17 as of the date upon which the employee would have reached age seventy (70) or
18 four (4) years after the employee's date of injury or date of last exposure, whichever
19 last occurs.
20 (5) All income benefits pursuant to this chapter otherwise payable for temporary total
21 and permanent total disability shall not be offset by unemployment insurance
22 benefits paid for unemployment during the period of temporary total or permanent
23 total disability.
24 (6) All income benefits otherwise payable pursuant to this chapter shall be offset by
25 payments made under an exclusively employer-funded disability plan, exclusively
26 employer-funded disability retirement plan, exclusively employer-funded sickness
27 and accident plan, or salary continuation, which extends income benefits for the

3 inconsistent with this provision.
4 (7) Income benefits otherwise payable pursuant to this chapter for temporary total
5 disability during the period the employee has returned to a light-duty or other
6 alternative job position shall be offset by an amount equal to the employee's gross
7 income minus applicable taxes during the period of light-duty work or work in an
8 alternative job position.
9 (8) If an employee receiving a permanent total disability award returns to work, that

15 (1) (a) For calendar year 1997 and for each calendar year thereafter, for the purpose
16 of funding and prefunding the liabilities of the special fund, financing the
17 administration and operation of the Kentucky Workers' Compensation
18 Funding Commission, and financing the expenditures for all programs in the
19 Department of Workers' Claims, Occupational Safety and Health Review
20 Commission, Workers' Compensation Nominating Committee, Department of

27 assessment rate of nine percent (9%) upon the amount of workers'
Page 53 of 60
XXXX 2/17/2025 2:52 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1160
1 compensation premiums received on and after January 1, 1997, through
2 December 31, 1997, by every insurance carrier writing workers' compensation
3 insurance in the Commonwealth, by every self-insured group operating under
4 the provisions of KRS 342.350(4) and Chapter 304, and against the premium,
5 as defined in KRS 342.0011, of every employer carrying his or her own risk.
6 (b) The funding commission shall, for calendar year 1998 and thereafter, establish
7 for the special fund an assessment rate to be assessed against all premium
8 received during that calendar year which shall produce enough revenue to
9 amortize on a level basis the unfunded liability of the special fund as of June
10 30 preceding January 1 of each year, for the period remaining until December
11 31, 2029. The interest rate to be used in this calculation shall reflect the
12 funding commission's investment experience to date and the current
13 investment policies of the commission. When the claim liabilities of the
14 special fund are fully funded or prefunded, the assessment shall continue
15 for the purpose of financing the administration, operation, and
16 expenditures established in paragraph (a) of this subsection. This
17 assessment shall be imposed upon the amount of workers' compensation
18 premiums received by every insurance carrier writing workers' compensation
19 insurance in the Commonwealth, by every self-insured group operating under
20 the provisions of KRS 342.350(4) and Chapter 304, and against the premium,

23 carrier writing workers' compensation insurance in the Commonwealth, every
24 group of self-insured employers, and each employer carrying its own risk, of
25 the rates which shall become effective on January 1 of each year, unless

1 Workers' Compensation Funding Commission and shall be credited to the
2 benefit reserve fund within the Kentucky Workers' Compensation Funding
3 Commission.
4 (d) The assessments imposed in this chapter shall be in lieu of all other
5 assessments or taxes on workers' compensation premiums.
6 (2) (a) These assessments shall be paid quarterly not later than the thirtieth day of the
7 month following the end of the quarter in which the premium is received.
8 Receipt shall be considered timely through actual physical receipt or by
9 postmark of the United States Postal Service. Employers carrying their own
10 risk and employers defined in KRS 342.630(2) shall pay the annual
11 assessments in four (4) equal quarterly installments.
12 (b) Beginning on January 1, 2020, all assessments shall be electronically remitted
13 to the funding commission quarterly not later than the thirtieth day of the
14 month following the end of the quarter in which the premium is received.

22 insurance carrier collects the assessment from an insured, the assessment shall be
23 collected at the same time and in the same proportion as the premium is collected.
24 The assessment for an insurance policy or other evidence of coverage providing a
25 deductible may be collected in accordance with this chapter on a premium amount
26 that equates to the premium that would have applied without the deductible. Each
27 statement from an insurance carrier presented to an insured reflecting premium and
Page 55 of 60
XXXX 2/17/2025 2:52 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1160
1 assessment amounts shall clearly identify and distinguish the amount to be paid for
2 premium and the amount to be paid for assessments. No insurance carrier shall
3 collect from an insured an amount in excess of the assessment percentages imposed
4 by this chapter. The assessment for an insurance policy or other evidence of
5 coverage providing a deductible may be collected in accordance with this chapter
6 on a premium amount that equates to the premium that would have applied without
7 the deductible. The percentages imposed by this chapter for an insurance policy
8 issued by an insurance company shall be those percentages in effect on the annual
9 effective date of the policy, regardless of the date that the premium is actually
10 received by the insurance company.
11 (4) A self-insured group may elect to report its premiums and to have its assessments
12 computed in the same manner as insurance companies. This election may not be
13 rescinded for at least ten (10) years, nor may this election be made a second time
14 for at least another ten (10) years, except that the board of directors of the funding
15 commission may, at its discretion, waive the ten (10) year ban on a case-by-case

19 assessments required by this section, shall annually require each insurance carrier
20 and each self-insured group to provide a list of employers which it has insured or
21 which are members and the amount collected from each employer. Additionally, the
22 funding commission shall require each entity paying a special fund assessment to
23 report the SIC code for each employer and the amount of premium collected from
24 each SIC code. An insurance carrier or self-insured group may require its insureds
25 or members to furnish the SIC code for each of their employees. However, the
26 failure of any employer to furnish said codes shall not relieve the insurance carrier
27 or self-insured group from the obligation to furnish same to the funding

6 any information and submit any reports the Department of Revenue or the funding
7 commission may require to effectuate the provisions of this section. In addition, the
8 funding commission may enter reciprocal agreements with other governmental
9 agencies for the exchange of information necessary to effectuate the provisions of
10 this section.
11 (7) The special fund shall be required to maintain a central claim registry of all claims
12 to which it is named a party, giving each such claim a unique claim number and
13 thereafter recording the status of each claim on a current basis. The registry shall be
14 established by January 26, 1988, for all claims on which payments were made since
15 July 1, 1986, or which were pending adjudication since July 1, 1986, by audit of all
16 claim files in the possession of the special fund.
17 (8) The fund heretofore designated as the subsequent claim fund is abolished, and there
18 is substituted therefor the special fund as set out by this section, and all moneys and
19 properties owned by the subsequent claim fund are transferred to the special fund.
20 (9) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section or this chapter to the contrary,
21 the total amount of funds collected pursuant to the assessment rates adopted by the
22 funding commission shall not be limited to the provisions of this section.
23 (10) All assessment rates imposed for periods prior to January 1, 1997, under KRS
24 342.122 shall forever remain applicable to premiums received on policies with
25 effective dates prior to January 1, 1997, by every insurance carrier writing workers'
26 compensation insurance in the Commonwealth, by every self-insured group
27 operating under the provision of KRS 342.350(4) and Chapter 304, and against the

2 Section 15. KRS 342.610 is amended to read as follows:
3 (1) Every employer subject to this chapter shall be liable for compensation for injury,
4 occupational disease, or death without regard to fault as a cause of the injury,
5 occupational disease, or death.
6 (2) A contractor who subcontracts all or any part of a contract and his or her carrier
7 shall be liable for the payment of compensation to the employees of the
8 subcontractor unless the subcontractor primarily liable for the payment of such
9 compensation has secured the payment of compensation as provided for in this
10 chapter. Any contractor or his or her carrier who shall become liable for such
11 compensation may recover the amount of such compensation paid and necessary
12 expenses from the subcontractor primarily liable therefor. A person who contracts
13 with another:
14 (a) To have work performed consisting of the removal, excavation, or drilling of
15 soil, rock, or mineral, or the cutting or removal of timber from land; or
16 (b) To have work performed of a kind which is a regular or recurrent part of the
17 work of the trade, business, occupation, or profession of such person

19 a subcontractor. This subsection shall not apply to the owner or lessee of land
20 principally used for agriculture.
21 (3) Liability for compensation shall not apply to injury, occupational disease, or death
22 to the employee if the employee willfully intended to injure or kill himself, herself,
23 or another.

1 scientifically reliable test, that could cause a disturbance of mental or physical
2 capacities, it shall be presumed that the illegal, nonprescribed substance or
3 substances or the prescribed substance or substances in amounts in excess of
4 prescribed amounts caused the injury, occupational disease, or death of the
5 employee and] liability for compensation shall not apply to the injury, occupational
6 disease, or death to the employee if the intoxicating substance is determined to be
7 the proximate cause of the injury, occupational disease, or death to the employee.
8 (5) If injury or death results to an employee through the deliberate intention of his or
9 her employer to produce such injury or death, the employee or the employee's
10 dependent as herein defined shall receive the amount provided in this chapter in a
11 lump sum to be used, if desired, to prosecute the employer. The dependents may
12 bring suit against the employer for any amount they desire. If injury or death results
13 to an employee through the deliberate intention of his or her employer to produce
14 such injury or death, the employee or the employee's dependents may take under
15 this chapter, or in lieu thereof, have a cause of action at law against the employer as
16 if this chapter had not been passed, for such damage so sustained by the employee,
17 his or her dependents or personal representatives as is recoverable at law. If a suit is
18 brought under this subsection, all right to compensation under this chapter shall
19 thereby be waived as to all persons. If a claim is made for the payment of
20 compensation or any other benefit provided by this chapter, all rights to sue the
