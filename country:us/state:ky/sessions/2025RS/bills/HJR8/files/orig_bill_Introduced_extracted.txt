2 Boone County.
3 WHEREAS, President Donald J. Trump was elected to be President of the United
4 States on November 8, 2016; and
5 WHEREAS, President Trump made great improvements to the United States during
6 his time as President; and
7 WHEREAS, one such example of President Trump's commitment to the well-being
8 of American people is President Trump's signing of two executive orders, two
9 proclamations, and eight bills related to human trafficking, including Executive Order
10 13903 on Combating Human Trafficking and Online Child Exploitation, which, among
11 other things, designated an employee position at the White House dedicated solely to
12 work on issues related to combating human trafficking; and
13 WHEREAS, President Trump also succeeded in bringing troops home from
14 overseas, ending his term with about 2,500 soldiers in Afghanistan, down from 8,400 in
15 January of 2017, and 98,000 in the Afghanistan War's peak in 2011; and
16 WHEREAS, President Trump used his influence as President to speak out against

20 outside of the country had no place in a bill designed to ease the suffering of American
21 citizens in the midst of a global pandemic, requesting that excessive foreign aid be
22 reduced in every budget proposal, and reducing foreign aid overall and keeping that
23 money in the United States, such as reducing foreign aid to China by $32 million in 2020;
24 and
25 WHEREAS, President Trump moved the United States embassy from Tel Aviv to
26 Jerusalem and has brokered peace deals normalizing the relations of several regional

5 Scientific, and Cultural Organization in 2017, the United Nations Human Rights Council
6 in 2018, and the World Health Organization in 2020, as well as from the United Nations
7 Arms Trade Treaty; and

9 the American people and the resilience of American government; and

12 two non-consecutive terms in office; and
13 WHEREAS, for his accomplishments in the past and for all the things he will do for
14 our country over the next four years, President Trump is worthy of tangible recognition
