UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS HB 291/GA
1 AN ACT relating to crimes and punishments.
2 WHEREAS, it is the intent of this Commonwealth to promote, strengthen, and
3 encourage family life for the protection and care of children and to maintain the family
4 unit with an emphasis on the parent-child relationship; and
5 WHEREAS, the Commonwealth recognizes that parental incarceration is classified
6 as an adverse childhood experience. Multiple peer-reviewed studies demonstrate that
7 adverse childhood experiences contribute to poor mental and physical health outcomes
8 for children and increase the likelihood that a child will become involved with the
9 criminal justice system; and
10 WHEREAS, to prevent unnecessary harm to children caused by the separation from
11 a parent during incarceration, alternative sentences should be considered before a parent
12 is sentenced to a term of imprisonment; and
13 WHEREAS, this Act shall be interpreted to promote the family unit with an
14 emphasis on maintaining the parent-child relationship by providing mental health
15 treatment, substance use disorder treatment, parenting classes, educational or vocational
16 training, or other services, as appropriate, while ensuring public safety, reducing
17 recidivism, and making any victim whole through restitution;
18 NOW, THEREFORE,
19 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
20 SECTION 1. A NEW SECTION OF KRS CHAPTER 533 IS CREATED TO
