1 (7)[(6)] Any qualified domestic relations order submitted to the retirement system
2 shall specify the dollar amount or percentage amount of the participant's benefit to
3 be paid to the alternate payee. In calculating the amount to be paid to the alternate

5 161.620 shall be divided between the participant and alternate payee in a qualified
6 domestic relations order as follows:
7 (a) If the order specifies the alternate payee is to receive a percentage of the

10 the total benefit each is receiving upon the participant's retirement or upon the
11 date the order is approved by the retirement system, whichever is later; or
12 (b) If the order specifies that the alternate payee is to receive a set dollar amount
13 of the participant's benefit, then the order shall specify that:
14 1. The cost of living adjustment shall be divided between the participant
15 and the alternate payee based upon the percentage of the total benefit
16 each is receiving upon the participant's retirement or upon the date the
17 order is approved by the retirement system, whichever is later; or
18 2. The alternate payee shall receive no cost of living adjustment.
19 If the order does not specify the division of the cost of living adjustment as
20 required by this paragraph, then no cost of living adjustment shall be payable
21 to the alternate payee. If no cost of living adjustment is provided to the
22 alternate payee, then the participant shall receive the full cost of living
23 adjustment he or she would have received if the order had not been applied to
24 the participant's account.
25 (12)[(11)] Except in cases involving child support payments, the retirement system may
26 charge reasonable and necessary fees and expenses to the recipient and the alternate
27 payee of a qualified domestic relations order for the administration of the qualified
Page 57 of 64

7 (c) Equally shared by the participant and alternate payee.
8 (13)[(12)] The retirement system shall honor a qualified domestic relations order issued
9 prior to July 15, 2010, for prospective benefit payments if the order or an amended
10 version of the order meets the requirements established by this section and the
11 administrative regulations promulgated by the retirement system. The order shall
12 not apply to benefit payments issued by the retirement system prior to the date the
13 order was approved by the retirement system.
14 ïƒ¢Section 12. KRS 21.420 is amended to read as follows:
15 (1) After the death of a member who began participating in the Judicial Retirement
16 Plan prior to January 1, 2014, who at the time of his or her death was receiving a
17 service retirement allowance (other than an actuarially reduced allowance under
18 subsection (3) of KRS 21.400), or was receiving a disability retirement allowance,
19 his or her surviving spouse is entitled to receive during his or her lifetime a
20 monthly allowance equal to one-half (1/2) of that he or she was receiving.
21 (2) (a) If a member who began participating in the Judicial Retirement Plan prior to
22 January 1, 2014, dies before retirement and before reaching normal retirement
23 age, without regard to length of service, his or her surviving spouse is entitled
24 to receive during his or her lifetime a monthly allowance equal to one-half
25 (1/2) of the monthly allowance the member would have received commencing
26 at his or her normal retirement date if he or she had continued in service until
27 that date and had then retired, computed however on the basis of his or her
Page 58 of 64

1 final compensation at time of death.
2 (b) If a member who began participating in the Judicial Retirement Plan prior to
3 January 1, 2014, dies before retirement and after reaching normal retirement
4 age, his or her surviving spouse is entitled to receive during his or her
5 lifetime a monthly allowance equal to one-half (1/2) of the monthly allowance
6 the member would have been entitled to, on the basis of his or her years of
7 service, had he or she retired on the date of his death.
8 (3) If a member who began participating in the Judicial Retirement Plan prior to
9 January 1, 2014, dies after retirement and was at the time of his or her death
10 receiving an actuarially reduced allowance under subsection (3) of KRS 21.400, or
11 was not at the time of his or her death receiving a retirement allowance but had
12 acquired the vested right under subsection (2) of KRS 21.400 to have received an
13 allowance upon reaching normal retirement age, his or her surviving spouse is
14 entitled to receive during his or her lifetime a monthly allowance equal to one-half
15 (1/2) of the monthly allowance the member would have received when he or she
16 reached normal retirement age.
17 (4) A member, or a retiree who began participating in the plan prior to January 1, 2014,
18 who has not commenced drawing retirement benefits pursuant to KRS 21.400, and
19 who dies without a spouse or eligible children entitled to survivor's benefits, may
20 designate a beneficiary who shall receive the accumulated contributions of the

1 member's participation date, shall be paid to the member's estate.
2 (5) A member who began participating in the plan prior to January 1, 2014, who
3 commences drawing retirement benefits pursuant to KRS 21.400 or 21.410, and
4 who dies without a spouse or eligible children entitled to survivor's benefits and
5 before the benefits received by the member equal the accumulated contributions of
6 the member, may designate a beneficiary who shall receive the balance of the
7 accumulated contributions of the member. A member who began participating in
8 the plan on or after January 1, 2014, who commences drawing retirement benefits
9 pursuant to KRS 21.402 or 21.410, and who dies without a spouse or eligible
10 children entitled to survivor's benefits and before the benefits received by the
11 member equal the accumulated account balance of the member, may designate a
12 beneficiary who shall receive the balance of the accumulated account balance of the
13 member. A trust, including a special needs trust, may be designated as a
14 beneficiary. Any benefits received shall be deducted from the accumulated
15 contributions or accumulated account balance. Absent a designation by the member,
16 the balance of the accumulated contributions or accumulated account balance, as
17 applicable based upon the member's participation date, shall be paid to the
18 member's estate.
19 (6) A member who begins participating in the Judicial Retirement Plan prior to January
20 1, 2014, may designate a beneficiary who shall receive the balance of the

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS SB 58/GA
1 allowance which shall be actuarially equivalent to the amount of retirement
2 allowance otherwise payable to the member and the member's spouse. If the
3 member dies after retirement, the option chosen shall prevail over the provisions of
4 subsections (1) and (3) of this section. If the member dies prior to retirement, the
5 option chosen shall prevail over the provisions of subsection (2) of this section. The
6 options shall include:
7 (a) Survivorship one hundred percent (100%). The member may elect to receive a
8 decreased retirement allowance during the member's lifetime and have the
9 retirement allowance continued after death to the spouse during the lifetime of
10 the spouse.
11 (b) Survivorship sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%). The member may
12 elect to receive a decreased retirement allowance during the member's lifetime
13 and have two-thirds (2/3) of the retirement allowance continue after death to

19 who retired from July 15, 1994, to July 15, 1998, shall have a one-time opportunity
20 to select an optional retirement allowance. The election by the recipient shall be
21 prior to August 1, 1998, at which time the new benefit shall commence. The option
22 chosen shall prevail, subsections (1), (2), and (3) of this section notwithstanding.
23 (8) For a member who begins participating in the Judicial Retirement Plan on or after
24 January 1, 2014:
25 (a) If the member dies prior to drawing a retirement allowance, then the surviving
26 spouse may elect to:
27 1. Take a refund of the member's accumulated account balance or
Page 61 of 64
SB005810.100 - 938 - XXXX 3/5/2025 3:59 PM GA

1 accumulated contributions as provided by KRS 21.402; or
2 2. If the member had at least five (5) years of service in the plan at the time
3 of his or her death, have the member's accumulated account balance
4 annuitized into a monthly benefit payable for life that is equal to the

6 prior to his or her date of death and elected to receive benefits payable
7 under the survivorship one hundred percent (100%) option as provided
8 by paragraph (b)1. of this subsection.
9 In lieu of the benefits provided by this paragraph to the surviving spouse, the
10 member may elect to have the benefits payable under this paragraph paid to
11 an individual dependent child by completing the forms provided prescribed by
12 the Judicial Form Retirement System. If no surviving spouse or dependent
13 children are eligible to receive benefits, then the provisions of subsection (4)
14 of this section shall apply to the member.
15 (b) If a member dies on or after the date the member begins drawing a retirement
16 allowance, the benefits payable to the surviving spouse shall be based upon
17 whether or not the member elects prior to retirement to receive an optional
18 retirement allowance. The election shall be in writing on the forms prescribed
19 by the Judicial Form Retirement System and shall be actuarially equivalent to
20 the amount of retirement allowance otherwise payable to the member. The
21 optional retirement allowances shall include:
22 1. Survivorship one hundred percent (100%). The member may elect to
23 receive a decreased retirement allowance during the member's lifetime
24 and have the retirement allowance continued after death to the spouse

3 3. Survivorship fifty percent (50%). The member may elect to receive a
4 decreased retirement allowance during the member's lifetime and have
5 one-half (1/2) of the retirement allowance continue after death to the

7 In lieu of the benefits provided by this paragraph to the surviving spouse, the
8 member may elect prior to retirement to have the benefits payable under this
9 paragraph paid to an individual dependent child or to a special needs trust by
10 completing the forms provided by the Judicial Form Retirement System. If no
11 surviving spouse or dependent children are eligible to receive benefits, then
12 the provisions of subsection (5) of this section shall apply to the member.

17 U.S.C. sec. 1396p(d)(4)(A).

20 spouse was receiving or is entitled to receive may be paid to a special needs
21 trust for the benefit of the surviving spouse.
22 ïƒ¢Section 13. KRS 21.425 is amended to read as follows:
23 (1) In any circumstances in which a surviving spouse would be entitled to any

25 spouse subsequently dies, and there is a surviving child or children of the member
26 under the age of twenty-one (21), or there is a disabled child or children, the

Page 63 of 64
SB005810.100 - 938 - XXXX 3/5/2025 3:59 PM GA
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS SB 58/GA
1 shall be continued, as follows:

4 (11)[(10)] The cost of living adjustment provided to the participant pursuant to KRS
5 161.620 shall be divided between the participant and alternate payee in a qualified
6 domestic relations order as follows:
7 (a) If the order specifies the alternate payee is to receive a percentage of the
8 participant's benefit, then the cost of living adjustment shall be divided
9 between the participant and the alternate payee based upon the percentage of
10 the total benefit each is receiving upon the participant's retirement or upon the
11 date the order is approved by the retirement system, whichever is later; or
12 (b) If the order specifies that the alternate payee is to receive a set dollar amount
13 of the participant's benefit, then the order shall specify that:
14 1. The cost of living adjustment shall be divided between the participant
15 and the alternate payee based upon the percentage of the total benefit
16 each is receiving upon the participant's retirement or upon the date the
17 order is approved by the retirement system, whichever is later; or
18 2. The alternate payee shall receive no cost of living adjustment.
19 If the order does not specify the division of the cost of living adjustment as
20 required by this paragraph, then no cost of living adjustment shall be payable
21 to the alternate payee. If no cost of living adjustment is provided to the
22 alternate payee, then the participant shall receive the full cost of living
23 adjustment he or she would have received if the order had not been applied to
24 the participant's account.
25 (12)[(11)] Except in cases involving child support payments, the retirement system may

7 (c) Equally shared by the participant and alternate payee.
8 (13)[(12)] The retirement system shall honor a qualified domestic relations order issued

10 version of the order meets the requirements established by this section and the
11 administrative regulations promulgated by the retirement system. The order shall
12 not apply to benefit payments issued by the retirement system prior to the date the
13 order was approved by the retirement system.
14 ïƒ¢Section 12. KRS 21.420 is amended to read as follows:
15 (1) After the death of a member who began participating in the Judicial Retirement
16 Plan prior to January 1, 2014, who at the time of his or her death was receiving a
17 service retirement allowance (other than an actuarially reduced allowance under
18 subsection (3) of KRS 21.400), or was receiving a disability retirement allowance,
19 his or her surviving spouse is entitled to receive during his or her lifetime a
20 monthly allowance equal to one-half (1/2) of that he or she was receiving.
21 (2) (a) If a member who began participating in the Judicial Retirement Plan prior to
22 January 1, 2014, dies before retirement and before reaching normal retirement
23 age, without regard to length of service, his or her surviving spouse is entitled
24 to receive during his or her lifetime a monthly allowance equal to one-half
25 (1/2) of the monthly allowance the member would have received commencing
26 at his or her normal retirement date if he or she had continued in service until
27 that date and had then retired, computed however on the basis of his or her
Page 58 of 64

1 final compensation at time of death.
2 (b) If a member who began participating in the Judicial Retirement Plan prior to
3 January 1, 2014, dies before retirement and after reaching normal retirement
4 age, his or her surviving spouse is entitled to receive during his or her
5 lifetime a monthly allowance equal to one-half (1/2) of the monthly allowance
6 the member would have been entitled to, on the basis of his or her years of
7 service, had he or she retired on the date of his death.
8 (3) If a member who began participating in the Judicial Retirement Plan prior to
9 January 1, 2014, dies after retirement and was at the time of his or her death
10 receiving an actuarially reduced allowance under subsection (3) of KRS 21.400, or
11 was not at the time of his or her death receiving a retirement allowance but had
12 acquired the vested right under subsection (2) of KRS 21.400 to have received an
13 allowance upon reaching normal retirement age, his or her surviving spouse is
14 entitled to receive during his or her lifetime a monthly allowance equal to one-half
15 (1/2) of the monthly allowance the member would have received when he or she
16 reached normal retirement age.
17 (4) A member, or a retiree who began participating in the plan prior to January 1, 2014,
18 who has not commenced drawing retirement benefits pursuant to KRS 21.400, and
19 who dies without a spouse or eligible children entitled to survivor's benefits, may
20 designate a beneficiary who shall receive the accumulated contributions of the
21 member. A member, or a retiree who began participating in the plan on or after
22 January 1, 2014, who has not commenced drawing retirement benefits pursuant to
23 KRS 21.402, who dies without a spouse or eligible children entitled to survivor's
24 benefits, may designate a beneficiary who shall receive the accumulated account

27 contributions or accumulated account balance, as applicable based upon the
Page 59 of 64
SB005810.100 - 938 - XXXX 3/5/2025 3:59 PM GA

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS SB 58/GA
1 member's participation date, shall be paid to the member's estate.
2 (5) A member who began participating in the plan prior to January 1, 2014, who
3 commences drawing retirement benefits pursuant to KRS 21.400 or 21.410, and
4 who dies without a spouse or eligible children entitled to survivor's benefits and
5 before the benefits received by the member equal the accumulated contributions of
6 the member, may designate a beneficiary who shall receive the balance of the
7 accumulated contributions of the member. A member who began participating in
8 the plan on or after January 1, 2014, who commences drawing retirement benefits
9 pursuant to KRS 21.402 or 21.410, and who dies without a spouse or eligible
10 children entitled to survivor's benefits and before the benefits received by the
11 member equal the accumulated account balance of the member, may designate a
12 beneficiary who shall receive the balance of the accumulated account balance of the
13 member. A trust, including a special needs trust, may be designated as a
14 beneficiary. Any benefits received shall be deducted from the accumulated
15 contributions or accumulated account balance. Absent a designation by the member,
16 the balance of the accumulated contributions or accumulated account balance, as
17 applicable based upon the member's participation date, shall be paid to the
18 member's estate.
19 (6) A member who begins participating in the Judicial Retirement Plan prior to January
20 1, 2014, may designate a beneficiary who shall receive the balance of the
21 accumulated contributions of the member, in the event survivor's benefits are being
22 paid pursuant to subsection (1), (2), or (3) of this section, and the survivor dies prior
23 to receiving benefits equal to the member's contributions. In this event, the
24 provisions of subsection (5) of this section shall apply as to offset and payment.
25 (7) A member who begins participating in the Judicial Retirement Plan prior to January

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS SB 58/GA
1 allowance which shall be actuarially equivalent to the amount of retirement
2 allowance otherwise payable to the member and the member's spouse. If the
3 member dies after retirement, the option chosen shall prevail over the provisions of
4 subsections (1) and (3) of this section. If the member dies prior to retirement, the
5 option chosen shall prevail over the provisions of subsection (2) of this section. The
6 options shall include:
7 (a) Survivorship one hundred percent (100%). The member may elect to receive a
8 decreased retirement allowance during the member's lifetime and have the
9 retirement allowance continued after death to the spouse during the lifetime of
10 the spouse.
11 (b) Survivorship sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%). The member may
12 elect to receive a decreased retirement allowance during the member's lifetime
13 and have two-thirds (2/3) of the retirement allowance continue after death to
14 the spouse during the lifetime of the spouse.
15 If a retiree, living or deceased, chose either of the optional retirement benefit
16 allowances specified in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this subsection from July 15, 1994,
17 to July 15, 1998, the optional allowance shall be adjusted accordingly, and the new
18 benefit shall commence August 1, 1998. Each recipient of benefits from the plan,
19 who retired from July 15, 1994, to July 15, 1998, shall have a one-time opportunity
20 to select an optional retirement allowance. The election by the recipient shall be
21 prior to August 1, 1998, at which time the new benefit shall commence. The option
22 chosen shall prevail, subsections (1), (2), and (3) of this section notwithstanding.
23 (8) For a member who begins participating in the Judicial Retirement Plan on or after
24 January 1, 2014:
25 (a) If the member dies prior to drawing a retirement allowance, then the surviving
26 spouse may elect to:
27 1. Take a refund of the member's accumulated account balance or
Page 61 of 64
SB005810.100 - 938 - XXXX 3/5/2025 3:59 PM GA

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS SB 58/GA
1 accumulated contributions as provided by KRS 21.402; or
2 2. If the member had at least five (5) years of service in the plan at the time
3 of his or her death, have the member's accumulated account balance
4 annuitized into a monthly benefit payable for life that is equal to the
5 benefit that would have been paid had the member retired immediately
6 prior to his or her date of death and elected to receive benefits payable
7 under the survivorship one hundred percent (100%) option as provided
8 by paragraph (b)1. of this subsection.
9 In lieu of the benefits provided by this paragraph to the surviving spouse, the
10 member may elect to have the benefits payable under this paragraph paid to
11 an individual dependent child by completing the forms provided prescribed by
12 the Judicial Form Retirement System. If no surviving spouse or dependent
13 children are eligible to receive benefits, then the provisions of subsection (4)
14 of this section shall apply to the member.
15 (b) If a member dies on or after the date the member begins drawing a retirement
16 allowance, the benefits payable to the surviving spouse shall be based upon
17 whether or not the member elects prior to retirement to receive an optional
18 retirement allowance. The election shall be in writing on the forms prescribed
19 by the Judicial Form Retirement System and shall be actuarially equivalent to
20 the amount of retirement allowance otherwise payable to the member. The
21 optional retirement allowances shall include:
22 1. Survivorship one hundred percent (100%). The member may elect to
23 receive a decreased retirement allowance during the member's lifetime
24 and have the retirement allowance continued after death to the spouse
25 during the lifetime of the spouse;
26 2. Survivorship sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%). The member
27 may elect to receive a decreased retirement allowance during the
Page 62 of 64
SB005810.100 - 938 - XXXX 3/5/2025 3:59 PM GA

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS SB 58/GA
1 member's lifetime and have two-thirds (2/3) of the retirement allowance
2 continue after death to the spouse during the lifetime of the spouse; or
3 3. Survivorship fifty percent (50%). The member may elect to receive a
4 decreased retirement allowance during the member's lifetime and have
5 one-half (1/2) of the retirement allowance continue after death to the
6 spouse during the lifetime of the spouse.
7 In lieu of the benefits provided by this paragraph to the surviving spouse, the
8 member may elect prior to retirement to have the benefits payable under this
9 paragraph paid to an individual dependent child or to a special needs trust by
10 completing the forms provided by the Judicial Form Retirement System. If no
11 surviving spouse or dependent children are eligible to receive benefits, then
12 the provisions of subsection (5) of this section shall apply to the member.
13 (c) For purposes of this section a "dependent child" shall mean a child who is less
14 than twenty-one (21) years of age or a disabled child who is eligible for Social
15 Security disability benefits.
16 (9) (a) As used in this section, "special needs trust" means a trust described in 42
17 U.S.C. sec. 1396p(d)(4)(A).
18 (b) In any circumstances in which a surviving spouse would be entitled to any
19 allowance under this section, the monthly allowance that the surviving
20 spouse was receiving or is entitled to receive may be paid to a special needs
21 trust for the benefit of the surviving spouse.
22 ïƒ¢Section 13. KRS 21.425 is amended to read as follows:
23 (1) In any circumstances in which a surviving spouse would be entitled to any
24 allowance under KRS 21.420, but there is no surviving spouse or the surviving
25 spouse subsequently dies, and there is a surviving child or children of the member
26 under the age of twenty-one (21), or there is a disabled child or children, the
27 monthly allowance that the surviving spouse would have received or was receiving
Page 63 of 64
SB005810.100 - 938 - XXXX 3/5/2025 3:59 PM GA

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS SB 58/GA
1 shall be continued, as follows:
2 (a) If the member does not have a disabled child or children, the benefit shall
3 continue until there are no children remaining under the age of twenty-one
4 (21); or
5 (b) If the member has a disabled child or children, the benefit shall continue until
6 the death of the last remaining disabled child.
7 (2) A member may designate his or her child or children under the age of twenty-one
8 (21), or his or her disabled child or children, or a special needs trust as defined by
9 subsection (9) of Section 12 of this Act for the benefit of the disabled child, to
10 receive the death benefit payable under KRS 21.420 instead of his or her spouse, or
11 he or she may designate that his or her spouse shall receive a percentage of the
12 death benefit, and his or her child or children under the age of twenty-one (21), or
13 his or her disabled child or children, or a special needs trust as defined by
14 subsection (9) of Section 12 of this Act for the benefit of a disabled child, shall
15 receive the remainder. The member making such a choice shall designate his or her
16 beneficiary or beneficiaries in writing to the manager of the Judicial Form
17 Retirement System on a form provided by the manager.
18 (3) For purposes of this section, "disabled" means an individual determined by the
19 Social Security Administration to be entitled to total disability benefits.
