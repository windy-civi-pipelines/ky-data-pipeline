4 WHEREAS, the Gun Control Act of 1968 currently prohibits the possession of

8 medicinal purposes; and

10 chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting; and
11 WHEREAS, the majority of states have enacted laws permitting the legal use of
12 cannabis for medicinal purposes; and

14 Session, which established a medical cannabis program in the Commonwealth that came
15 into effect January 1, 2025; and

17 laws has created confusion, inconsistency, and unnecessary legal risks for individuals

20 accessing essential medical care and exercising their rights under the Second
21 Amendment;
