1 AN ACT relating to coverage for hearing loss.
2 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
3 Section 1. KRS 304.17A-132 is amended to read as follows:
4 (1) As used in this section:
5 (a) "Cost sharing":
6 1. Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph 2. of this paragraph,
7 means the cost to an insured under a health benefit plan according to
8 any copayment, coinsurance, deductible, or other out-of-pocket
9 expense requirements imposed by the plan; and
10 2. Does not include a coverage limit authorized under this section;
11 (b) "Hearing aid" means any wearable, nondisposable instrument or device
12 designed to aid or compensate for impaired human hearing and any parts,
13 attachments, or accessories, including earmolds, but excluding batteries and
14 cords; and
15 (c)[(b)] "Related services" means those services necessary to assess, select, and
16 appropriately adjust or fit the hearing aid to ensure optimal performance.
17 (2) Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section:
18 (a) All[A] health benefit plans[plan] shall provide coverage for hearing aids and
19 related services in accordance with this section and administrative
20 regulations promulgated under this section for hearing loss that is
21 documented by a physician or audiologist;[, subject to all applicable
22 copayments, coinsurance, deductibles, and out-of-pocket limits, for the full
23 cost of one (1) hearing aid per hearing-impaired ear up to one thousand four
24 hundred dollars ($1,400) every thirty-six (36) months for hearing aids for
25 insured individuals under eighteen (18) years of age and all related services
26 which shall be prescribed by an audiologist licensed under KRS Chapter
27 334A and dispensed by an audiologist or hearing instrument specialist

1 licensed under KRS Chapter 334.]
2 (b) Subject to paragraph (c) of this subsection, the coverage required under this
3 subsection shall include coverage, without cost sharing, for one (1) hearing
4 aid per hard-of-hearing or deaf ear:
5 1. For:
6 a. Children regardless of the degree of hearing loss; and
7 b. Adults with severe to profound hearing loss; and
8 2. That is not less than the cost of a reasonable and customary hearing
9 aid; and
10 (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this subsection, the coverage required
11 under this subsection shall not be less than the coverage that was required
12 under this section prior to the effective date of this Act.
13 (3) (a) The commissioner shall:
14 1. Promulgate an administrative regulation in accordance with KRS
15 Chapter 13A to establish a minimum coverage amount per hearing aid
16 for the coverage required under subsection (2) of this section; and
17 2. Annually review the minimum coverage amount established under
18 subparagraph 1. of this paragraph to ensure that the coverage
19 requirements of subsection (2) of this section are satisfied.
20 (b) If the commissioner determines that an adjustment in the minimum
21 coverage amount is necessary to satisfy the coverage requirements of
22 subsection (2) of this section, the commissioner shall amend the
23 administrative regulation to make the adjustment.
24 (4) An[The] insured may choose a higher priced hearing aid and may pay the
25 difference in cost above the minimum coverage amount established pursuant to
26 subsection (3) of this section[one thousand four hundred dollar ($1,400) limit as
27 provided in this section] without any financial or contractual penalty to the insured

1 or to the provider of the hearing aid.
2 (5) If the application of any requirement of subsection (2) of this section would be
3 the sole cause of a health benefit plan's failure to qualify as a Health Savings
4 Account-qualified High Deductible Health Plan under 26 U.S.C. sec. 223, as
5 amended, then the requirement shall not apply to that health benefit plan until
6 the minimum deductible under 26 U.S.C. sec. 223, as amended, is satisfied.
7 [(3) A health benefit plan shall not be required to pay a claim filed by its insured for
8 payment of the cost of a hearing aid under the coverage required by subsection (2)
9 of this section if less than three (3) years prior to the date of the claim its insured
10 filed a claim for payment of the cost of a hearing aid under the required coverage
