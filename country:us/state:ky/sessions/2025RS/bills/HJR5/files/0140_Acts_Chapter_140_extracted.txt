days of the effective date of this Resolution, erect the appropriate signage.
Section 37. The Transportation Cabinet shall designate United States Route 23, from mile marker 27 to
mile marker 28 in Lawrence County, as the "Trooper Chris Carter Memorial Highway" and shall, within 30 days of
the effective date of this Resolution, erect the appropriate signage.
Section 38. The Transportation Cabinet shall designate the following route as the Heartland Parkway and
shall within thirty (30) days erect appropriate signage at each end of the route and at each county line in between:
(1) Kentucky Route 55 in Adair, Taylor, and Marion Counties; and

States Route 150.
Section 39. The General Assembly hereby urges the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet to petition the
American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials to designate as United States Highway 111
along the following routes:
(1) Kentucky Route 461 from United States Highway 25 at Mount Vernon to the KY 80 interchange at
Shopville;
(2) Kentucky Route 80 from the Kentucky Route 461 intersection to the Kentucky Route 914 intersection;
(3) Kentucky Route 914 (the Somerset Bypass) from the Kentucky Route 80 intersection to the Kentucky
Route 1247 intersection;
(4) Kentucky Route 1247 from the Kentucky Route 914 intersection in Ferguson to the Kentucky Route
90/United States Highway 27 interchange at Burnside;
(5) Kentucky Route 90 from the United States Highway 27/Kentucky Route 1247 interchange through
Monticello to the United States Highway 127 intersection;
(6) United States Highway 127 from the Kentucky Route 90 intersection through Albany to the Tennessee
Route 111 intersection at Static;
(7) Tennessee Route 111 for its entire length, to United States Highway 27 at Soddy-Daisy;
(8) United States Highway 27 from the Tennessee Route 111 intersection to the Tennessee Route 153
intersection; and
(9) Tennessee Route 153 from the United States Highway 27 intersection to the United States Highway
11/64 intersection just before Interstate 75.
Section 40. The proposed petition in Section 39 of this Act includes United States Highway 27 and
Tennessee Route 153 in order to follow AASHTO's general principle that three-digit federal routes should be spur
routes of a two-digit federal route, with its number incorporated as the last two digits of the spur route. If AASHTO
does not deem this necessary, and Tennessee does not wish to extend United States Highway 111 to United States
Highway 11, the last two segments in subsections (8) and (9) of Section 39 of this Act may be considered optional.
Section 41. Except in the case of Kentucky Route 461, the proposal in Section 39 of this Act does not call
for elimination of existing route numbers. United States Highway 111 could be co-signed with the segments of
Kentucky Routes 80, 914, 1247, and 90, and United States Highway 127, depending on the decisions of state officials
in consultation with local officials.
Section 42. The Transportation Cabinet shall designate the portion of Kentucky Route 914 in Pulaski
County, from its intersection with Kentucky Route 1577 to its intersection with Kentucky Route 1247, as the "Faye
Cain Sears Memorial Highway" and shall, within 30 days of the effective date of this Resolution, erect appropriate
signage denoting this designation.
Signed by Governor April 1, 2025.
