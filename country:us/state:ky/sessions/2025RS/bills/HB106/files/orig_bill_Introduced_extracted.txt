15 associated with the device, including administrative and operating costs, shall
16 be paid by the defendant. If the court determines that the defendant is
17 indigent, and a person, county, or other organization has not agreed to pay the
18 costs for the defendant in an attempt to reduce incarceration expenses and
19 increase public safety, the court shall consider other conditions of probation or
20 conditional discharge provided for in this section;
21 (n) During all or part of the period of probation or conditional discharge,
22 participate in a global positioning monitoring system program operated by a
23 county pursuant to KRS 67.372 and 67.374 under the same terms and
24 conditions as provided in KRS 431.517; or
25 (o) Participate in a specific evidence-based program designed to reduce violence.
26 (3) When imposing a sentence of probation or conditional discharge in a case where a
27 victim of a crime has suffered monetary damage as a result of the crime due to his
Page 28 of 34

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 920
1 or her property having been converted, stolen, or unlawfully obtained, or its value
2 substantially decreased as a result of the crime, or where the victim suffered actual
3 medical expenses, direct out-of-pocket losses, or loss of earning as a direct result of
4 the crime, or where the victim incurred expenses in relocating for the purpose of the
5 victim's safety or the safety of a member of the victim's household, or if as a direct
6 result of the crime the victim incurred medical expenses that were paid by the
7 Cabinet for Health and Family Services, the Crime Victims Compensation Board,
8 or any other governmental entity, the court shall order the defendant to make
9 restitution in addition to any other penalty provided for the commission of the
10 offense. Payment of restitution to the victim shall have priority over payment of
11 restitution to any government agency. Restitution shall be ordered in the full
12 amount of the damages, unless the damages exceed one hundred thousand dollars
13 ($100,000) or twice the amount of the gain from the commission of the offense,
14 whichever is greater, in which case the higher of these two (2) amounts shall be
15 awarded. The court may, in lieu of ordering monetary restitution, order the
16 defendant to make restitution by working for or on behalf of the victim. The court
17 shall determine the number of hours of work necessary by applying the then-
18 prevailing federal minimum wage to the total amount of monetary damage caused
19 by or incidental to the commission of the crime. The court may, with the consent of
20 the agency, order the defendant to work as specified in KRS 533.070. Any work
21 ordered pursuant to this section shall not be deemed employment for any purpose,
22 nor shall the person performing the work be deemed an employee for any purpose.
23 Where there is more than one (1) defendant or more than one (1) victim, restitution
24 may be apportioned. Restitution shall be subject to the following additional terms
25 and conditions:
26 (a) Where property which is unlawfully in the possession of the defendant is in
27 substantially undamaged condition from its condition at the time of the taking,
Page 29 of 34
XXXX 12/26/2024 10:31 AM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 920
1 return of the property shall be ordered in lieu of monetary restitution;
2 (b) The circuit clerk shall assess an additional fee of five percent (5%) to defray
3 the administrative costs of collection of payments or property. This fee shall
4 be paid by the defendant and shall inure to a trust and agency account which
5 shall not lapse and which shall be used to hire additional deputy clerks and
6 office personnel or increase deputy clerk or office personnel salaries, or
7 combination thereof;
8 (c) When a defendant fails to make restitution ordered to be paid through the
9 circuit clerk or a court-authorized program run by the county attorney or the
10 Commonwealth's attorney, the circuit clerk or court-authorized program shall
11 notify the court; and
12 (d) An order of restitution shall not preclude the owner of property or the victim
13 who suffered personal physical or mental injury or out-of-pocket loss of
14 earnings or support or other damages from proceeding in a civil action to
15 recover damages from the defendant. A civil verdict shall be reduced by the
16 amount paid under the criminal restitution order.
17 (4) When requiring fees for controlled substances or alcohol tests, or other fees and
18 payments authorized by this section or other statute, except restitution, to be paid by
19 the defendant, the court shall not order the payments to be paid through the circuit
20 clerk.
21 (5) When a defendant is sentenced to probation or conditional discharge, he or she shall
22 be given a written statement explicitly setting forth the conditions under which he
23 or she is being released.
24 (6) When imposing a sentence of probation or conditional discharge, the court, in
25 addition to conditions imposed under this section, may require as a condition of the
26 sentence that the defendant submit to a period of imprisonment in the county jail or
27 to a period of home incarceration at whatever time or intervals, consecutive or
Page 30 of 34
XXXX 12/26/2024 10:31 AM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 920
1 nonconsecutive, the court shall determine. The time actually spent in confinement
2 or home incarceration pursuant to this provision shall not exceed twelve (12)
3 months or the maximum term of imprisonment assessed pursuant to KRS Chapter
4 532, whichever is the shorter. Time spent in confinement or home incarceration
5 under this subsection shall be credited against the maximum term of imprisonment
6 assessed for the defendant pursuant to KRS Chapter 532, if probation or conditional
7 discharge is revoked and the defendant is sentenced to imprisonment. Any
8 prohibitions against probation, shock probation, or conditional discharge under
9 KRS 533.060(2) or 532.045 shall not apply to persons convicted of a misdemeanor
10 or Class D felony and sentenced to a period of confinement or home incarceration
11 under this section.
12 Section 9. KRS 138.872 is amended to read as follows:
13 (1) A tax is hereby levied on each offender engaging in a taxable activity in this state.
14 The tax shall be paid at the following rates:
15 (a) One thousand dollars ($1,000) per plant, whether growing or detached from
16 the soil, on each cannabis[marijuana] plant with foliation which exceeds a
17 personal use quantity of cannabis as defined in Section 2 of this Act;
18 (b) Three dollars and fifty cents ($3.50) on each gram, or portion thereof, of
19 cannabis[marijuana] which has been detached from the plant on which it
20 grew and which exceeds a personal use quantity of cannabis as defined in
21 Section 2 of this Act;
22 (c) Two hundred dollars ($200) on each gram, or portion thereof, of controlled
23 substances; and
24 (d) Two thousand dollars ($2,000) on each fifty (50) dosage units, or portion
25 thereof, of a controlled substance that is not sold by weight.
26 (2) For the purpose of calculating the tax levied pursuant to subsections (1)(b), (1)(c),
27 and (1)(d) of this section, the quantity shall be measured by the weight of the
Page 31 of 34
XXXX 12/26/2024 10:31 AM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 920
1 cannabis[marijuana] or controlled substance, whether pure, impure, or diluted, or
2 by dosage units when a controlled substance is not sold by weight.
3 (3) An offender lawfully engaged in a taxable activity shall be exempt from the tax
4 imposed by this section if the offender is not in violation of any law which
5 authorizes him or her to engage in the activity.
6 SECTION 10. A NEW SECTION OF KRS CHAPTER 431 IS CREATED TO
7 READ AS FOLLOWS:
8 (1) As used in this section:
9 (a) "Cannabis accessory" has the same meaning as in Section 2 of this Act;
10 (b) "Eligible conviction" means any criminal conviction for a violation of
11 Section 3 of this Act, subsection (2) of Section 4 of this Act, subsection (2)
12 of Section 5 of this Act, or Section 6 of this Act, or a conviction for an
13 offense prior to July 14, 1992, for possession, cultivation, or trafficking of
14 marijuana which was punishable by not more than five (5) years'
15 incarceration;
16 (c) "Expungeable conviction" means any eligible conviction for which the
17 available record does not indicate that the offense involved a quantity of
18 marijuana in excess of the personal use quantity of cannabis, or, for a
19 conviction pursuant to Section 6 of this Act, the record does not indicate
20 that the offense involved drug paraphernalia other than cannabis
21 accessories; and
22 (d) "Personal use quantity of cannabis" has the same meaning as in Section 2
23 of this Act.
24 (2) The Administrative Office of the Courts shall establish a process for identifying
25 all eligible convictions and communicating each eligible conviction to the court
26 in which the conviction occurred, and to the office of the Commonwealth's
27 attorney or county attorney that prosecuted the case. All eligible convictions shall
Page 32 of 34
XXXX 12/26/2024 10:31 AM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 920
1 be communicated to the office of the Commonwealth's attorney or county
2 attorney that prosecuted the case within ninety (90) days of the effective date of
3 this Act.
4 (3) Within ninety (90) days of the receipt of an eligible conviction, the office of the
5 Commonwealth's attorney or county attorney that prosecuted the case may file
6 with the court in which the conviction occurred an objection to the expungement
7 of any eligible conviction which is not an expungeable conviction.
8 (4) Within two hundred (200) days of the effective date of this Act, for any eligible
9 conviction to which the office of the Commonwealth's attorney or county attorney
10 that prosecuted the case has not filed an objection, the court shall order the
11 judgment vacated, and dismiss with prejudice any charges which are eligible for
12 expungement under this section, and order expunged all records in the custody of
13 the court and any records in the custody of any other agency or official, including
14 law enforcement records.
15 (5) (a) Any person who has an eligible conviction prior to the effective date of this
16 Act and whose records have not been expunged pursuant to subsection (4)
17 of this section may at any time after one (1) year after the effective date of
18 this Act petition the court in which the conviction occurred to expunge all
19 eligible convictions.
20 (b) There shall be no filing fee for a petition pursuant to this subsection.
21 (c) An expungement petition brought under this subsection shall be served
22 upon the offices of the county and Commonwealth's attorneys that
23 prosecuted the case, and the court shall notify the county and
24 Commonwealth's attorneys of an opportunity for a response to the petition.
25 The response shall be filed within ninety (90) days after the filing of the
26 petition.
27 (d) If a response is not filed, ninety (90) days after the filing of the petition the
Page 33 of 34

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 920
1 court shall order the judgment vacated, and dismiss with prejudice any
2 charges which are eligible for expungement under this section.
3 (e) If a response is filed objecting to the expungement of the eligible conviction,
4 the court shall within ninety (90) days of the receipt of the objection
5 schedule a hearing on the petition. If, at the hearing, the court finds that the
6 eligible conviction is an expungeable conviction, the court shall order the
7 judgment vacated, and dismiss with prejudice any charges which are
8 eligible for expungement under this section.
9 (6) Upon entry of an order vacating and expunging a conviction, the original
10 conviction shall be vacated and the record shall be expunged. The court and
11 other agencies shall cause records to be deleted or removed from their computer
12 systems so that the matter shall not appear on official state-performed
13 background checks. The court and other agencies shall reply to any inquiry that
14 no record exists on the matter. The person whose record is expunged shall not
15 have to disclose the fact of the record or any matter relating thereto on an
16 application for employment, credit, or other type of application. If the expunged
17 conviction was a felony, and the person is not prohibited from voting for any
18 other reason, the person's ability to vote shall be restored and the person may
19 register to vote.
20 (7) The Administrative Office of the Courts shall, by December 1, 2026, submit a
21 report to the Legislative Research Commission for referral to the Interim Joint
22 Committee on Judiciary, providing data by county on the numbers of eligible
23 convictions identified, objections filed with the court, and the number of
24 expungements granted.
25 (8) This section shall be retroactive.

1 AN ACT relating to cannabis.
2 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
3 SECTION 1. A NEW SECTION OF KRS CHAPTER 218A IS CREATED TO
4 READ AS FOLLOWS:
5 (1) A person twenty-one (21) years of age or older who knowingly and unlawfully
6 possesses, traffics, or cultivates a personal use quantity of cannabis shall not be
7 subject to any penalty for that activity.
8 (2) Possession, trafficking, or cultivation of a personal use quantity of cannabis
9 under this section shall not be considered a criminal offense.
10 (3) No person shall be subject to arrest for possession, trafficking, or cultivation of a
11 personal use quantity of cannabis.
12 (4) If a person has been released on probation, parole, conditional release, or other
13 form of release and is subject to conditions of supervision, then the possession,
14 trafficking, or cultivation of a personal use quantity of cannabis shall not
15 constitute grounds for revocation or other sanctions.
16 Section 2. KRS 218A.010 is amended to read as follows:

5 victim's safety or the safety of a member of the victim's household, or if as a direct
6 result of the crime the victim incurred medical expenses that were paid by the
7 Cabinet for Health and Family Services, the Crime Victims Compensation Board,
8 or any other governmental entity, the court shall order the defendant to make
9 restitution in addition to any other penalty provided for the commission of the
10 offense. Payment of restitution to the victim shall have priority over payment of
11 restitution to any government agency. Restitution shall be ordered in the full
12 amount of the damages, unless the damages exceed one hundred thousand dollars
13 ($100,000) or twice the amount of the gain from the commission of the offense,
14 whichever is greater, in which case the higher of these two (2) amounts shall be
15 awarded. The court may, in lieu of ordering monetary restitution, order the
16 defendant to make restitution by working for or on behalf of the victim. The court
17 shall determine the number of hours of work necessary by applying the then-
18 prevailing federal minimum wage to the total amount of monetary damage caused
19 by or incidental to the commission of the crime. The court may, with the consent of
20 the agency, order the defendant to work as specified in KRS 533.070. Any work
21 ordered pursuant to this section shall not be deemed employment for any purpose,
22 nor shall the person performing the work be deemed an employee for any purpose.
23 Where there is more than one (1) defendant or more than one (1) victim, restitution
24 may be apportioned. Restitution shall be subject to the following additional terms
25 and conditions:
26 (a) Where property which is unlawfully in the possession of the defendant is in
27 substantially undamaged condition from its condition at the time of the taking,

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 920
1 return of the property shall be ordered in lieu of monetary restitution;
2 (b) The circuit clerk shall assess an additional fee of five percent (5%) to defray
3 the administrative costs of collection of payments or property. This fee shall
4 be paid by the defendant and shall inure to a trust and agency account which
5 shall not lapse and which shall be used to hire additional deputy clerks and
6 office personnel or increase deputy clerk or office personnel salaries, or
7 combination thereof;
8 (c) When a defendant fails to make restitution ordered to be paid through the
9 circuit clerk or a court-authorized program run by the county attorney or the
10 Commonwealth's attorney, the circuit clerk or court-authorized program shall
11 notify the court; and
12 (d) An order of restitution shall not preclude the owner of property or the victim
13 who suffered personal physical or mental injury or out-of-pocket loss of
14 earnings or support or other damages from proceeding in a civil action to
15 recover damages from the defendant. A civil verdict shall be reduced by the
16 amount paid under the criminal restitution order.
17 (4) When requiring fees for controlled substances or alcohol tests, or other fees and
18 payments authorized by this section or other statute, except restitution, to be paid by
19 the defendant, the court shall not order the payments to be paid through the circuit
20 clerk.
21 (5) When a defendant is sentenced to probation or conditional discharge, he or she shall
22 be given a written statement explicitly setting forth the conditions under which he
23 or she is being released.
24 (6) When imposing a sentence of probation or conditional discharge, the court, in
25 addition to conditions imposed under this section, may require as a condition of the
26 sentence that the defendant submit to a period of imprisonment in the county jail or
27 to a period of home incarceration at whatever time or intervals, consecutive or
Page 30 of 34

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 920
1 nonconsecutive, the court shall determine. The time actually spent in confinement
2 or home incarceration pursuant to this provision shall not exceed twelve (12)
3 months or the maximum term of imprisonment assessed pursuant to KRS Chapter
4 532, whichever is the shorter. Time spent in confinement or home incarceration
5 under this subsection shall be credited against the maximum term of imprisonment
6 assessed for the defendant pursuant to KRS Chapter 532, if probation or conditional
7 discharge is revoked and the defendant is sentenced to imprisonment. Any
8 prohibitions against probation, shock probation, or conditional discharge under
9 KRS 533.060(2) or 532.045 shall not apply to persons convicted of a misdemeanor
10 or Class D felony and sentenced to a period of confinement or home incarceration
11 under this section.
12 Section 9. KRS 138.872 is amended to read as follows:
13 (1) A tax is hereby levied on each offender engaging in a taxable activity in this state.
14 The tax shall be paid at the following rates:
15 (a) One thousand dollars ($1,000) per plant, whether growing or detached from
16 the soil, on each cannabis[marijuana] plant with foliation which exceeds a
17 personal use quantity of cannabis as defined in Section 2 of this Act;
18 (b) Three dollars and fifty cents ($3.50) on each gram, or portion thereof, of
19 cannabis[marijuana] which has been detached from the plant on which it
20 grew and which exceeds a personal use quantity of cannabis as defined in
21 Section 2 of this Act;
22 (c) Two hundred dollars ($200) on each gram, or portion thereof, of controlled
23 substances; and
24 (d) Two thousand dollars ($2,000) on each fifty (50) dosage units, or portion
25 thereof, of a controlled substance that is not sold by weight.
26 (2) For the purpose of calculating the tax levied pursuant to subsections (1)(b), (1)(c),
27 and (1)(d) of this section, the quantity shall be measured by the weight of the
Page 31 of 34
XXXX 12/26/2024 10:31 AM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 920
1 cannabis[marijuana] or controlled substance, whether pure, impure, or diluted, or
2 by dosage units when a controlled substance is not sold by weight.
3 (3) An offender lawfully engaged in a taxable activity shall be exempt from the tax
4 imposed by this section if the offender is not in violation of any law which
5 authorizes him or her to engage in the activity.
6 SECTION 10. A NEW SECTION OF KRS CHAPTER 431 IS CREATED TO
7 READ AS FOLLOWS:
8 (1) As used in this section:
9 (a) "Cannabis accessory" has the same meaning as in Section 2 of this Act;
10 (b) "Eligible conviction" means any criminal conviction for a violation of
11 Section 3 of this Act, subsection (2) of Section 4 of this Act, subsection (2)
12 of Section 5 of this Act, or Section 6 of this Act, or a conviction for an
13 offense prior to July 14, 1992, for possession, cultivation, or trafficking of
14 marijuana which was punishable by not more than five (5) years'
15 incarceration;
16 (c) "Expungeable conviction" means any eligible conviction for which the
17 available record does not indicate that the offense involved a quantity of
18 marijuana in excess of the personal use quantity of cannabis, or, for a
19 conviction pursuant to Section 6 of this Act, the record does not indicate
20 that the offense involved drug paraphernalia other than cannabis
21 accessories; and
22 (d) "Personal use quantity of cannabis" has the same meaning as in Section 2
23 of this Act.
24 (2) The Administrative Office of the Courts shall establish a process for identifying
25 all eligible convictions and communicating each eligible conviction to the court
26 in which the conviction occurred, and to the office of the Commonwealth's
27 attorney or county attorney that prosecuted the case. All eligible convictions shall
Page 32 of 34
XXXX 12/26/2024 10:31 AM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 920
1 be communicated to the office of the Commonwealth's attorney or county
2 attorney that prosecuted the case within ninety (90) days of the effective date of
3 this Act.
4 (3) Within ninety (90) days of the receipt of an eligible conviction, the office of the
5 Commonwealth's attorney or county attorney that prosecuted the case may file
6 with the court in which the conviction occurred an objection to the expungement
7 of any eligible conviction which is not an expungeable conviction.
8 (4) Within two hundred (200) days of the effective date of this Act, for any eligible
9 conviction to which the office of the Commonwealth's attorney or county attorney
10 that prosecuted the case has not filed an objection, the court shall order the
11 judgment vacated, and dismiss with prejudice any charges which are eligible for
12 expungement under this section, and order expunged all records in the custody of
13 the court and any records in the custody of any other agency or official, including
14 law enforcement records.
15 (5) (a) Any person who has an eligible conviction prior to the effective date of this
16 Act and whose records have not been expunged pursuant to subsection (4)
17 of this section may at any time after one (1) year after the effective date of
18 this Act petition the court in which the conviction occurred to expunge all
19 eligible convictions.
20 (b) There shall be no filing fee for a petition pursuant to this subsection.
21 (c) An expungement petition brought under this subsection shall be served
22 upon the offices of the county and Commonwealth's attorneys that
23 prosecuted the case, and the court shall notify the county and
24 Commonwealth's attorneys of an opportunity for a response to the petition.
25 The response shall be filed within ninety (90) days after the filing of the
26 petition.
27 (d) If a response is not filed, ninety (90) days after the filing of the petition the
Page 33 of 34

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 920
1 court shall order the judgment vacated, and dismiss with prejudice any
2 charges which are eligible for expungement under this section.
3 (e) If a response is filed objecting to the expungement of the eligible conviction,
4 the court shall within ninety (90) days of the receipt of the objection
5 schedule a hearing on the petition. If, at the hearing, the court finds that the
6 eligible conviction is an expungeable conviction, the court shall order the
7 judgment vacated, and dismiss with prejudice any charges which are
8 eligible for expungement under this section.
9 (6) Upon entry of an order vacating and expunging a conviction, the original
10 conviction shall be vacated and the record shall be expunged. The court and
11 other agencies shall cause records to be deleted or removed from their computer
12 systems so that the matter shall not appear on official state-performed
13 background checks. The court and other agencies shall reply to any inquiry that
14 no record exists on the matter. The person whose record is expunged shall not
15 have to disclose the fact of the record or any matter relating thereto on an
16 application for employment, credit, or other type of application. If the expunged
17 conviction was a felony, and the person is not prohibited from voting for any
18 other reason, the person's ability to vote shall be restored and the person may
19 register to vote.
20 (7) The Administrative Office of the Courts shall, by December 1, 2026, submit a
21 report to the Legislative Research Commission for referral to the Interim Joint
22 Committee on Judiciary, providing data by county on the numbers of eligible
23 convictions identified, objections filed with the court, and the number of
24 expungements granted.
25 (8) This section shall be retroactive.
