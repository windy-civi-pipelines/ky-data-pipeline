10 benefits for which he or she is eligible and qualified to receive benefits under this
11 chapter. A waiting week period shall be required for each benefit year, whether or
12 not consecutive. No more than one (1) waiting week period shall be required in any

17 with administrative regulations promulgated by the secretary;
18 (b) He or she participates in reemployment services, such as job search assistance

20 she has been determined to be likely to exhaust regular benefits unless:

22 or
23 2. There is justifiable cause for the claimant's failure to participate in the
24 services. For the purpose of this section, "justifiable cause" shall be
25 interpreted to mean what a reasonable person would do in like
26 circumstances; and

2 to or interviews with different locations of the same franchise shall

16 (4) He or she is physically and mentally able to work;
17 (5) He or she is available for suitable work, and making such reasonable effort to

21 dollars ($1,500), and his or her total base-period wages are not less than one and
22 one-half (1-1/2) times the base-period wages paid to him or her in such quarter and
23 he or she was paid base-period wages in the last six (6) months of his or her base
24 period equal to at least eight (8) times his or her weekly benefit rate with a
25 minimum of one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500) earned outside the high
26 quarter. Beginning on January 1, 2020, and continuing on January 1 in even-
27 numbered years thereafter, the secretary shall adjust the minimum base-period

1 wages at a rate that is directly proportional to the average percentage change in the
2 Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for the two (2) previous
3 calendar years;
4 (7) An otherwise eligible worker shall not be denied benefits under subsection (5) of
5 this section or because of his or her failure to actively seek work under subsection
6 (3) of this section, nor disqualified under paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of KRS

11 within a period of sixteen (16) weeks from the date of filing of the initial or
12 reopened claim.
13 (8) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no otherwise eligible worker
14 shall be denied benefits for any week because he or she is in training approved
15 under 19 U.S.C. sec. 2296 (Section 236(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974), nor shall
16 such worker be denied benefits by reason of leaving work to enter such training
17 provided such work is not suitable employment, or because of the application to any
18 such week in training of provisions in this law (or any applicable federal
19 unemployment compensation law) relating to availability for work, active search
20 for work, or refusal to accept work. For purpose of this subsection, the term
21 "suitable employment" shall mean employment of a substantially equal or higher
22 skill level than the worker's past adversely affected employment as defined in 19
23 U.S.C. sec. 2319 (Trade Act of 1974), and wages for such work are not less than
24 eighty percent (80%) of the workers' average weekly wage as determined for
25 purposes of the Trade Act of 1974.
26 (9) The foregoing eligibility requirements and the conditions of benefit
27 disqualifications imposed by KRS 341.370 shall be strictly construed. Nothing in

5 requirements of this section, and shall submit an annual report to the Governor and

7 detailing:

11 claimants;
12 (c) Recommendations to make the work search activity requirement more
13 effective in assisting claimants in finding employment;
14 (d) The number of claims audited each week and the total number of claims
15 audited during the reporting period;
16 (e) The percentage of total claims audited each week and percentage of total
17 claims audited during the reporting period; and
18 (f) A summary of the methodology used to conduct randomized auditing.
19 (11) The secretary shall promulgate regulations and standards for the verification of
20 claimants' work search activities and the methods by which claimants shall submit
