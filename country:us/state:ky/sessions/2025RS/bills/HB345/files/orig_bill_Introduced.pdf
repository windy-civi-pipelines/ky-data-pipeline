UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1404
1 (2) Respondents to the request for proposal shall provide the following:
2 (a) A detailed list of the proposed energy conservation measures and the
3 guaranteed savings which shall be supported with calculations. Any
4 guaranteed energy and operational savings shall be determined by using one
5 of the measurement and verification methodologies listed in the United States
6 Department of Energy's "Measurement and Verification Guideline for Federal
7 Energy Projects" or in the "North American Energy Measurement and
8 Verification Protocol." If due to existing data limitations or the
9 nonconformance of specific project characteristics, none of the methods listed
10 in either the United States Department of Energy's "Measurement and
11 Verification Guideline for Federal Energy Projects" or in the "North
12 American Energy Measurement and Verification Protocol" is sufficient for
13 measuring guaranteed savings, the qualified provider shall develop an
14 alternate method that is compatible with one (1) of the two (2);
15 (b) The estimated cost of the proposed energy conservation measures including
16 engineering, construction, commissioning, measurement and verification,
17 annual reconciliation statements, and required on-going services; and
18 (c) Proposed method and costs of financing.
19 (3) The value for total cost of the contract minus the calculated savings from the energy
20 conservation measures listed in the qualified provider's proposal, shall be within
21 fifteen percent (15%) of the value for the total cost of the contract minus the
22 calculated savings after the final contract has been negotiated. If the difference
23 between the proposed and the final contract is not within fifteen percent (15%) and
24 the local public agency and the qualified provider are unable to renegotiate the final
25 contract to reconcile the difference between the proposed and final contract values,
26 then the local public agency may:
27 (a) Stop negotiations with the current qualified provider; and
Page 6 of 19
XXXX 2/5/2025 8:32 AM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1404
1 (b) Select an alternate provider.
2 (4) The local public agency may, as a component of the request for proposal, solicit and
3 negotiate additional maintenance services for the affected proposed energy
4 conservation measures. Additional services shall be subject to budget
5 appropriations on an annual basis and may be discontinued at any time over the
6 guarantee period with no negative impact to the guaranteed savings contract.
7 (5) The local public agency shall utilize the request for proposal process to enter into a
8 guaranteed energy savings contract. The local public agency may, at its discretion,
9 utilize a request for qualifications, provided that the local public agency solicits
10 qualification statements from multiple potentially qualified providers. The local
11 public agency shall use the qualification statements to select no fewer than two (2)
12 providers and each provider shall then be subject to the request-for-proposal
13 requirement provided in subsections (1) to (4) of this section.
14 (6) The local public agency shall select the provider best qualified to meet its needs.
15 The local public agency shall provide public notice of the meeting at which it
16 proposes to award a guaranteed energy savings contract, the name of the parties to
17 the proposed contract, and the purpose of the contract. The public notice shall be
18 made at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting. After reviewing the proposals, a
19 local public agency may enter into a guaranteed energy savings contract with a
20 qualified provider if it finds that the amount it would spend on the energy
21 conservation measures recommended in the proposal would not exceed the amount
22 to be saved in either energy or operational costs plus capital cost avoidance within
23 the term of the contract from the date of installation, if the recommendations in the
24 proposal are followed.
25 (7) The guaranteed energy savings contract shall include a written guarantee of the
26 qualified provider that either the energy or operational costs savings plus capital
27 cost avoidance will meet or exceed the costs of the energy conservation measures

1 within the term of the contract. The qualified provider shall, on an annual basis,
2 reimburse the local public agency for any shortfall in guaranteed energy savings
3 projected in the contract. A qualified provider shall provide a sufficient bond to the
4 local public agency for the installation and the faithful performance of all the
5 measures included in the contract. The guaranteed energy savings contract may
6 provide for payments over a period of time, not to exceed the term of the contract.
7 (8) The qualified provider shall provide the local public agency with an annual
8 reconciliation statement. The statement shall disclose any shortfalls or surplus
9 between guaranteed energy and operational savings specified in the guaranteed
10 energy savings contract and actual energy and operational savings incurred during a
11 given guarantee year. The guarantee year shall consist of a twelve (12) month term
12 commencing from the time that the energy conservation measures became fully
13 operational. The qualified provider shall pay the local public agency any short fall
14 in the guaranteed energy and operation savings within thirty (30) days after the total
15 year savings have been determined. If there is a surplus in the actual guaranteed
16 energy and operational savings in a given year, that surplus savings may be carried
17 forward and applied against any possible savings shortfall in the following
18 guarantee year, except that the surplus carried forward is limited to a period not to
19 exceed one (1) year. If the qualified provider pays the local public agency for a
20 short fall in energy or operational savings incurred during a given guarantee year
21 and there is a surplus in energy or operational savings in future guarantee years, the
22 qualified provider shall bill the local public agency for an amount not to exceed the
23 amount of the short fall in the given guarantee year.
24 (9) The use of capital cost avoidance shall be subject to the following restrictions:
25 (a) The amount expended shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the project cost;
26 and
27 (b) Capital cost avoidance shall be restricted to payment for permanent equipment

1 materials necessary for the construction and maintenance of roads.
2 (3)[(2)] Before advertising for bids for the construction or reconstruction of any
3 highway, the department may determine the type of improvement desired, and may
4 advertise and receive bids for only the types determined. The advertisement shall
5 make it generally known that the work is to be done, and shall state the place where
6 the bidders may examine the plans and specifications.
7 Section 10. KRS 176.080 is amended to read as follows:
8 (1) Sections 1, 2, and 3 of this Act shall apply to all contracts issued by the

1 requirement of advertisement for bids, no city, county, or district, or board or
2 commission of a city or county, or sheriff or county clerk, may make a contract,
3 lease, or other agreement for:
4 (a) Materials;
5 (b) Supplies, except perishable foods such as meat, poultry, fish, egg products,

12 construction or maintenance of a public building or other public works. This
13 subsection shall not apply to the transfer of property between governmental
14 agencies as authorized in KRS 82.083(4)(a).
15 (2) If the fiscal court requires that the sheriff or county clerk advertise for bids on
16 expenditures of less than forty thousand dollars ($40,000), the fiscal court
17 requirement shall prevail.
18 (3) (a) Nothing in this statute shall limit or restrict the ability of a local school district
19 to acquire supplies and equipment outside of the bidding procedure if those
20 supplies and equipment meet the specifications of the contracts awarded by
21 the Office of Material and Procurement Services in the Office of the
22 Controller within the Finance and Administration Cabinet or a federal, local,
23 or cooperative agency and are available for purchase elsewhere at a lower
24 price. A board of education may purchase those supplies and equipment
25 without advertising for bids if, prior to making the purchases, the board of
26 education obtains certification from the district's finance or purchasing officer
27 that the items to be purchased meet the standards and specifications fixed by

1 state price contract, federal (GSA) price contract, or the bid of another school
2 district whose bid specifications allow other districts to utilize their bids, and
3 that the sales price is lower than that established by the various price contract
4 agreements or available through the bid of another school district whose bid
5 specifications would allow the district to utilize their bid.
6 (b) The procedures set forth in paragraph (a) of this subsection shall not be
7 available to the district for any specific item once the bidding procedure has
8 been initiated by an invitation to bid and a publication of specifications for
9 that specific item has been published. In the event that all bids are rejected,
10 the district may again avail itself of the provisions of paragraph (a) of this
11 subsection.
12 (4) This requirement shall not apply in an emergency if the chief executive officer of
13 the city, county, or district has duly certified that an emergency exists, and has filed
14 a copy of the certificate with the chief financial officer of the city, county, or
15 district, or if the sheriff or the county clerk has certified that an emergency exists,
16 and has filed a copy of the certificate with the clerk of the court where his or her
17 necessary office expenses are fixed pursuant to KRS 64.345 or 64.530, or if the
18 superintendent of the board of education has duly certified that an emergency
19 exists, and has filed a copy of the certificate with the chief state school officer.
20 (5) The provisions of subsection (1) of this section shall not apply for the purchase of
21 wholesale electric power for resale to the ultimate customers of a municipal utility
22 organized under KRS 96.550 to 96.900.
23 (6) Subsection (1) of this section shall not apply to purchases for products or services
24 made pursuant to KRS 82.084.
