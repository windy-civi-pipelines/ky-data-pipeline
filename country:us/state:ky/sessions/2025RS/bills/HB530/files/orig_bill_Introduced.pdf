1 making, the commissioner of education shall enforce maximum class sizes for

20 school year. A district shall not receive in any one (1) year exemptions for
21 more classes than enroll twenty percent (20%) of the pupils in the primary
22 grades and grades four (4) through eight (8).

1 shall not be granted if the increased class size will impede any exceptional
2 child from achieving his or her individual education program in the least
3 restrictive environment.
4 (6) In grades four (4) through six (6) with combined grades, the maximum class size
5 shall be the average daily attendance upon which funding is appropriated for the
6 lowest assigned grade in the class. There shall be no exceptions to the maximum
7 class size for combined classes. In combined classes other than the primary grades,
8 no ungraded students shall be placed in a combined class with graded students. In
9 addition, there shall be no more than two (2) consecutive grade levels combined in
10 any one (1) class in grades four (4) through six (6). However, this shall not apply to
11 schools which have implemented school-based decision making.

13 that an appropriate program in the least restrictive environment for a particular child
14 with a disability includes either part-time or full-time enrollment with a private
15 school or agency within the state or a public or private agency in another state, the
16 school district shall count as average daily attendance in a public school the time
17 that the child is in attendance at the school or agency, contingent upon approval by
18 the commissioner of education.
19 (8) Pupils attending a center for child learning and study established under an
20 agreement pursuant to KRS 65.210 to 65.300 shall, for the purpose of calculating
21 average daily attendance, be considered as in attendance in the school district in
22 which the child legally resides and which is party to the agreement. For purposes of
23 subsection (1) of this section, teachers who are actually employees of the joint or
24 cooperative action shall be considered as employees of each school district which is
25 a party to the agreement.
26 (9) Program funding shall be increased when the average daily attendance in any
27 district for the first two (2) months of the current school year is greater than the
Page 7 of 13

2 school year. The program funds allotted the district shall be increased by the
3 percent of increase.[ The average daily attendance in kindergarten is the
4 kindergarten full-time equivalent pupils in average daily attendance.]
5 (10) If the average daily attendance for the current school year in any district decreases
6 by ten percent (10%) or more than the average daily attendance for the previous
7 school year, the average daily attendance for purposes of calculating program
8 funding for the next school year shall be increased by an amount equal to two-thirds
9 (2/3) of the decrease in average daily attendance. If the average daily attendance
10 remains the same or decreases in the succeeding school year, the average daily
11 attendance for purposes of calculating program funding for the following school
12 year shall be increased by an amount equal to one-third (1/3) of the decrease for the
13 first year of the decline.
14 (11) If the percentage of attendance of any school district shall have been reduced more
15 than two percent (2%) during the previous school year, the program funding
16 allotted the district for the current school year shall be increased by the difference in
17 the percentage of attendance for the two (2) years immediately prior to the current
18 school year less two percent (2%).
19 (12) (a) Instructional salaries for vocational agriculture classes shall be for twelve (12)

2 that the teacher is scheduled to attend an institution of higher education class

9 The supervision and accountability of teachers of vocational agriculture's
10 summer programs shall be the responsibility of the local school
11 superintendent. The local school superintendent shall submit to the
12 commissioner of education a completed report of summer tasks for each
13 vocational agriculture teacher. Twenty percent (20%) of the approved
14 vocational agriculture programs shall be audited annually by the State
15 Department of Education to determine that the summer plan has been properly
16 executed.
17 (13) (a) In allotting program funds for home and hospital instruction, statewide
18 guaranteed base funding, excluding the capital outlay, shall be allotted for
19 each child in average daily attendance in the prior school year who has been

21 adjustments in the allotments approved under this subsection shall be proportional
22 to the remaining days in the school year and subject to available funds under the
23 program to support education excellence in Kentucky.
24 (17) To calculate the state portion of the program to support education excellence in
25 Kentucky for a school district, the Department of Education shall subtract the local
26 effort required under KRS 157.390(5) from the calculated base funding under the
27 program to support education excellence in Kentucky, as required by this section.
