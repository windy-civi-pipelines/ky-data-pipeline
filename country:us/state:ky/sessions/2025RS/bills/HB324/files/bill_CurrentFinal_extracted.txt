22 for five (5) years shall be issued. The Education Professional Standards Board shall
23 promulgate administrative regulations to establish the standards and procedures for

9 candidates shall be informed of their strengths and weaknesses in the specific
10 performance areas. The Education Professional Standards Board shall provide for
11 confidentiality of the individual assessment scores. Scores shall be available only to

2 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
3 Section 1. KRS 160.160 is amended to read as follows:
4 (1) Each school district shall be under the management and control of a board of
5 education consisting of five (5) members, except in counties containing a city of the
6 first class wherein a merger pursuant to KRS 160.041 shall have been accomplished
7 which shall have seven (7) members elected from the divisions and in the manner
8 prescribed by KRS 160.210(5), to be known as the "Board of Education of ....,

11 necessary for liability insurance premiums and for the defense of any civil action
12 brought against an individual board member in his official or individual capacity, or
13 both, on account of an act made in the scope and course of his performance of legal
14 duties as a board member; purchase, receive, hold, and sell property; issue its bonds
15 to build and construct improvements; and do all things necessary to accomplish the
16 purposes for which it is created. Each board of education shall elect a chairman and
17 vice chairman from its membership in a manner and for a term prescribed by the
18 board not to exceed two (2) years.
19 (2) No board of education shall participate in any financing of school buildings, school
20 improvements, appurtenances thereto, or furnishing and equipment, including

23 receipt of advertised, public, and competitive bids for such project, in
24 accordance with KRS Chapter 424; and
25 (b) Establishing the cost of financing in advance of the sale of any bonds,

1 participations, or other financial arrangements shall not involve a final
2 commitment of the board until the purchaser or lender involved shall have
3 been determined by public advertising in accordance with KRS Chapter 424.
4 (3) No board of education shall make a mortgage, lien, or other encumbrance upon any
5 school building owned by the board, or transfer title to any such school building as
6 part of any financing arrangement, without the specific approval of the Department
7 of Education, and without the transaction being entered into pursuant to a detailed
8 plan or procedure specifically authorized by Kentucky statute.
9 (4) Without the approval of the Department of Education, no board may lease, as
10 lessee, a building or public facility that has been or is to be financed at the request
11 of the board or on its behalf through the issuance of bonds by another public body
12 or by a nonprofit corporation serving as an agency and instrumentality of the board,
13 or by a leasing corporation. Any lease, participation, or other financial arrangement
14 shall not involve a final commitment of the board unless and until the purchaser or
15 lender involved in same shall have been determined by public advertising in
16 accordance with KRS Chapter 424. No transaction shall be entered into by the
17 board except upon the basis of public advertising and competitive bidding in
18 accordance with KRS Chapter 424.
19 (5) A school district may issue general obligation bonds in accordance with KRS
20 Chapter 66.

26 facility. If a board fails to make a rental payment when due under a lease or a debt
27 service payment when due for a general obligation bond issue, upon notification to
Page 2 of 20

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS HB 324/GA
1 the Department of Education by the paying agent, bond registrar, or trustee for the
2 bonds not less than three (3) days prior to the interest due date, the Department of
3 Education shall withhold or intercept any funds then due the board to the extent of
4 the amount of the required payment on the bonds and remit the amount to the
5 paying agent, bond registrar, or trustee as appropriate. Thereafter, the Department
6 of Education shall resolve the matter with the board and adjust remittances to the

8 board's behalf.
9 (7) Bonds, notes, or leases negotiated to provide education technology shall not be sold
10 for longer than seven (7) years or the useful life of the equipment as established by
11 the state technology master plan, whichever is less.
12 (8) Notwithstanding any requirements of public advertising, competitive bidding, or
13 approval by the Department of Education, or any administrative regulation
14 promulgated pursuant to KRS 156.160(1)(o), a local board may authorize the
15 transfer or sale of the district's real or personal property to another governmental or
16 quasi-governmental agency in exchange for money or a similar type of property that
17 equals or exceeds the fair market value of the district property as determined by an

25 requirements on appropriate assessments to measure content knowledge,
26 competency in educational practices, or both. A local board establishing score
27 requirements shall identify any assessment that is required for a specified
Page 3 of 20
HB032410.100 - 13 - XXXX 3/12/2025 4:13 PM GA

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS HB 324/GA
1 certified position and the minimum score the district will require of applicants.
2 This information shall be included in any of the district's posts or notices
3 regarding the related vacancy. Any minimum score shall be for an assessment
4 that is valid and reasonably related to the certified position for which the local
5 board establishes the requirement.
6 Section 2. KRS 161.030 is amended to read as follows:
7 (1) Notwithstanding the age of the pupil, the certification of all teachers and other
8 school personnel, in public schools only, is vested in the Education Professional
9 Standards Board. When so certified, teachers and other school personnel shall not
10 be required to have licensure, certification, or other forms of approval from any
11 other state agency for the performance of their respective assignments within the
12 system of public schools, except as provided for by law. All certificates authorized
13 under KRS 161.010 to 161.126 shall be issued in accordance with the
14 administrative regulations of the Education Professional Standards Board. After
15 July 15, 1994, all certificate applications and other data collection instruments of
16 the board shall include a request for voluntary information about the applicant's
17 ethnic background. This information shall be available to help local school districts
18 locate minority candidates. A person who holds a certificate prior to this
19 requirement may request that ethnic information be added to his or her file. Nothing
20 in this section shall preclude the right of an individual in a nonpublic school from
21 seeking voluntary certification by the Education Professional Standards Board.
22 (2) Certificates shall be issued upon written application and in accordance with statutes
23 and regulations in effect at the time of application to persons who have completed,
24 at colleges, universities, or local school district programs approved by the
25 Education Professional Standards Board for the preparation of teachers and other
26 school personnel, the curricula prescribed by the administrative regulations of the
27 Education Professional Standards Board. An approved applicant shall receive a
Page 4 of 20
HB032410.100 - 13 - XXXX 3/12/2025 4:13 PM GA

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS HB 324/GA
1 five (5) year professional certificate.
2 (3)[ (a) Certification of all new teachers and teachers seeking additional certification
3 shall require the successful completion of appropriate assessments prior to
4 certification. The assessments shall be selected by the Education Professional
5 Standards Board and shall measure knowledge in the specific teaching field of the
6 applicant, including content of the field and teaching of that content. The Education
7 Professional Standards Board shall determine the minimum acceptable level of
8 achievement on each assessment. The assessments shall measure those concepts,
9 ideas, and facts which are being taught in teacher education programs in Kentucky.
10 Upon successful completion of the assessments and the approved teacher
11 preparation program, a professional certificate valid for five (5) years shall be
12 issued.
13 (b) If an applicant for teacher certification has completed the approved teacher
14 preparation program and has taken but failed to successfully complete the
15 appropriate assessments selected by the Education Professional Standards Board, a
16 conditional certificate may be issued for a period not to exceed one (1) year. The
17 employing school district, in collaboration with the teacher education institution,
18 shall provide technical assistance and mentoring support to the conditionally
19 certified teacher. The teacher shall retake the assessments during the validity period
20 of the conditional certificate. The conditional certificate shall not be reissued. Upon
21 successful completion of the required assessments, a professional certificate valid
22 for five (5) years shall be issued. The Education Professional Standards Board shall
23 promulgate administrative regulations to establish the standards and procedures for
24 issuance of a conditional certificate.
25 (c) If an out-of-state teacher with less than two (2) years' experience comes to
26 Kentucky after the deadline for taking the assessments, a temporary certificate may
27 be issued for a period up to six (6) months. The teacher shall take the assessments
Page 5 of 20
HB032410.100 - 13 - XXXX 3/12/2025 4:13 PM GA

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS HB 324/GA
1 during the period of the temporary certificate. If the teacher fails the assessments,
2 the temporary certificate shall be valid only for the current semester. If the teacher
