3 ïƒ¢Section 1. KRS 154.12-330 is amended to read as follows:
4 (1) The Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority is hereby authorized to
5 develop and fund a small business loan program to assist new or existing small
6 businesses operating in the Commonwealth. The authority may lend up to one
7 hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) to any eligible small business for acquisition,

11 issued under this section, including collateral requirements when deemed
12 reasonable and appropriate. Recognizing that small businesses, while essential for
13 the economic vitality of the Commonwealth, may have difficulty obtaining
14 conventional loans, the authority may provide terms that are more lenient, high-risk,
15 less secure, or otherwise less stringent than industry standards.
16 (3) To be eligible for a loan under this section, a small business shall:
17 (a) Be engaged in manufacturing, agribusiness, or service or technology;[, shall ]
18 (b) Not be engaged primarily in retail;[,] and[ shall ]
19 (c) Commit to creating and maintaining at least one (1) new full-time job above
20 the number existing on the date of application.
