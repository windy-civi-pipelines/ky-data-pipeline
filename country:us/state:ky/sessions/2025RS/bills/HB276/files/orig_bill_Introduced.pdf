22 public college and university system focusing its efforts and resources on the goals

8 four (4) year postsecondary institutions.
9 (3) (a) The General Assembly hereby declares these goals can best be accomplished
10 by implementing a comprehensive funding model for the allocation of state
11 general fund appropriations for postsecondary institution operations that
12 aligns the Commonwealth's investments in postsecondary education with the
13 Commonwealth's postsecondary education policy goals and objectives.
14 (b) The General Assembly further recognizes that priority for state general fund

17 purposes of this section, "funding floor" means an institution's fiscal year
18 2020-2021 general fund appropriation included in 2020 Ky. Acts ch. 92, plus

20 fiscal year 2020-2021 debt service on bonds and appropriations for mandated
21 programs.
22 (4) This section establishes a comprehensive funding model for the public
23 postsecondary education system to be implemented by the Council on
24 Postsecondary Education. The funding model shall include a public university
25 sector formula and a KCTCS sector formula, and shall not include any race-based
26 metrics or targets in the formulas.
27 (5) The funding formula for the public university sector shall:
Page 3 of 10
XXXX 2/4/2025 12:37 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1208

2 universities and comprehensive universities to ensure that neither are
3 advantaged or disadvantaged during the first full year of implementation;
4 (b) Distribute one hundred percent (100%) of the university allocable resources
5 for all universities in the sector, based on rational criteria, including student
6 success, course completion, and operational support components, regardless
7 of whether state funding for postsecondary institution operations increases,
8 decreases, or remains stable;
9 (c) Include an adjustment to minimize impact on smaller campuses as determined
10 by the council; and
11 (d) Be constructed to achieve equilibrium, at which point the funding formula
12 rewards rates of improvement above the sector average rate.
13 (6) Funding for the public university sector shall be distributed as follows:

15 based on each university's share of total student success outcomes produced,

25 distributed based on each university's share of sector total student credit hours
26 earned, excluding dual credit enrollment, weighted to account for cost
27 differences by academic discipline and course level, such as lower and upper

8 operation of campus facilities and may include a space utilization factor
9 as determined by the council in collaboration with the working group
10 established in subsection (11) of this section;

15 of total full-time equivalent student enrollment to support academic
16 support services such as libraries and academic computing.

22 decreases, or remains stable;
23 (b) May include an adjustment to account for community economic disadvantage

23 implemented by the Governor.
24 (10) (a) By May 1 each year, the council shall certify to the Office of the State Budget
