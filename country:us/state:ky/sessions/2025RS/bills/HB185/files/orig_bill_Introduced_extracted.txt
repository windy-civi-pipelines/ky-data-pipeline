1 61.705, or 78.510 to 78.852, that were available for all members of the system
2 to purchase on August 5, 1997.
3 (c) 1. For service purchased under a before-tax or after-tax installment
4 purchase of service agreement as provided by paragraph (a)2. of this
5 subsection, the cost of the service shall be computed in the same manner
6 as for a lump-sum payment which shall be the principal, except that
7 interest compounded annually at the actuarial rate in effect at the time
8 the member elects to make the purchase shall be added for the period
9 that the installments are to be made.
10 2. Multiple service purchases may be combined under a single installment
11 agreement, except that no employee may make more than one (1)
12 installment purchase at the same time.
13 3. For after-tax installment purchase of service agreements, the employee
14 may elect to stop the installment payments by notifying the system; may
15 have the installment purchase recalculated to add one (1) or more
16 additional service purchases; or may pay by lump sum the remaining
17 principal or a portion of the remaining principal.
18 4. Before-tax installment purchase of service agreements shall be
19 irrevocable, and the employee shall not be able to stop installment
20 payments or to pay off the remaining balance of the purchase of service

24 that the total period allowed for installments shall not be less than one
25 (1) year and shall not exceed five (5) years.

Page 17 of 21
XXXX 12/27/2024 3:51 PM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 488
1 installments for before-tax purchase of service agreements. Upon
2 notification by the system, the employer shall report the installment
3 payments monthly continuously over each twelve (12) month period at
4 the same time as, but separate from, regular employee contributions on
5 the forms or by the computer format specified by the board.
6 7. The system shall determine how much of the total cost represents
7 payment for one (1) month of the service to be purchased and shall
8 credit one (1) month of service to the member's account each time this
9 amount has been paid. The first service credited shall represent the first
10 calendar month of the service to be purchased and each succeeding
11 month of service credit shall represent the succeeding months of that
12 service.
13 8. If the employee utilizing an installment purchase of service agreement
14 dies, retires, does not continue employment in a position required to
15 participate in the system, or elects to stop an after-tax installment
16 purchase of service agreement, the member, or in the case of death, the
17 beneficiary, shall have sixty (60) days to pay the remaining principal or
18 a portion of the remaining principal of the installment purchase of
19 service agreement by lump sum, subject to the restrictions of paragraph
20 (a)1. of this subsection, or by transfer of funds under paragraph (a)3. of
21 this subsection, except that payment by the member shall be filed with
22 the system prior to the member's effective retirement date. If the
23 member or beneficiary does not pay the remaining cost, the system shall
24 refund to the member or the beneficiary the payment, payments, or
25 portion of a payment that does not represent a full month of service
26 purchased, except as provided by subsection (6) of this section.
27 9. If the employer does not report installment payments on an employee
Page 18 of 21

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 488
1 for sixty (60) days for an after-tax installment purchase of service
2 agreement, except in the case of employees on military leave or sick
3 leave without pay, the installment purchase shall cease and the system
4 shall refund to the employee the payment, payments, or portion of a
5 payment that does not represent a full month of service purchased.
6 10. Installment payments of employees on military leave or sick leave
7 without pay shall be suspended during the period of leave and shall
8 resume without recalculation upon the employee's return from leave.
9 11. If payments have ceased under subparagraph 8. or 9. of this paragraph
10 and the member later becomes a participating employee in the County
11 Employees Retirement System, Kentucky Employees Retirement
12 System, or State Police Retirement System, the employee may complete
13 the adjusted original installment purchase by lump sum or installment
14 payments, subject to the restrictions of this subsection. If the employee
15 elects to renew the installment purchase, the cost of the remaining
16 service shall be recalculated in accordance with subsection (10) of this
17 section.
18 (d) Member payments, including interest, properly received pursuant to this
19 subsection, shall be deposited to the member's account and considered as
20 accumulated contributions of the individual member.
21 (10) (a) The cost of purchasing service credit under any provision of this section,
22 except as provided by subsections (1) to (3) of this section, shall be
23 determined by multiplying the higher of the employee's current rate of pay,
24 final rate of pay, or final compensation as of the end of the month in which
25 the purchase is made times the actuarial factor times the number of years of
26 service being purchased. The actuarial factor used to determine the cost of
27 purchasing service credit shall assume the earliest date the member may retire

13 3. For after-tax installment purchase of service agreements, the employee
14 may elect to stop the installment payments by notifying the system; may
15 have the installment purchase recalculated to add one (1) or more
16 additional service purchases; or may pay by lump sum the remaining
17 principal or a portion of the remaining principal.
18 4. Before-tax installment purchase of service agreements shall be
19 irrevocable, and the employee shall not be able to stop installment
20 payments or to pay off the remaining balance of the purchase of service

1 installments for before-tax purchase of service agreements. Upon
2 notification by the system, the employer shall report the installment
3 payments monthly continuously over each twelve (12) month period at
4 the same time as, but separate from, regular employee contributions on
5 the forms or by the computer format specified by the board.
6 7. The system shall determine how much of the total cost represents
7 payment for one (1) month of the service to be purchased and shall
8 credit one (1) month of service to the member's account each time this
9 amount has been paid. The first service credited shall represent the first
10 calendar month of the service to be purchased and each succeeding
11 month of service credit shall represent the succeeding months of that
12 service.
13 8. If the employee utilizing an installment purchase of service agreement
14 dies, retires, does not continue employment in a position required to
15 participate in the system, or elects to stop an after-tax installment
16 purchase of service agreement, the member, or in the case of death, the
17 beneficiary, shall have sixty (60) days to pay the remaining principal or
18 a portion of the remaining principal of the installment purchase of
19 service agreement by lump sum, subject to the restrictions of paragraph
20 (a)1. of this subsection, or by transfer of funds under paragraph (a)3. of
21 this subsection, except that payment by the member shall be filed with
22 the system prior to the member's effective retirement date. If the
23 member or beneficiary does not pay the remaining cost, the system shall
24 refund to the member or the beneficiary the payment, payments, or
25 portion of a payment that does not represent a full month of service
26 purchased, except as provided by subsection (6) of this section.

1 for sixty (60) days for an after-tax installment purchase of service
2 agreement, except in the case of employees on military leave or sick
3 leave without pay, the installment purchase shall cease and the system
4 shall refund to the employee the payment, payments, or portion of a
5 payment that does not represent a full month of service purchased.
6 10. Installment payments of employees on military leave or sick leave
7 without pay shall be suspended during the period of leave and shall

9 11. If payments have ceased under subparagraph 8. or 9. of this paragraph
10 and the member later becomes a participating employee in the County
11 Employees Retirement System, Kentucky Employees Retirement
12 System, or State Police Retirement System, the employee may complete
13 the adjusted original installment purchase by lump sum or installment
14 payments, subject to the restrictions of this subsection. If the employee
15 elects to renew the installment purchase, the cost of the remaining
16 service shall be recalculated in accordance with subsection (10) of this
17 section.
18 (d) Member payments, including interest, properly received pursuant to this
19 subsection, shall be deposited to the member's account and considered as
20 accumulated contributions of the individual member.
21 (10) (a) The cost of purchasing service credit under any provision of this section,
22 except as provided by subsections (1) to (3) of this section, shall be
23 determined by multiplying the higher of the employee's current rate of pay,
24 final rate of pay, or final compensation as of the end of the month in which
25 the purchase is made times the actuarial factor times the number of years of
26 service being purchased. The actuarial factor used to determine the cost of
27 purchasing service credit shall assume the earliest date the member may retire
