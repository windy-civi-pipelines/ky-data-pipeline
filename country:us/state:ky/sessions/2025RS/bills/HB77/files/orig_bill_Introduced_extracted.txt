14 (b) Convicted of a series of Class D felony violations of one (1) or more statutes
15 enumerated in paragraph (a) of this subsection arising from a single incident;
16 (c) Granted a full pardon; or
17 (d) Convicted of a Class D felony, or an offense prior to January 1, 1975 which
18 was punishable by not more than five (5) years' incarceration, which was not a
19 violation of KRS 189A.010, 508.032, or 519.055, abuse of public office, a sex
20 offense, or an offense committed against a child, and did not result in serious
21 bodily injury or death; or of multiple felony offenses eligible under this
22 paragraph;
23 may file with the court in which he or she was convicted an application to have the
24 judgment vacated. The application shall be filed as a motion in the original criminal
25 case. The person shall be informed of the right at the time of adjudication.
26 (2) (a) A verified application to have the judgment vacated under this section shall be
27 filed no sooner than five (5) years after the completion of the person's

4 Court clerk shall serve a notice of filing upon the office of the
5 Commonwealth's attorney or county attorney that prosecuted the case and the
6 county attorney of the county where the judgment was entered. The office of
7 the Commonwealth's attorney or county attorney that prosecuted the case
8 shall file a response within sixty (60) days after being served with the notice
9 of filing. That time period may be extended for good cause, but the hearing on
10 the application to vacate the judgment shall occur no later than one hundred
11 twenty (120) days following the filing of the application. The inability to
12 determine the location of the crime victim shall constitute good cause for an
13 extension of time. No hearing upon the merits of the application shall be
14 scheduled until the Commonwealth's response has been filed, or if no
15 response is received, no later than one hundred twenty (120) days after the
16 filing of the application.
17 (c) In any case in which the Commonwealth objects that the application is grossly
18 incomplete, the court shall order the person or agency originating the
19 application to supplement the application.
20 (3) Upon the filing of the Commonwealth's response to an application, or if no
21 response is received, no later than one hundred twenty (120) days after the filing of
22 the application, the court shall set a date for a hearing and the Circuit Court clerk
23 shall notify the office of the Commonwealth's attorney or county attorney that
24 prosecuted the case. The office of the Commonwealth's attorney or county attorney
25 that prosecuted the case shall notify the victim of the crime, if there was an
26 identified victim. The Commonwealth's attorney or county attorney shall be
27 authorized to obtain without payment of any fee information from the

1 Transportation Cabinet regarding the crime victim's address on file regarding any
2 vehicle operator's license issued to that person.
3 (4) (a) In an application pursuant to subsection (1)(d) of this section, upon the filing
4 of the Commonwealth's response objecting to the vacating of a judgment and
5 expungement of a record, the court shall schedule a hearing within one
6 hundred twenty (120) days of the Commonwealth's response. The prosecutor
7 shall specify in the objection the reasons for believing a denial of the
8 application is justified. At the hearing at which the applicant or his or her
9 attorney must be present, the applicant must prove by clear and convincing
10 evidence that:
11 1. Vacating the judgment and expunging the record is consistent with the
12 welfare and safety of the public;
13 2. The action is supported by his or her behavior since the conviction or
14 convictions, as evidenced that he or she has been active in rehabilitative
15 activities in prison and is living a law-abiding life since release;
16 3. The vacation and expungement is warranted by the interests of justice;
17 and
18 4. Any other matter deemed appropriate or necessary by the court to make
19 a determination regarding the petition for expungement is met.
20 (b) At the hearing, the applicant may testify as to the specific adverse
21 consequences he or she may be subject to if the application is denied. The
22 court may hear testimony of witnesses and any other matter the court deems
23 proper and relevant to its determination regarding the application. The
24 Commonwealth may present proof of any extraordinary circumstances that
25 exist to deny the application. A victim of any offense listed in the application
26 shall have an opportunity to be heard at any hearing held under this section.
27 (c) If the court determines that circumstances warrant vacation and expungement

1 and that the harm otherwise resulting to the applicant clearly outweighs the
2 public interest in the criminal history record information being publicly
3 available, then the original conviction or convictions shall be vacated and the
4 records shall be expunged. The order of expungement shall not preclude a
5 prosecutor's office from retaining a nonpublic record for law enforcement
6 purposes only.
7 (5) The court may order the judgment vacated, and if the judgment is vacated the court
8 shall dismiss with prejudice any charges which are eligible for expungement under
9 subsection (1) of this section or KRS 431.076 or 431.078 and any charges for
10 felonies, misdemeanors, violations, or traffic infractions that were dismissed or
11 amended in the criminal action, and, upon full payment of the fee in subsection
12 (11) of this section, order expunged all records in the custody of the court and any
13 records in the custody of any other agency or official, including law enforcement
14 records, if the court finds that:
15 (a) The person had not in the five (5) years prior to the filing of the application to
16 have the judgment vacated been convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor;
17 (b) No proceeding concerning a felony or misdemeanor is pending [or being
18 instituted ]against the person; and
19 (c) For an application pursuant to subsection (1)(d) of this section, the person has
20 been rehabilitated and poses no significant threat of recidivism.
21 (6) If the court has received a response from the office of the Commonwealth's attorney
22 or county attorney that prosecuted the case stating no objection to the application to
23 have the judgment vacated, or if one hundred twenty (120) days have elapsed since
24 the filing of the application and no response has been received from the victim or
25 the office of the Commonwealth's attorney or county attorney that prosecuted the
26 case, the court may, without a hearing, vacate the judgment in the manner
27 established in subsection (5) of this section.

9 person is not prohibited from voting for any other reason, the person's ability to
10 vote shall be restored and the person may register to vote.

12 expired statute of limitations, shall not constitute a finding of legal error regarding
13 the proceedings leading to or resulting in the conviction, shall not nullify any
14 findings of fact or conclusions of law made by the trial court or any appellate court
15 regarding the conviction, and shall not constitute a finding of innocence regarding

18 used in filing an application to have judgment vacated and records expunged.

1 with the installment payment plan. The applicant shall be given notice of the
2 total amount due, the payment frequency, and the date by which all payments
3 must be made. The notice shall state that the expungement cannot be
4 completed until full payment is received, and that if the applicant has not
5 completed the installment payment plan by the scheduled date, he or she shall
6 appear on that date to show good cause as to why he or she is unable to satisfy
7 the obligations. Notwithstanding [provisions of ]KRS 534.020 to the contrary,
8 no applicant shall be ordered to jail for failure to complete an installment plan

23 convicted of a misdemeanor prior to July 14, 1992, may petition the court in which
24 he was convicted, or if he was convicted prior to the inception of the District Court
25 to the District Court in the county where he now resides, for expungement of the

12 sentence of imprisonment assessed under KRS 532.060 for the crime of which such
13 person presently stands convicted, shall fix a sentence of imprisonment as
14 authorized by subsection (5) or (6) of this section. When a defendant is charged
15 with being a persistent felony offender, the determination of whether or not he or
16 she is such an offender and the punishment to be imposed pursuant to subsection
17 (5) or (6) of this section shall be determined in a separate proceeding from that
18 proceeding which resulted in his or her last conviction. Such proceeding shall be
19 conducted before the court sitting with the jury that found the defendant guilty of
20 his or her most recent offense unless the court for good cause discharges that jury
21 and impanels a new jury for that purpose.
22 (2) A persistent felony offender in the second degree is a person who is more than
23 twenty-one (21) years of age and who stands convicted of a felony after having

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 5
1 felony in this state or conviction of a crime in any other jurisdiction provided:
2 (a) That a sentence to a term of imprisonment of one (1) year or more or a

4 (b) That the offender was over the age of eighteen (18) years at the time the
5 offense was committed; and

1 deemed to be only one (1) conviction, unless one (1) of the convictions was for an
2 offense committed while that person was imprisoned.
3 (5) A person who is found to be a persistent felony offender in the second degree shall
4 be sentenced to an indeterminate term of imprisonment pursuant to the sentencing
5 provisions of KRS 532.060(2) for the next highest degree than the offense for
6 which convicted. A person who is found to be a persistent felony offender in the
7 second degree shall not be eligible for probation, shock probation, or conditional
8 discharge, unless all offenses for which the person stands convicted are Class D
9 felony offenses which do not involve a violent act against a person, in which case

Page 12 of 14
XXXX 1/2/2025 3:58 PM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 5
1 be eligible for probation, shock probation, or conditional discharge, unless all
2 offenses for which the person stands convicted are Class D felony offenses which
3 do not involve a violent act against a person or a sex crime as that term is defined in
4 KRS 17.500, in which case, probation, shock probation, or conditional discharge
5 may be granted. If the offense the person presently stands convicted of is a Class A,
6 B, or C felony, the person shall not be eligible for parole until the person has served
7 a minimum term of incarceration of not less than ten (10) years, unless another
8 sentencing scheme applies. A violent offender who is found to be a persistent
9 felony offender in the first degree shall not be eligible for parole except as provided
10 in KRS 439.3401.
11 (8) A conviction, plea of guilty, or Alford plea under KRS 218A.1415 shall not trigger
12 the application of this section, regardless of the number or type of prior felony
13 convictions that may have been entered against the defendant. A conviction, plea of
14 guilty, or Alford plea under KRS 218A.1415 may be used as a prior felony offense
15 allowing this section to be applied if he or she is subsequently convicted of a
16 different felony offense.
17 (9) The provisions of this section amended by 1994 Ky. Acts ch. 396, sec. 11, shall be
18 retroactive.
19 (10) (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, this section shall not
20 apply to a person convicted of a criminal offense if the penalty for that offense
21 was increased from a misdemeanor to a felony, or from a lower felony
22 classification to a higher felony classification, because the conviction
23 constituted a second or subsequent violation of that offense.
24 (b) This subsection shall not prohibit the application of this section to a person
25 convicted of:
26 1. A felony offense arising out of KRS 189A.010, 189A.090, 506.140,
27 508.032, 508.140, or 510.015; or

1 2. Any other felony offense if the penalty was not enhanced to a higher
2 level because the Commonwealth elected to prosecute the person as a
3 first-time violator of that offense.
4 (11) The enhancement of a sentence pursuant to this section shall not alter the felony
5 classification of the conviction.

2 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:

4 (1) Any person who has been:
5 (a) Convicted of a Class D felony violation of KRS 17.175, 186.990, 194A.505,
6 194B.505, 217.181, 217.207, 217.208, 218A.140, 218A.1415, 218A.1416,
7 218A.1417, 218A.1418, 218A.1423, 218A.1439, 218A.282, 218A.284,
8 218A.286, 218A.320, 218A.322, 218A.324, 218A.500, 244.165, 286.11-057,
9 304.47-025, 324.990, 365.241, 434.155, 434.675, 434.850, 434.872, 511.040,
10 512.020, 514.030, 514.040, 514.050, 514.060, 514.065, 514.070, 514.080,
11 514.090, 514.100, 514.110, 514.120, 514.140, 514.150, 514.160, 516.030,
12 516.060, 516.090, 516.108, 517.120, 518.040, 522.040, 524.100, 525.113,
13 526.020, 526.030, 528.020, 528.040, 528.050, 530.010, or 530.050;
14 (b) Convicted of a series of Class D felony violations of one (1) or more statutes
15 enumerated in paragraph (a) of this subsection arising from a single incident;
16 (c) Granted a full pardon; or
17 (d) Convicted of a Class D felony, or an offense prior to January 1, 1975 which
18 was punishable by not more than five (5) years' incarceration, which was not a
19 violation of KRS 189A.010, 508.032, or 519.055, abuse of public office, a sex
20 offense, or an offense committed against a child, and did not result in serious
21 bodily injury or death; or of multiple felony offenses eligible under this
22 paragraph;
23 may file with the court in which he or she was convicted an application to have the
24 judgment vacated. The application shall be filed as a motion in the original criminal
25 case. The person shall be informed of the right at the time of adjudication.
26 (2) (a) A verified application to have the judgment vacated under this section shall be
27 filed no sooner than five (5) years after the completion of the person's
Page 1 of 14

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 5
1 sentence, or five (5) years after the successful completion of the person's
2 probation or parole, whichever occurs later.
3 (b) Upon the payment of the filing fee and the filing of the application, the Circuit
4 Court clerk shall serve a notice of filing upon the office of the
5 Commonwealth's attorney or county attorney that prosecuted the case and the
6 county attorney of the county where the judgment was entered. The office of
7 the Commonwealth's attorney or county attorney that prosecuted the case
8 shall file a response within sixty (60) days after being served with the notice
9 of filing. That time period may be extended for good cause, but the hearing on
10 the application to vacate the judgment shall occur no later than one hundred
11 twenty (120) days following the filing of the application. The inability to
12 determine the location of the crime victim shall constitute good cause for an
13 extension of time. No hearing upon the merits of the application shall be
14 scheduled until the Commonwealth's response has been filed, or if no
15 response is received, no later than one hundred twenty (120) days after the
16 filing of the application.
17 (c) In any case in which the Commonwealth objects that the application is grossly
18 incomplete, the court shall order the person or agency originating the
19 application to supplement the application.
20 (3) Upon the filing of the Commonwealth's response to an application, or if no
21 response is received, no later than one hundred twenty (120) days after the filing of
22 the application, the court shall set a date for a hearing and the Circuit Court clerk
23 shall notify the office of the Commonwealth's attorney or county attorney that
24 prosecuted the case. The office of the Commonwealth's attorney or county attorney
25 that prosecuted the case shall notify the victim of the crime, if there was an
26 identified victim. The Commonwealth's attorney or county attorney shall be
27 authorized to obtain without payment of any fee information from the

1 Transportation Cabinet regarding the crime victim's address on file regarding any
2 vehicle operator's license issued to that person.
3 (4) (a) In an application pursuant to subsection (1)(d) of this section, upon the filing
4 of the Commonwealth's response objecting to the vacating of a judgment and
5 expungement of a record, the court shall schedule a hearing within one
6 hundred twenty (120) days of the Commonwealth's response. The prosecutor
7 shall specify in the objection the reasons for believing a denial of the
8 application is justified. At the hearing at which the applicant or his or her
9 attorney must be present, the applicant must prove by clear and convincing
10 evidence that:
11 1. Vacating the judgment and expunging the record is consistent with the
12 welfare and safety of the public;
13 2. The action is supported by his or her behavior since the conviction or
14 convictions, as evidenced that he or she has been active in rehabilitative
15 activities in prison and is living a law-abiding life since release;
16 3. The vacation and expungement is warranted by the interests of justice;
17 and
18 4. Any other matter deemed appropriate or necessary by the court to make
19 a determination regarding the petition for expungement is met.
20 (b) At the hearing, the applicant may testify as to the specific adverse
21 consequences he or she may be subject to if the application is denied. The
22 court may hear testimony of witnesses and any other matter the court deems
23 proper and relevant to its determination regarding the application. The
24 Commonwealth may present proof of any extraordinary circumstances that
25 exist to deny the application. A victim of any offense listed in the application
26 shall have an opportunity to be heard at any hearing held under this section.
27 (c) If the court determines that circumstances warrant vacation and expungement

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 5
1 and that the harm otherwise resulting to the applicant clearly outweighs the
2 public interest in the criminal history record information being publicly
3 available, then the original conviction or convictions shall be vacated and the
4 records shall be expunged. The order of expungement shall not preclude a
5 prosecutor's office from retaining a nonpublic record for law enforcement
6 purposes only.
7 (5) The court may order the judgment vacated, and if the judgment is vacated the court
8 shall dismiss with prejudice any charges which are eligible for expungement under
9 subsection (1) of this section or KRS 431.076 or 431.078 and any charges for
10 felonies, misdemeanors, violations, or traffic infractions that were dismissed or
11 amended in the criminal action, and, upon full payment of the fee in subsection
12 (11) of this section, order expunged all records in the custody of the court and any
13 records in the custody of any other agency or official, including law enforcement
14 records, if the court finds that:
15 (a) The person had not in the five (5) years prior to the filing of the application to
16 have the judgment vacated been convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor;
17 (b) No proceeding concerning a felony or misdemeanor is pending [or being
18 instituted ]against the person; and
19 (c) For an application pursuant to subsection (1)(d) of this section, the person has
20 been rehabilitated and poses no significant threat of recidivism.
21 (6) If the court has received a response from the office of the Commonwealth's attorney
22 or county attorney that prosecuted the case stating no objection to the application to
23 have the judgment vacated, or if one hundred twenty (120) days have elapsed since
24 the filing of the application and no response has been received from the victim or
25 the office of the Commonwealth's attorney or county attorney that prosecuted the
26 case, the court may, without a hearing, vacate the judgment in the manner
27 established in subsection (5) of this section.

1 (7) Upon entry of an order vacating and expunging a conviction, the original conviction
2 shall be vacated and, upon full payment of the fee in subsection (11) of this section,
3 the record shall be expunged. The court and other agencies shall cause records to be
4 deleted or removed from their computer systems so that the matter shall not appear
5 on official state-performed background checks. The court and other agencies shall
6 reply to any inquiry that no record exists on the matter. The person whose record is
7 expunged shall not have to disclose the fact of the record or any matter relating
8 thereto on an application for employment, credit, or other type of application. If the
9 person is not prohibited from voting for any other reason, the person's ability to
10 vote shall be restored and the person may register to vote.
11 (8) An order vacating a conviction under this section shall not extend or revive an
12 expired statute of limitations, shall not constitute a finding of legal error regarding
13 the proceedings leading to or resulting in the conviction, shall not nullify any
14 findings of fact or conclusions of law made by the trial court or any appellate court
15 regarding the conviction, and shall not constitute a finding of innocence regarding
16 the conviction.
17 (9) The Administrative Office of the Courts shall establish a form application to be
18 used in filing an application to have judgment vacated and records expunged.
19 (10) The filing fee for an application to have judgment vacated and records expunged
20 shall be fifty dollars ($50), which shall be deposited into a trust and agency account
21 for deputy clerks and shall not be refundable.
22 (11) (a) Upon the issuance of an order vacating and expunging a conviction pursuant
23 to this section, the applicant shall be charged an expungement fee of two
24 hundred fifty dollars ($250), which may be payable by an installment plan in
25 accordance with KRS 534.020.
26 (b) When the order is issued, the court shall set a date, no sooner than eighteen
27 (18) months after the date of the order, by which the defendant must comply
Page 5 of 14

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 5
1 with the installment payment plan. The applicant shall be given notice of the
2 total amount due, the payment frequency, and the date by which all payments
3 must be made. The notice shall state that the expungement cannot be
4 completed until full payment is received, and that if the applicant has not
5 completed the installment payment plan by the scheduled date, he or she shall
6 appear on that date to show good cause as to why he or she is unable to satisfy
7 the obligations. Notwithstanding [provisions of ]KRS 534.020 to the contrary,
8 no applicant shall be ordered to jail for failure to complete an installment plan
9 ordered pursuant to this section.
10 (c) The revenues and interest from the expungement fee shall be deposited in the
11 expungement fund created in KRS 431.0795.
12 (12) This section shall be retroactive.

16 misdemeanor or violation, or a series of misdemeanors, violations, or traffic
17 infractions arising from a single incident; or
18 (b) A series of misdemeanors, violations, or traffic infractions not arising from a
19 single incident;
20 may petition the court in which he or she was convicted for expungement of his or
21 her misdemeanor or violation record within that judicial district, including a record
22 of any charges for felonies, misdemeanors, violations, or traffic infractions that
23 were dismissed or amended in the criminal action. The person shall be informed of
24 the right at the time of adjudication.
25 (2) Except as provided in KRS 218A.275(8) and 218A.276(8), the petition shall be
26 filed no sooner than five (5) years after the completion of the person's sentence or

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 5
1 occurs later.
2 (3) Upon the filing of a petition, the court shall set a date for a hearing, no sooner than
3 thirty (30) days after the filing of the petition, and shall notify the county attorney;
4 the victim of the crime, if there was an identified victim; and any other person
5 whom the person filing the petition has reason to believe may have relevant
6 information related to the expungement of the record. Inability to locate the victim
7 shall not delay the proceedings in the case or preclude the holding of a hearing or
8 the issuance of an order of expungement.
9 (4) For a petition brought under subsection (1)(a) of this section, the court shall order
10 expunged all records in the custody of the court and any records in the custody of
11 any other agency or official, including law enforcement records, if at the hearing
12 the court finds that:
13 (a) The offense was not a sex offense or an offense committed against a child;
14 (b) The person had not in the five (5) years prior to the filing of the petition for
15 expungement been convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor;
16 (c) No proceeding concerning a felony or misdemeanor is pending [or being
17 instituted ]against the person; and
18 (d) The offense is not one subject to enhancement for a second or subsequent
19 offense or, if the law specifies a period for enhancement for a second or
20 subsequent offense, the time for such an enhancement has expired.
21 (5) For a petition brought under subsection (1)(b) of this section, the court may order
22 expunged all records in the custody of the court and any records in the custody of
23 any other agency or official, including law enforcement records, if at the hearing
24 the court finds that:
25 (a) The offense was not a sex offense or an offense committed against a child;
26 (b) The person had not in the five (5) years prior to the filing of the petition for
27 expungement been convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor;
Page 7 of 14
XXXX 1/2/2025 3:58 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 5
1 (c) No proceeding concerning a felony or misdemeanor is pending [or being
2 instituted ]against the person; and
3 (d) The offense is not one subject to enhancement for a second or subsequent
4 offense or, if the law specifies a period for enhancement for a second or
5 subsequent offense, the time for such an enhancement has expired.
6 (6) Upon the entry of an order to expunge the records, the proceedings in the case shall
7 be deemed never to have occurred; the court and other agencies shall cause records
8 to be deleted or removed from their computer systems so that the matter shall not
9 appear on official state-performed background checks; the persons and the court
10 may properly reply that no record exists with respect to the persons upon any
11 inquiry in the matter; and the person whose record is expunged shall not have to
12 disclose the fact of the record or any matter relating thereto on an application for
13 employment, credit, or other type of application.
14 (7) The filing fee for a petition under this section shall be one hundred dollars ($100).
15 The first fifty dollars ($50) of each fee collected pursuant to this subsection shall be
16 deposited into a trust and agency account for deputy clerks and shall not be
17 refundable.
18 (8) Copies of the order shall be sent to each agency or official named therein.
19 (9) Inspection of the records included in the order may thereafter be permitted by the
20 court only upon petition by the person who is the subject of the records and only to
21 those persons named in the petition.
22 (10) This section shall be [deemed to be ]retroactive[, and any person who has been
23 convicted of a misdemeanor prior to July 14, 1992, may petition the court in which
24 he was convicted, or if he was convicted prior to the inception of the District Court
25 to the District Court in the county where he now resides, for expungement of the
26 record of one (1) misdemeanor offense or violation or a series of misdemeanor
27 offenses or violations arising from a single incident, provided that the offense was
Page 8 of 14
XXXX 1/2/2025 3:58 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 5
1 not one specified in subsection (4) and that the offense was not the precursor
2 offense of a felony offense for which he was subsequently convicted. This section
3 shall apply only to offenses against the Commonwealth of Kentucky].
4 (11) As used in this section, "violation" has the same meaning as in KRS 500.080.
5 (12) Any person denied an expungement prior to June 25, 2013, due to the presence of a
6 traffic infraction on his or her record may file a new petition for expungement of
7 the previously petitioned offenses, which the court shall hear and decide under the
8 terms of this section. No court costs or other fees, from the court or any other
9 agency, shall be required of a person filing a new petition under this subsection.
10 ïƒ¢Section 3. KRS 532.080 is amended to read as follows:
11 (1) When a defendant is found to be a persistent felony offender, the jury, in lieu of the
12 sentence of imprisonment assessed under KRS 532.060 for the crime of which such
13 person presently stands convicted, shall fix a sentence of imprisonment as
14 authorized by subsection (5) or (6) of this section. When a defendant is charged
15 with being a persistent felony offender, the determination of whether or not he or
16 she is such an offender and the punishment to be imposed pursuant to subsection
17 (5) or (6) of this section shall be determined in a separate proceeding from that
18 proceeding which resulted in his or her last conviction. Such proceeding shall be
19 conducted before the court sitting with the jury that found the defendant guilty of
20 his or her most recent offense unless the court for good cause discharges that jury
21 and impanels a new jury for that purpose.
22 (2) A persistent felony offender in the second degree is a person who is more than
23 twenty-one (21) years of age and who stands convicted of a felony after having
24 been convicted of one (1) previous felony. As used in this provision, a previous
25 felony conviction is a conviction of a felony in this state or conviction of a crime in
26 any other jurisdiction provided:
27 (a) That a sentence to a term of imprisonment of one (1) year or more or a
Page 9 of 14

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 5
1 sentence to death was imposed therefor; and
2 (b) That the offender was over the age of eighteen (18) years at the time the
3 offense was committed; and
4 (c) That the offender:
5 1. Completed service of the sentence imposed on the previous felony
6 conviction within five (5) years prior to the date of commission of the
7 felony for which he or she now stands convicted; or
8 2. Was on probation, parole, postincarceration supervision, conditional
9 discharge, conditional release, furlough, appeal bond, or any other form
10 of legal release from any of the previous felony convictions at the time
11 of commission of the felony for which he or she now stands convicted;
12 or
13 3. Was discharged from probation, parole, postincarceration supervision,
14 conditional discharge, conditional release, or any other form of legal
15 release on any of the previous felony convictions within five (5) years
16 prior to the date of commission of the felony for which he or she now
17 stands convicted; or
18 4. Was in custody from the previous felony conviction at the time of
19 commission of the felony for which he or she now stands convicted; or
20 5. Had escaped from custody while serving any of the previous felony
21 convictions at the time of commission of the felony for which he or she
22 now stands convicted.
23 (3) A persistent felony offender in the first degree is a person who is more than twenty-
24 one (21) years of age and who stands convicted of a felony after having been
25 convicted of two (2) or more felonies, or one (1) or more felony sex crimes against
26 a minor as defined in KRS 17.500, and now stands convicted of any one (1) or more
27 felonies. As used in this provision, a previous felony conviction is a conviction of a
Page 10 of 14
XXXX 1/2/2025 3:58 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 5
1 felony in this state or conviction of a crime in any other jurisdiction provided:
2 (a) That a sentence to a term of imprisonment of one (1) year or more or a
3 sentence to death was imposed therefor; and
4 (b) That the offender was over the age of eighteen (18) years at the time the
5 offense was committed; and
6 (c) That the offender:
7 1. Completed service of the sentence imposed on any of the previous
8 felony convictions within five (5) years prior to the date of the
9 commission of the felony for which he or she now stands convicted; or

11 discharge, conditional release, furlough, appeal bond, or any other form
12 of legal release from any of the previous felony convictions at the time

14 or
15 3. Was discharged from probation, parole, postincarceration supervision,
16 conditional discharge, conditional release, or any other form of legal
17 release on any of the previous felony convictions within five (5) years
18 prior to the date of commission of the felony for which he or she now

1 deemed to be only one (1) conviction, unless one (1) of the convictions was for an
2 offense committed while that person was imprisoned.
3 (5) A person who is found to be a persistent felony offender in the second degree shall
4 be sentenced to an indeterminate term of imprisonment pursuant to the sentencing
5 provisions of KRS 532.060(2) for the next highest degree than the offense for
6 which convicted. A person who is found to be a persistent felony offender in the
7 second degree shall not be eligible for probation, shock probation, or conditional
8 discharge, unless all offenses for which the person stands convicted are Class D
9 felony offenses which do not involve a violent act against a person, in which case

11 offender who is found to be a persistent felony offender in the second degree shall
12 not be eligible for parole except as provided in KRS 439.3401.

14 sentenced to imprisonment as follows:
15 (a) If the offense for which he or she presently stands convicted is a Class A or
16 Class B felony, or if the person was previously convicted of one (1) or more
17 sex crimes committed against a minor as defined in KRS 17.500 and presently
18 stands convicted of a subsequent sex crime, a persistent felony offender in the
19 first degree shall be sentenced to an indeterminate term of imprisonment, the
20 maximum of which shall not be less than twenty (20) years nor more than
21 fifty (50) years, or life imprisonment, or life imprisonment without parole for
22 twenty-five (25) years for a sex crime committed against a minor;
23 (b) If the offense for which he or she presently stands convicted is a Class C or
24 Class D felony, a persistent felony offender in the first degree shall be
25 sentenced to an indeterminate term of imprisonment, the maximum of which

1 be eligible for probation, shock probation, or conditional discharge, unless all
2 offenses for which the person stands convicted are Class D felony offenses which
3 do not involve a violent act against a person or a sex crime as that term is defined in
4 KRS 17.500, in which case, probation, shock probation, or conditional discharge
5 may be granted. If the offense the person presently stands convicted of is a Class A,

7 a minimum term of incarceration of not less than ten (10) years, unless another
8 sentencing scheme applies. A violent offender who is found to be a persistent

12 the application of this section, regardless of the number or type of prior felony
13 convictions that may have been entered against the defendant. A conviction, plea of
14 guilty, or Alford plea under KRS 218A.1415 may be used as a prior felony offense
15 allowing this section to be applied if he or she is subsequently convicted of a
16 different felony offense.
17 (9) The provisions of this section amended by 1994 Ky. Acts ch. 396, sec. 11, shall be
18 retroactive.
19 (10) (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, this section shall not
20 apply to a person convicted of a criminal offense if the penalty for that offense
21 was increased from a misdemeanor to a felony, or from a lower felony
22 classification to a higher felony classification, because the conviction
23 constituted a second or subsequent violation of that offense.
24 (b) This subsection shall not prohibit the application of this section to a person
25 convicted of:
26 1. A felony offense arising out of KRS 189A.010, 189A.090, 506.140,
27 508.032, 508.140, or 510.015; or

1 2. Any other felony offense if the penalty was not enhanced to a higher
2 level because the Commonwealth elected to prosecute the person as a
3 first-time violator of that offense.
4 (11) The enhancement of a sentence pursuant to this section shall not alter the felony
5 classification of the conviction.
