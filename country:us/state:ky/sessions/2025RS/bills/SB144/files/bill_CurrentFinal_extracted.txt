25 shall be disposed of as provided in this section. It shall be the duty of all peace
26 officers and other public officers or officials having knowledge of the lawful owner
27 or claimant of property subject to forfeiture to report the same to the trial court

1 may be sold or retained for official use as provided in this section, the court shall
2 cause a serial or other identifying number to be placed thereon, and a record of the
3 number assigned shall be placed in the court order authorizing the sale or retention
4 of the property. This number shall be assigned, whenever applicable, in consultation
5 with the Department of Kentucky State Police and any other state or federal
6 regulatory agency. The purchaser of the property shall be given a document stating
7 that the property had been forfeited pursuant to law and that a number, shown on
8 the document, has been assigned which shall be deemed as compliance of the owner
9 with KRS 514.120. When property is returned to an owner pursuant to this section
10 and its identity has been obscured by another person in violation of KRS 514.120,
11 the court shall provide a document to the owner relieving him or her of liability for
12 its continued possession. This document shall serve as evidence of compliance with
13 KRS 514.120 by the owner or any person to whom he or she lawfully disposes of

17 (7) Before forfeiture of any property under this section, it shall be the duty of the trial
18 court to determine if a lawful owner or claimant to the property has been identified
19 or is identifiable. If a lawful owner or claimant has been identified or is identifiable,
20 the court shall notify the owner or claimant that the property is being held and
21 specify a reasonable period of time during which the claim may be made or may, in
22 lieu thereof, order the return of the property to the lawful owner or claimant. If the
23 lawful owner or claimant does not assert his or her claim to the property after
24 notification or if he or she renounces his or her claim to the property, the property
25 shall be disposed of as provided in this section. It shall be the duty of all peace
26 officers and other public officers or officials having knowledge of the lawful owner
27 or claimant of property subject to forfeiture to report the same to the trial court

14 course of nine hundred twenty-eight (928) hours' duration within one (1)
15 year of the date of employment at a school certified or recognized by the

18 prior to the date on which the officer's police department was included
19 as a participant under KRS 15.410 to 15.510 shall be deemed to have
20 met the requirements of this subsection.
21 2. As the exclusive method by which the number of hours required for
22 basic training courses shall be modified from that which is specifically
23 established by this paragraph, the council may, by the promulgation of
24 administrative regulations in accordance with the provisions of KRS

8 pursuant to its authority under KRS 15.330, from approving training
9 schools with a curriculum requiring attendance of a number of hours
10 that exceeds nine hundred twenty-eight (928) hours or the number of

13 programs and schools for the basic training of law enforcement
14 personnel conducted by the department pursuant to KRS 15A.070 shall
15 not contain a curriculum that requires attendance of a number of hours
16 for basic training that is different from nine hundred twenty-eight (928)
17 hours or the number of hours established in an administrative regulation
18 promulgated by the council pursuant to the provisions of KRS Chapter
19 13A as provided by subparagraphs 2. and 3. of this paragraph.
20 5. KRS 15.400 and 15.404(1) and subparagraphs 1. to 4. of this paragraph
21 to the contrary notwithstanding, the council may, through the
22 promulgation of administrative regulations in accordance with KRS
