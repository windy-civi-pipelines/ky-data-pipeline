18 legislative council more than one hundred twenty (120) days next preceding
19 the next regularly scheduled election day within the county.
20 The boundaries so described in either case shall not cross precinct lines. The
21 question of whether the area bounded as described should be added to or deleted
22 from, as the case may be, the urban service tax district shall then be placed upon the

24 and the question stated on the ballot shall be so phrased that a "Yes" vote shall be
25 cast in favor of making the proposed change and a "No" vote shall be cast to oppose
26 the proposed change. If a majority of those voting in those precincts support the
27 change, then the change in the boundaries of the urban service tax district shall be
