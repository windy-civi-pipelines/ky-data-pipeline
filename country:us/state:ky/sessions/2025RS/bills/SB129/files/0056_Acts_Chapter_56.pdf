hundred thirty-five (135) days after the unpaid tax claims are filed by the sheriff with the county

3. A county clerk who:
a. Due to the assessment schedule established by the department, anticipates receiving
certificates of delinquency relating to unmined coal, oil, or gas reserves, or any other
mineral or energy resources assessed separately from the surface real property pursuant to

established by subparagraph 2. of this paragraph; and

manner to allow one (1) third party to purchase all of the certificates of delinquency if there are
other properly registered third parties that are also interested in purchasing certificates of
delinquency;

or multiple individuals representing related interests as separate entities in the selection process
at an annual sale. The department shall define "related entities" and "related interests" as part of

Section 8. KRS 67C.147 is amended to read as follows:
(1) In order to maintain the tax structure, tax rates, or level of services in the area of the consolidated local
government formerly comprising the city of the first class, the legislative council of a consolidated local
government may provide in the manner described in this chapter for taxes and services within the area
comprising the former city of the first class which are different from the taxes and services which are
applicable in the remainder of the county. These differences may include differences in tax rates upon the class
of property which includes the surface of the land, differences in ad valorem tax rates upon personal property,
and differences in tax rates upon insurance premiums.
(2) Any difference in the ad valorem tax rate on the class of property which includes the surface of the land in the
portion of the county formerly comprising the city of the first class and in the portion of the county other than
that formerly comprising the city of the first class may be imposed directly by the consolidated local
government council. Any change in these ad valorem tax rates shall comply with KRS 68.245, 132.010,
132.017, and 132.027 and shall be used for services as provided by KRS 82.085.
(3) If the consolidated local government council determines to provide for tax rates applicable to health insurance
premiums and personal property which are different in the area formerly comprising the city of the first class
than the rates applicable in the remainder of the county, it shall do so in the following manner. The
consolidated local government council shall by ordinance create a tax district to be known as the "urban
service tax district" bounded by the former boundaries of the former city of the first class. The ordinance shall
designate the number of members of the board of this tax district and the manner in which they shall be
appointed. The ordinance shall provide that the board of the tax district shall receive the income derived from
the differential tax rate applicable in the area formerly comprising the city of the first class with respect to
personal property, health insurance premiums, or both, and shall contract with the consolidated local
government to pay all sums collected to the consolidated local government, in return for the provision of
services performed by the consolidated local government within the area formerly comprising the city of the
first class which services are in addition to services performed by the consolidated local government in the
remainder of the county. The consolidated local government shall provide at least an annual reporting to the
urban service tax district board and the legislative body of the consolidated local government containing but
not limited to detailed operating and capital expenditures of each service performed by the consolidated local
government.
(4) After the initial formation of an urban service tax district in a consolidated local government, the boundaries of
the district may be modified in the following manner. The proposal to alter the boundaries of the urban service
tax district within a consolidated local government may be initiated by:
(a) A resolution enacted by the consolidated local government describing the boundaries of the area to be
added to or deleted from the tax district and duly passed and signed by the mayor not less than one
hundred twenty (120) days before the next regularly scheduled election day within the county; or
(b) A petition signed by a number of qualified voters living within precincts within the area to be added to
or deleted from the tax district equal to ten percent (10%) of the votes cast within each precinct in the
last general election for President of the United States and delivered to the clerk of the legislative
council more than one hundred twenty (120) days next preceding the next regularly scheduled election
day within the county.
The boundaries so described in either case shall not cross precinct lines. The question of whether the area
bounded as described should be added to or deleted from, as the case may be, the urban service tax district
shall then be placed upon the ballot in the precincts in the area to be added or deleted at the next regular
election and the question stated on the ballot shall be so phrased that a "Yes" vote shall be cast in favor of
making the proposed change and a "No" vote shall be cast to oppose the proposed change. If a majority of
those voting in those precincts support the change, then the change in the boundaries of the urban service tax
district shall be implemented.
(5) (a) No later than July 1, 2025, the consolidated local government shall reimburse a fire district operating
under KRS Chapter 75 for expenses related to each emergency medical response made by the fire
district operating under KRS Chapter 75 into the area of the urban service tax district. A fire district so

transporting a person and one hundred fifty dollars ($150) for arriving at person's location when no
person is transported.
(b) The payment established in paragraph (a) of this subsection shall be in addition to any insurance
moneys the fire district may be eligible to receive resulting from the response.

the percentage increase in the nonseasonally adjusted annual average Consumer Price Index for All
Urban Consumers (CPI-U), U.S. City Average, All Items, between the two (2) most recent calendar
years available, as published by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics.
(d) The consolidated local government shall not charge a fire district operating under KRS Chapter 75 for
any expenses or services that the consolidated local government was not charging the fire district prior
to January 1, 2024.
(6) Except for services provided within the central business district as defined by the consolidated local
government via ordinance as of April 1, 2024:
(a) From July 1, 2025, to June 30, 2028, the differential tax received by the urban service tax district shall
fund no less than eighty-five percent (85%) of all costs related to the services provided, including
capital expenditures related to the services, within the urban service tax district by the consolidated
local government as set out in this section that are in addition to the services performed by the
consolidated local government in the remainder of the county;[.]
(b) From July 1, 2028, to June 30, 2031, the differential tax received by the urban service tax district shall

government as set out in this section that are in addition to the services performed by the consolidated
local government in the remainder of the county;[.]
(c) From July 1, 2031, to June 30, 2034, the differential tax received by the urban service tax district shall

(d) After June 30, 2034, the differential tax received by the urban service tax district shall fund no less than
one hundred percent (100%) of all costs related to the services provided, including capital expenditures
related to the services, within the urban service tax district by the consolidated local government as set
out in this section that are in addition to the services performed by the consolidated local government in
the remainder of the county.
