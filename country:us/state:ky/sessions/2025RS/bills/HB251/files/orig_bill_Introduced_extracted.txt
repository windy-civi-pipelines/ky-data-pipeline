UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 879
2 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
3 Section 1. KRS 158.840 is amended to read as follows:
4 (1) The General Assembly hereby finds that reading and mathematics proficiency are
5 gateway skills necessary for all Kentucky students to achieve the academic goals
6 established in KRS 158.6451. It is the General Assembly's intent that:
7 (a) All students in kindergarten through grade three (3) having difficulty in
8 reading and mathematics receive early diagnosis and intervention services
9 from highly trained teachers;
10 (b) All students in kindergarten through grade three (3) needing to make
11 accelerated progress toward proficiency in mathematics based on data from
12 valid and reliable universal screening and diagnostic assessments receive
13 high-quality, evidence-based mathematics instruction and intervention aligned
14 to the Kentucky academic standards for mathematics;
15 (c) All students demonstrate proficiency in reading and mathematics as they
16 progress through the relevant curricula and complete each assessment level
17 required by the Kentucky Board of Education for the state assessment
18 program established under KRS 158.6453 and in compliance with the
19 requirements of the federal Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015, Pub. L. No.
20 114-95, or its successor; and
21 (d) Students who are struggling in reading and mathematics or are not at the
22 proficient level on statewide assessments shall be provided evidence-based
23 and developmentally appropriate diagnostic and intervention services, and
24 instructional modifications necessary to learn.
25 The General Assembly, the Kentucky Board of Education, the Kentucky
26 Department of Education, the Council on Postsecondary Education, colleges and

1 teachers, parents and families, and other educational entities, such as the Education
2 Professional Standards Board, P-16 councils, the statewide reading research center
3 established under KRS 164.0207, and the Center for Middle School Academic
4 Achievement must collaborate if the intentions specified in this subsection are to be
5 met. Intensive focus on student achievement in reading and mathematics does not
6 negate the responsibility of any entity to help students obtain proficiency in other
7 core curriculum content areas.
8 (2) The General Assembly's role is to set policies that address the achievement levels of
9 all students and provide resources for the professional growth of teachers and
10 administrators, assessing students' academic achievement, including valid and
11 reliable universal screening and diagnostic assessment and instructional
12 interventions, technology innovations, targeted reading and mathematics statewide
13 initiatives, research and the distribution of research findings, services for students
14 beyond the regular school day, and other services needed to help struggling
15 learners.
16 (3) The Kentucky Board of Education shall regularly review and modify, when
17 appropriate, its statewide assessment policies and practices to enable local school
18 districts and schools to carry out the provisions of the statewide assessment and
19 accountability system, required under KRS 158.6453 to improve student
20 achievement in mathematics and reading.
21 (4) The Kentucky Department of Education shall:
22 (a) Provide assistance to schools and teachers, including publicizing professional
23 development opportunities, methods of measuring effective professional
24 development, the availability of high quality instructional materials, and
25 developmentally appropriate, valid, and reliable screening and diagnostic
26 assessments of student competency in mathematics and reading. The
27 department shall provide access to samples of units of study, annotated

1 student work, diagnostic instruments, and research findings, and give
2 guidance on parental engagement;
3 (b) Work with state and national educators and subject-matter experts to identify
4 student reading and mathematical skills in each subject area that align with the
5 state content standards adopted under KRS 158.6453 and identify teaching
6 strategies in each subject area that can be used explicitly to develop the
7 identified reading and mathematical skills under this paragraph;
8 (c) Encourage the development of comprehensive middle and high school
9 adolescent reading and mathematics plans to be incorporated into the curricula
10 of each subject area to improve the reading comprehension and mathematical
11 skills of all students;
12 (d) Conduct an annual review of the state grant programs it manages and make
13 recommendations, when needed, to the Interim Joint Committee on Education
14 for changes to statutory requirements that are necessary to gain a greater
15 return on investment;
16 (e) Provide administrative support and oversight to programs to train classroom
17 coaches and mentors to help teachers with reading and mathematics
18 instruction; and
19 (f) Require no reporting of instructional plans, formative assessment results, staff
20 effectiveness processes, or interventions implemented in the classroom,
21 except for:
22 1. Interventions implemented under KRS 158.305(2) and 158.8402;
23 2. Funds provided under KRS 158.792 or 158.844; or
24 3. Schools that are identified for comprehensive support and improvement
25 and fail to exit comprehensive support and improvement status after
26 three (3) consecutive years of implementing the turnaround intervention
27 process as described in KRS 160.346.
