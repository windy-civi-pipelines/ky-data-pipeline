1 Rule 8. Order of Questions. All questions, whether in Committee of the Whole
2 or in the Senate, when not a privileged question, shall be propounded in the order in
3 which they were moved, except that in filling blanks the smallest sum and the most
4 remote date shall be put first.
5 Rule 9. Precedence of Motions. When a question is under consideration, no
6 motion shall be in order except:
7 1. To call the Senate when there is no quorum present.
8 2. To fix the time to which the Senate shall adjourn.
9 3. To adjourn.
10 4. To take recess.
11 5. To lay on the table.
12 6. For the previous question.
13 7. To limit or extend limits of debate.
14 8. To postpone to a fixed time.
15 9. To lay on the Clerk’s desk.
16 10. To refer or commit.
17 11. To amend.
18 12. To postpone indefinitely.
19 The above several motions shall have precedence in the order in which they are
20 arranged and the first seven of them shall not be debatable.
21 A second motion to adjourn, to take a recess, to lay on the table, for the previous
22 question, to limit or extend limits of debate, to postpone to a time certain, to lay on the
23 Clerk’s desk, to refer or commit or to postpone indefinitely shall not be in order on the
24 same day, upon the same question, and at the same status unless other business
25 intervenes; provided, however, that amendments may be made to the time to which it is
26 proposed to adjourn, to take a recess or to postpone to a fixed time.
27 Rule 10. Motion to Adjourn. A motion to adjourn, to take a recess, or a motion
Page 4 of 40

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 808
1 to adjourn to a time certain, shall always be in order, except when a Senator is speaking,
2 while a vote is being taken, or when the Committee on Committees is reporting; subject,
3 however, to the limitations set out in Rule 9.
4 Rule 11. Motion to Table. The adoption of the motion to table, under these rules,
5 defeats the subject matter under consideration. The reconsideration of the motion to table
6 shall require approval of a majority of the members elected.
7 Rule 12. Previous Question. When the previous question has been ordered, a
8 vote shall be taken immediately upon the pending measure and any pending amendments
9 as are in order. The effect of the previous question shall be to put an end to all debate, to
10 prevent the offering of additional amendments and to bring the Senate to an immediate
11 vote upon the measure and amendments aforesaid. The previous question may be ordered
12 by a majority of the Senators elected. On the call of the roll, no Senator shall be allowed
13 to speak more than three minutes to explain a vote and shall not speak at all if the
14 question is not a debatable question.[ After the previous question has been ordered, and
15 before the vote upon the main question, the opponents of the measure shall have ten
16 minutes, and proponents of the measure shall have ten minutes.]
17 Rule 13. Motion to Set the Limits of Debate. A motion to extend a time limit
18 for debate on a measure beyond that permitted under Rule 12 shall be in order unless the
19 previous question shall have been ordered on the measure. The time limit set for debate
20 under this rule shall be allotted by the President evenly between the opponents of the
21 measure and the proponents of the measure. Adoption of a motion under this rule does
22 not prevent the offering of additional amendments.
23 Rule 14. Motion to Reconsider. A motion to reconsider a vote shall not be in
24 order unless made by a Senator who voted upon the prevailing side of the question; nor
25 shall that motion be in order unless made within two legislative days in which the Senate
26 is in session next after the day the vote was taken; however, the motion to reconsider
27 when coupled with the additional motion to lay that motion upon the table may be made

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 808
1 by any Senator. A motion to reconsider a vote on a bill or resolution not in the possession
2 of the Senate shall not be in order.
3 Rule 15. Motion to Lay on Clerk’s Desk. The effect of the adoption of a motion
4 to lay on the Clerk’s desk under these rules is to place in charge of the Clerk the pending
5 question and everything adhering to it. A motion laid on the Clerk’s desk may be taken
6 from the desk and proceeded with at any time in the same order as when laid on the
7 Clerk’s desk.
8 Rule 16. Motion to Strike Out Enacting Clause. A motion to amend by striking
9 out the enacting words of a bill or resolution shall have precedence over a motion to
10 amend, and, if adopted, shall have the same effect as though the bill or resolution were
11 regularly voted upon and rejected.
12 Rule 17. Motion to Separate Part of a Measure. A motion to commit,
13 recommit, or postpone a part of a measure so as to separate that part of the measure from
14 the remainder shall not be in order.
15 Rule 18. Postponement of Measures. When a measure shall have been
16 postponed indefinitely it shall not be in order again during the session.
17 Rule 19. Reading of Pending Papers. Any pending bill, resolution, motion or
18 report shall be read by the Clerk upon the demand of any Senator, but it shall not again be
19 read on the same day unless so ordered by the Senate.
20 Rule 20. Nominations. In all elections a previous nomination shall be made.
21 MEMBERS

23 the Senate without leave from the Senate.
24 Rule 22. Decorum of Members. No Senator shall designate another Senator by
25 name. Members shall wear appropriate professional business attire while on the floor of
26 the Senate.

Page 6 of 40
XXXX 1/3/2025 1:30 PM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 808
1 rules of order or decorum, the Senator shall immediately be called to order by the chair
2 and shall be seated. The Clerk shall reduce the objectionable words to writing and read
3 them to the Senate. After hearing a short explanation from the Senator called to order, or
4 upon the withdrawal of the objectionable language, the President may permit the Senator
5 to proceed, or may require the Senator’s silence until the matter is disposed of. The ruling
6 of the chair shall be subject to an appeal to the Senate. A Senator offending the Senate
7 shall be liable to censure.
8 Rule 24. Debate. No Senator may speak more than once to the same subject until
9 all Senators desiring to be heard have spoken, but nothing in this rule shall do away with
10 the previous question if then in effect, nor permit debate on an undebatable motion.
11 No Senator shall speak more than fifteen minutes in the aggregate on any question
12 or measure, including debate on amendments and explanation of the member's vote. No
13 Senator shall be allowed to speak more than three minutes to explain a vote. At the end of
14 a member's allotted time, or any portion thereof, the floor shall be returned to the
15 President.
16 Rule 25. Members Shall Vote at Seats. A Senator shall vote only when at the
17 Senator’s seat or visibly approaching it.

19 Rule 26. President. On the first day of the Regular Session in an odd-numbered
20 year, or at any time there is a vacancy in the office of President, immediately following
21 the adoption of the Rules, the President of the Senate shall take the chair to receive
22 nominations from the floor and to preside over the election of the President. The member
23 who receives the votes of a majority of the members elected shall be the President. If
24 there is more than one nominee, the election of each nominee shall be treated as an
25 alternative proposition, with each name being put to the Senate in the order in which
26 nominated. The first nominee receiving the votes of a majority of those elected to the
27 Senate shall be declared elected. If no member receives the votes of a majority of the
Page 7 of 40

1 members elected, the election is of no effect.

3 meeting of the Senate and shall call the Senate to order and direct the Clerk to call the
4 roll, whereupon, if there is a quorum present, the Order of Business shall be followed.

11 The President may designate any Senator to preside in the absence of both the
12 President and President Pro Tem and to perform all duties of the President, including

14 may be made from time to time or for any period of time as the President may designate.
15 Rule 27. Appeal from Decision of Chair. The President while presiding may
16 speak to points of order in preference to Senators. The President shall decide points of
17 order and manner of procedure. If two or more Senators arise from their respective seats
18 and address the chair, the President shall determine who was first and recognize that
19 Senator.
20 Any decision made by the President shall be subject to appeal to the Senate. During
21 the pendency of any appeal to the Senate from a decision of the chair, the President shall
22 vacate the chair and call the President Pro Tem to preside. When the President Pro Tem is
23 presiding on an appeal to the Senate from a decision of the President, no motion or
24 business shall be in order except the motion on appeal from the decision of the President,
25 and that motion shall not be debatable. Upon an appeal, the question put to the Senate
26 shall be stated as follows: "Shall the decision of the President stand as the judgment of
27 the Senate? An ‘Aye’ vote shall support the President’s ruling, and a ‘Nay’ vote shall

15 members who have dissented from the committee’s report; it shall be in order to move
16 the adoption of the minority report as a substitute for the committee’s report when the

22 determine if the committee has held the bill for an unreasonable time, call the petition for
23 consideration on the next succeeding legislative day after its filing. The petition is
24 deemed filed when it is read into the record by the Clerk of the Senate. If a majority of
25 the members elected to the Senate concur that the bill has been held an unreasonable time
26 by voting to approve the petition, the bill shall be considered as though it had been
27 regularly reported and shall be given its first reading and thereafter treated as any other

9 Orders. Bills receiving a second reading should be so designated to distinguish them from
10 bills which have already received their second reading.
11 (4) A certificate shall be attached to each bill recommended for the Consent
12 Calendar, showing the request of the sponsor of any Senate Bill, and the unanimous

1 of any bill introduced during the session, the staff of the Legislative Research
2 Commission shall identify the amendment. When a question is raised as to the identity of
3 a proposed amendment containing the substantial text of any other bill introduced during
4 the session which has not passed the Senate, the President shall rule thereon, subject to

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 808
1 Rule 8. Order of Questions. All questions, whether in Committee of the Whole
2 or in the Senate, when not a privileged question, shall be propounded in the order in
3 which they were moved, except that in filling blanks the smallest sum and the most
4 remote date shall be put first.
5 Rule 9. Precedence of Motions. When a question is under consideration, no
6 motion shall be in order except:
7 1. To call the Senate when there is no quorum present.
8 2. To fix the time to which the Senate shall adjourn.
9 3. To adjourn.
10 4. To take recess.
11 5. To lay on the table.
12 6. For the previous question.
13 7. To limit or extend limits of debate.
14 8. To postpone to a fixed time.
15 9. To lay on the Clerk’s desk.
16 10. To refer or commit.
17 11. To amend.
18 12. To postpone indefinitely.
19 The above several motions shall have precedence in the order in which they are
20 arranged and the first seven of them shall not be debatable.
21 A second motion to adjourn, to take a recess, to lay on the table, for the previous
22 question, to limit or extend limits of debate, to postpone to a time certain, to lay on the
23 Clerk’s desk, to refer or commit or to postpone indefinitely shall not be in order on the
24 same day, upon the same question, and at the same status unless other business
25 intervenes; provided, however, that amendments may be made to the time to which it is
26 proposed to adjourn, to take a recess or to postpone to a fixed time.
27 Rule 10. Motion to Adjourn. A motion to adjourn, to take a recess, or a motion
Page 4 of 40

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 808
1 to adjourn to a time certain, shall always be in order, except when a Senator is speaking,
2 while a vote is being taken, or when the Committee on Committees is reporting; subject,
3 however, to the limitations set out in Rule 9.
4 Rule 11. Motion to Table. The adoption of the motion to table, under these rules,
5 defeats the subject matter under consideration. The reconsideration of the motion to table
6 shall require approval of a majority of the members elected.
7 Rule 12. Previous Question. When the previous question has been ordered, a
8 vote shall be taken immediately upon the pending measure and any pending amendments
9 as are in order. The effect of the previous question shall be to put an end to all debate, to
10 prevent the offering of additional amendments and to bring the Senate to an immediate
11 vote upon the measure and amendments aforesaid. The previous question may be ordered
12 by a majority of the Senators elected. On the call of the roll, no Senator shall be allowed
13 to speak more than three minutes to explain a vote and shall not speak at all if the
14 question is not a debatable question.[ After the previous question has been ordered, and
15 before the vote upon the main question, the opponents of the measure shall have ten
16 minutes, and proponents of the measure shall have ten minutes.]
17 Rule 13. Motion to Set the Limits of Debate. A motion to extend a time limit
18 for debate on a measure beyond that permitted under Rule 12 shall be in order unless the
19 previous question shall have been ordered on the measure. The time limit set for debate
20 under this rule shall be allotted by the President evenly between the opponents of the
21 measure and the proponents of the measure. Adoption of a motion under this rule does
22 not prevent the offering of additional amendments.
23 Rule 14. Motion to Reconsider. A motion to reconsider a vote shall not be in
24 order unless made by a Senator who voted upon the prevailing side of the question; nor
25 shall that motion be in order unless made within two legislative days in which the Senate
26 is in session next after the day the vote was taken; however, the motion to reconsider
27 when coupled with the additional motion to lay that motion upon the table may be made
Page 5 of 40

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 808
1 by any Senator. A motion to reconsider a vote on a bill or resolution not in the possession
2 of the Senate shall not be in order.
3 Rule 15. Motion to Lay on Clerk’s Desk. The effect of the adoption of a motion
4 to lay on the Clerk’s desk under these rules is to place in charge of the Clerk the pending
5 question and everything adhering to it. A motion laid on the Clerk’s desk may be taken
6 from the desk and proceeded with at any time in the same order as when laid on the
7 Clerk’s desk.
8 Rule 16. Motion to Strike Out Enacting Clause. A motion to amend by striking
9 out the enacting words of a bill or resolution shall have precedence over a motion to
10 amend, and, if adopted, shall have the same effect as though the bill or resolution were
11 regularly voted upon and rejected.
12 Rule 17. Motion to Separate Part of a Measure. A motion to commit,
13 recommit, or postpone a part of a measure so as to separate that part of the measure from
14 the remainder shall not be in order.
15 Rule 18. Postponement of Measures. When a measure shall have been
16 postponed indefinitely it shall not be in order again during the session.
17 Rule 19. Reading of Pending Papers. Any pending bill, resolution, motion or
18 report shall be read by the Clerk upon the demand of any Senator, but it shall not again be
19 read on the same day unless so ordered by the Senate.
20 Rule 20. Nominations. In all elections a previous nomination shall be made.
21 MEMBERS
22 Rule 21. Attendance of Members. No Senator shall be absent from a session of
23 the Senate without leave from the Senate.
24 Rule 22. Decorum of Members. No Senator shall designate another Senator by
25 name. Members shall wear appropriate professional business attire while on the floor of
26 the Senate.
27 Rule 23. Call to Order. If any Senator, in speech or otherwise, transgresses the
Page 6 of 40
XXXX 1/3/2025 1:30 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 808
1 rules of order or decorum, the Senator shall immediately be called to order by the chair
2 and shall be seated. The Clerk shall reduce the objectionable words to writing and read
3 them to the Senate. After hearing a short explanation from the Senator called to order, or
4 upon the withdrawal of the objectionable language, the President may permit the Senator
5 to proceed, or may require the Senator’s silence until the matter is disposed of. The ruling
6 of the chair shall be subject to an appeal to the Senate. A Senator offending the Senate
7 shall be liable to censure.
8 Rule 24. Debate. No Senator may speak more than once to the same subject until
9 all Senators desiring to be heard have spoken, but nothing in this rule shall do away with
10 the previous question if then in effect, nor permit debate on an undebatable motion.
11 No Senator shall speak more than fifteen minutes in the aggregate on any question
12 or measure, including debate on amendments and explanation of the member's vote. No
13 Senator shall be allowed to speak more than three minutes to explain a vote. At the end of
14 a member's allotted time, or any portion thereof, the floor shall be returned to the
15 President.
16 Rule 25. Members Shall Vote at Seats. A Senator shall vote only when at the
17 Senator’s seat or visibly approaching it.
18 OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES
19 Rule 26. President. On the first day of the Regular Session in an odd-numbered
20 year, or at any time there is a vacancy in the office of President, immediately following
21 the adoption of the Rules, the President of the Senate shall take the chair to receive
22 nominations from the floor and to preside over the election of the President. The member
23 who receives the votes of a majority of the members elected shall be the President. If
24 there is more than one nominee, the election of each nominee shall be treated as an
25 alternative proposition, with each name being put to the Senate in the order in which
26 nominated. The first nominee receiving the votes of a majority of those elected to the
27 Senate shall be declared elected. If no member receives the votes of a majority of the
Page 7 of 40

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 808
1 members elected, the election is of no effect.
2 The President shall take the chair every day precisely at the hour fixed for the
3 meeting of the Senate and shall call the Senate to order and direct the Clerk to call the
4 roll, whereupon, if there is a quorum present, the Order of Business shall be followed.
5 The President shall preserve decorum and order and, in the event of any disorder in
6 the gallery or in the Senate Chamber, may cause the same to be cleared of any persons
7 creating disturbances or disorders.
8 All writs, warrants, subpoenas or other processes shall be signed by the officer who
9 may be presiding over the Senate when the paper is issued; and the officer’s signature
10 shall be attested by the Clerk, when ordered by a majority of the Senators.
11 The President may designate any Senator to preside in the absence of both the
12 President and President Pro Tem and to perform all duties of the President, including
13 duties as a member of the Committee on Committees. This designation by the President
14 may be made from time to time or for any period of time as the President may designate.
15 Rule 27. Appeal from Decision of Chair. The President while presiding may
16 speak to points of order in preference to Senators. The President shall decide points of
17 order and manner of procedure. If two or more Senators arise from their respective seats
18 and address the chair, the President shall determine who was first and recognize that
19 Senator.
20 Any decision made by the President shall be subject to appeal to the Senate. During
21 the pendency of any appeal to the Senate from a decision of the chair, the President shall
22 vacate the chair and call the President Pro Tem to preside. When the President Pro Tem is
23 presiding on an appeal to the Senate from a decision of the President, no motion or
24 business shall be in order except the motion on appeal from the decision of the President,
25 and that motion shall not be debatable. Upon an appeal, the question put to the Senate
26 shall be stated as follows: "Shall the decision of the President stand as the judgment of
27 the Senate? An ‘Aye’ vote shall support the President’s ruling, and a ‘Nay’ vote shall

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 808
1 oppose the President’s ruling." The ruling of the President shall be sustained unless a
2 majority of the members elected to the Senate oppose the ruling.
3 Rule 28. President Pro Tempore. The Senate shall elect a President Pro Tem,
4 who shall perform the duties of the President when the President is absent from the
5 Senate, or when empowered by the President to perform the duties of the chair.
6 Rule 29. Duties of Clerk. The Clerk shall have charge and supervision of all the
7 clerical business of the Senate. The Clerk shall have charge of the Clerk’s section of the
8 Senate Chamber and shall see that no one is permitted therein except the Clerk and those
9 assisting the Clerk.
10 The Clerk shall read to the Senate papers ordered to be read; call the roll and note
11 and report the absentees when a call of the Senate is ordered; call the roll and note the
12 answers of members when a question is taken by yeas and nays; assist the President in
13 taking the count when any vote of the Senate is taken; notify committees of their
14 appointment and business referred to them; attest all writs, warrants and subpoenas issued
15 by order of the Senate; keep a calendar indicating bills entitled to their second reading
16 each day, distinguishing between House and Senate bills; superintend the engrossing and
17 enrolling of bills; certify to the passage of all bills and to the adoption of all joint and
18 concurrent resolutions by the General Assembly; and make all reports to the House,
19 unless otherwise ordered.
20 Rule 30. Journal of Proceedings. The Clerk shall cause to be kept the Journal of
21 the proceedings of the Senate. The Clerk shall note upon the Journal all questions of
22 order, together with the disposition of same, and the dates upon which all bills and
23 resolutions were sent to committee and returned to the Senate. The Senate may correct
24 errors in the Journal the day the Journal containing errors is presented to the Senate. No
25 record which is in the hands of the Clerk and is required by law to be entered upon the
26 Journal of the Senate shall be copied by any person until same shall have been entered
27 upon the Journal and said Journal shall have been approved. Half an hour before the time

2 the Clerk’s desk with the journal of the preceding session for the inspection of any

4 The Clerk shall transmit the Journal for each day as soon as it has been approved by
5 the Senate to the Legislative Research Commission, which shall deliver it to the public
6 printer. The Commission staff shall proofread and index the Journal upon return from the
7 printer and make necessary typographical corrections.
8 Rule 31. Custody of Papers. The Clerk shall have custody of all records, papers
9 and bills of the Senate and shall not allow them to be taken out of the Clerk’s possession
10 without the leave of the Senate, unless to be delivered to the chairman of a committee to
11 which they have been referred or to the Legislative Research Commission, as specified in
12 these rules, and then the Clerk shall take a proper receipt therefor. The Clerk shall
13 endorse on bills and papers brief notes of proceedings had thereon by the Senate and
14 preserve the same in convenient files for reference. The Director of the Legislative
15 Research Commission shall implement a policy to provide for the maintenance and
16 distribution of the records, papers, and bills of the legislative branch.

2 announce in a loud distinct voice: "All persons not entitled to the floor of the Senate

4 then compel all persons who are not entitled to remain therein to leave the Senate
5 Chamber and shall prohibit their entry until thirty minutes after the Senate has adjourned.
6 The Sergeant-at-Arms of the Senate, before any joint session is to be held, shall
7 request the Sergeant-at-Arms of the House to arrange for the seating of the members of
