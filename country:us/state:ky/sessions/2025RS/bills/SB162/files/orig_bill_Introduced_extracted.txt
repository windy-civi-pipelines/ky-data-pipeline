5 (1) Any person suspected of fraudulently obtaining or attempting to obtain any
6 benefit under this chapter, or under any unemployment insurance law of any
7 other state or the federal government, shall be referred by the cabinet to the
8 United States Department of Justice, the Kentucky Justice and Public Safety

4 Section 2. KRS 341.370 is amended to read as follows:
5 (1) A worker shall be disqualified from receiving benefits for the duration of any
6 period of unemployment with respect to which:
7 (a) He or she has failed without good cause either to apply for available, suitable
8 work when so directed by the employment office or the secretary, to accept an
9 interview from a prospective employer offering suitable work, or to accept
10 suitable work when offered him or her, or to return to his or her customary
11 self-employment when so directed by the secretary;
12 (b) He or she has been discharged for misconduct or dishonesty connected with
13 his or her most recent work, or from any work which occurred after the first
14 day of the worker's base period and which last preceded his or her most recent
15 work, but legitimate activity in connection with labor organizations or failure
16 to join a company union shall not be construed as misconduct;
17 (c) He or she has left his or her most recent suitable work or any other suitable
18 work which occurred after the first day of the worker's base period and which
19 last preceded his or her most recent work voluntarily without good cause
20 attributable to the employment. No otherwise eligible worker shall be
21 disqualified from receiving benefits for:
22 1. Leaving his or her next most recent suitable work which was concurrent
23 with his or her most recent work;
24 2. Leaving work which is one hundred (100) road miles or more, as

27 3. Accepting work which is a bona fide job offer with a reasonable
Page 2 of 8

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1578
1 expectation of continued employment; or
2 4. Leaving work to accompany the worker's spouse to a different state,
3 military base of assignment, or duty station that is one hundred (100)

6 (d) He or she fails to act in good faith to secure suitable work.
7 (2) A worker shall be disqualified from receiving benefits for any week with respect to
8 which he or she knowingly made a false statement to establish his or her right to or
9 the amount of his or her benefits, and, within the succeeding twenty-four (24)
10 months, for the additional weeks immediately following the date of discovery, not
11 to exceed a total of fifty-two (52), as may be determined by the secretary.
12 (3) A worker shall be disqualified from receiving benefits for any week that he or she
13 is under investigation for knowingly making a false statement or representation
14 of material fact to obtain or increase his or her benefits. The disqualification

16 that a fraudulent act did not occur.
17 (4)[(3)] No worker shall be disqualified under paragraph (b) or (c) of subsection (1) of
18 this section unless the employer, within a reasonable time as prescribed by
19 regulations promulgated by the secretary, notifies the cabinet and the worker in
20 writing of the alleged voluntary quitting or the discharge for misconduct. Nothing
21 in this subsection shall restrict the right of the secretary to disqualify a worker
22 whose employer has refused or failed to notify the Education and Labor Cabinet of
23 the alleged voluntary quitting or discharge for misconduct, if the alleged voluntary
24 quitting or discharge for misconduct is known to the secretary prior to the time
25 benefits are paid to the worker. The exercise of the right by the secretary, in the
26 absence of timely notice from the employer, shall not relieve the employer's reserve

4 worker's base period and which last preceded the week of unemployment with
5 respect to which benefits are claimed; except that, if the work last preceding the
6 week of unemployment was seasonal, intermittent, or temporary in nature, most
7 recent work may be construed as that work last preceding the seasonal, intermittent,
8 or temporary work.

10 section or KRS 341.350, who is separated from employment pursuant to a labor

26 section, shall be the period of time beginning with the worker's discharge, voluntary
27 quitting, or failure to apply for or accept suitable work and running until the worker

9 employer notifies the Office of Unemployment Insurance in writing within
10 seven (7) days after the beginning of such alleged strike or labor dispute of the

21 administrative capacity in an institution of higher education as defined
22 in KRS 341.067(2) or in an educational institution as defined in KRS

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1578
1 a contract or a reasonable assurance that the worker will perform such
2 services in any such capacity for any institution or institutions of higher

8 period between two (2) successive academic years or terms, if the
9 worker performs such services in the first of such academic years or
10 terms and there is a reasonable assurance that the worker will perform
11 such services in the second of such academic years or terms; except that
12 if benefits are denied to any worker under this paragraph and such

16 a retroactive payment of benefits for each week for which the worker
17 filed a timely claim for benefits and for which benefits were denied

Page 6 of 8

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1578
1 institution of higher education or an educational institution, as defined in
2 KRS 341.067(2) or (4), while the worker is in the employ of an
3 educational service agency, and such unemployment begins during the

11 worker based on service other than as defined in subparagraph 1. of this
12 paragraph performed in an institution of higher education as defined in KRS
13 341.067(2) shall be deemed to have been paid as a result of Office of
14 Unemployment Insurance error and not recoverable by the cabinet or such
15 institution if such payment is improper by virtue of the retroactive application
16 to October 30, 1983, of subparagraph 2. of this paragraph; or

23 reasonable assurance that such individual will perform such services in the later of
24 such seasons or similar periods.
25 (3) (a) Benefits shall not be paid on the basis of services performed by an alien
26 unless such alien is an individual who was lawfully admitted for permanent
27 residence at the time such services were performed, was lawfully present for

2 under color of law at the time such services were performed, including an
3 alien who was lawfully present in the United States as a result of the
4 application of the provisions of Section 203(a)(7) or Section 212(d)(5) of the
5 Immigration and Nationality Act.
6 (b) Any data or information required of individuals applying for benefits to
7 determine whether benefits are not payable to them because of their alien
8 status shall be uniformly required from all applicants for benefits.
9 (c) In the case of an individual whose application for benefits would otherwise be
10 approved, no determination that benefits to such individual are not payable
11 because of his alien status shall be made except upon a preponderance of the
12 evidence.

4 Section 2. KRS 341.370 is amended to read as follows:
5 (1) A worker shall be disqualified from receiving benefits for the duration of any
6 period of unemployment with respect to which:
7 (a) He or she has failed without good cause either to apply for available, suitable
8 work when so directed by the employment office or the secretary, to accept an
9 interview from a prospective employer offering suitable work, or to accept
10 suitable work when offered him or her, or to return to his or her customary
11 self-employment when so directed by the secretary;
12 (b) He or she has been discharged for misconduct or dishonesty connected with
13 his or her most recent work, or from any work which occurred after the first
14 day of the worker's base period and which last preceded his or her most recent

10 months, for the additional weeks immediately following the date of discovery, not
11 to exceed a total of fifty-two (52), as may be determined by the secretary.

10 section or KRS 341.350, who is separated from employment pursuant to a labor

26 section, shall be the period of time beginning with the worker's discharge, voluntary
27 quitting, or failure to apply for or accept suitable work and running until the worker

10 seven (7) days after the beginning of such alleged strike or labor dispute of the
11 alleged existence of such strike or labor dispute. For the purpose of this
12 subsection, a lockout shall not be deemed to be a strike or a bona fide labor
