3 ïƒ¢Section 1. KRS 342.0011 is amended to read as follows:
4 As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires:
5 (1) (a) "Injury" means any work-related traumatic event or series of traumatic events,
6 including cumulative trauma, arising out of and in the course of employment which
7 is the proximate cause producing a harmful change in the human organism
8 evidenced by objective medical findings. "Injury" does not include the effects of the
9 natural aging process, and does not include any communicable disease unless the
10 risk of contracting the disease is increased by the nature of the employment.
11 "Injury" when used generally, unless the context indicates otherwise, shall include
12 an occupational disease and damage to a prosthetic appliance, but shall not include
13 a psychological, psychiatric, or stress-related change in the human organism, unless
14 it is a direct result of a physical injury.
15 (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, "injury" for a:
16 1. Police officer, firefighter, or emergency medical services personnel as
17 defined in KRS 61.315;
18 2. Front-line staff as defined in KRS 194A.065; or

20 KRS 38.010;

2 work is performed and the occupational disease, and which can be seen to have
3 followed as a natural incident to the work as a result of the exposure occasioned by
4 the nature of the employment and which can be fairly traced to the employment as
5 the proximate cause. The occupational disease shall be incidental to the character of
6 the business and not independent of the relationship of employer and employee. An

21 the severance or processing of coal bears to the total number of employees.
22 Any employee who is involved in the business of severing or processing of
23 coal and business activities not related to coal shall be prorated based on the

5 plus any reimbursements invoiced for losses, expenses, and fees charged
6 under the deductibles. The special fund assessment rates in effect for

9 insurance policy. For policies covering covered employees having a co-
10 employment relationship with a professional employer organization and a
11 client as defined in KRS Chapter 336, "premiums received" means premiums
12 calculated using the experience modification factor of each client as defined

14 pertaining to the covered employee.
15 (b) "Direct written premium" for insurance companies means the gross premium

5 schedule rating modifications, debits, or credits. For policies with provisions

10 adequate to cover the entire liability of the employer for compensation under
11 this chapter, including all expenses and allowances normally used to calculate

10 342.340(1) shall be the projected value of the employer's workers' compensation
11 claims for the next calendar year as calculated by the commissioner using
12 generally-accepted actuarial methods as follows:
13 (a) The base period shall be the earliest three (3) calendar years of the five (5)
14 calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year for which the
15 calculation is made. The commissioner shall identify each claim of the
16 employer which has an injury date or date of last injurious exposure to the
17 cause of an occupational disease during each one (1) of the three (3) calendar
18 years to be used as the base, and shall assign a value to each claim. The value
19 shall be the total of the indemnity benefits paid to date and projected to be
20 paid, adjusted to current benefit levels, plus the medical benefits paid to date
21 and projected to be paid for the life of the claim, plus the cost of medical and
22 vocational rehabilitation paid to date and projected to be paid. Adjustment to
23 current benefit levels shall be done by multiplying the weekly indemnity
24 benefit for each claim by the number obtained by dividing the statewide
25 average weekly wage which will be in effect for the year for which the
26 premium is being calculated by the statewide average weekly wage in effect
27 during the year in which the injury or date of the last exposure occurred. The
Page 9 of 14
XXXX 1/13/2025 3:26 PM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1228
1 total value of the claims using the adjusted weekly benefit shall then be
2 calculated by the commissioner. Values for claims in which awards have been
3 made or settlements reached because of findings of permanent partial or
4 permanent total disability shall be calculated using the mortality and interest
5 discount assumptions used in the latest available statistical plan of the
6 advisory rating organization defined in Subtitle 13 of KRS Chapter 304. The
7 sum of all calculated values shall be computed for all claims in the base
8 period;
9 (b) The commissioner shall obtain the annual payroll for each of the three (3)
10 years in the base period for each employer carrying his or her own risk from
11 records of the department and from the records of the Department of
12 Workforce Development, Education and Labor Cabinet. The commissioner
13 shall multiply each of the three (3) years of payroll by the number obtained by
14 dividing the statewide average weekly wage which will be in effect for the
15 year in which the premium is being calculated by the statewide average
16 weekly wage in effect in each of the years of the base period;
17 (c) The commissioner shall divide the total of the adjusted claim values for the
18 three (3) year base period by the total adjusted payroll for the same three (3)
19 year period. The value so calculated shall be multiplied by 1.25 and shall then
20 be multiplied by the employer's most recent annualized payroll, calculated
21 using records of the department and the Department of Workforce
22 Development data which shall be made available for this purpose on a
23 quarterly basis as reported, to obtain the premium for the next calendar year
24 for assessment purposes under KRS 342.122;
25 (d) For November 1, 1987, through December 31, 1988, premium for each
26 employer carrying its own risk shall be an amount calculated by the board
27 pursuant to the provisions contained in this subsection and such premium
Page 10 of 14
XXXX 1/13/2025 3:26 PM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1228
1 shall be provided to each employer carrying its own risk and to the funding
2 commission on or before January 1, 1988. Thereafter, the calculations set
3 forth in this subsection shall be performed annually, at the time each employer
4 applies or renews its application for certification to carry its own risk for the
5 next twelve (12) month period and submits payroll and other data in support
6 of the application. The employer and the funding commission shall be notified
7 at the time of the certification or recertification of the premium calculated by
8 the commissioner, which shall form the employer's basis for assessments
9 pursuant to KRS 342.122 for the calendar year beginning on January 1
10 following the date of certification or recertification;
11 (e) If an employer having fewer than five (5) years of doing business in this state
12 applies to carry its own risk and is so certified, its premium for the purposes
13 of KRS 342.122 shall be based on the lesser number of years of experience as
14 may be available including the two (2) most recent years if necessary to create
15 a three (3) year base period. If the employer has less than two (2) years of
16 operation in this state available for the premium calculation, then its premium
17 shall be the greater of the value obtained by the calculation called for in this
18 subsection or the amount of security required by the commissioner pursuant to
19 KRS 342.340(1);
20 (f) If an employer is certified to carry its own risk after having previously insured
21 the risk, its premium shall be calculated using values obtained from claims
22 incurred while insured for as many of the years of the base period as may be
23 necessary to create a full three (3) year base. After the employer is certified to
24 carry its own risk and has paid all amounts due for assessments upon
25 premiums paid while insured, the employer shall be assessed only upon the
26 premium calculated under this subsection;
27 (g) "Premium" for each employer defined in KRS 342.630(2) shall be calculated

10 ïƒ¢SECTION 2. A NEW SECTION OF KRS CHAPTER 342 IS CREATED TO
11 READ AS FOLLOWS:
12 (1) As used in this section:
13 (a) "Emergency medical services personnel" has the same meaning as in KRS
14 61.315;
15 (b) "Firefighter" has the same meaning as in KRS 61.315;
16 (c) "Front-line staff" has the same meaning as in KRS 194A.065;
17 (d) "Kentucky National Guard member" means a member on state active duty
18 as defined in KRS 38.010;
19 (e) "Police officer" has the same meaning as in KRS 61.315; and

24 psychiatric, or stress-related change in the human organism that is not a direct
25 result of a physical injury but is the result of a work-related event or cumulative
26 work-related stress, then that psychological, psychiatric, or stress-related change
27 shall be considered an injury arising out of and in the course of employment if it
Page 13 of 14
XXXX 1/13/2025 3:26 PM Jacketed
UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1228
1 is demonstrated by the preponderance of the evidence that:
2 (a) The work-related event or cumulative work-related stress was extraordinary
3 and unusual in comparison to pressures and tensions experienced by the
4 average employee across all occupations; and
5 (b) The work-related event or cumulative work-related stress, and not some
6 other event, was the proximate cause of the psychological, psychiatric, or
7 stress-related change in the human organism.
8 (3) A psychological, psychiatric, or stress-related change in the human organism
9 shall not be considered an injury arising out of and in the course of employment
10 if it results from any disciplinary action, work evaluation, job transfer, layoff,
11 demotion, termination, or similar action taken in good faith by the employer.
12 (4) (a) If a police officer, firefighter, emergency medical services personnel, front-
13 line staff member, or a Kentucky National Guard member is diagnosed with
14 post-traumatic stress disorder by a qualified mental health professional
15 within three (3) years of the last active date of employment as a police
16 officer, firefighter, emergency medical services personnel, front-line staff
17 member, or Kentucky National Guard member, then there shall be a
18 rebuttable presumption that the post-traumatic stress disorder is an injury
19 covered by this chapter, and the employer with whom the employee was last
20 injuriously exposed to the harmful stress shall be exclusively liable for
21 benefits.
22 (b) A presumption of a work-related injury under paragraph (a) of this
23 subsection may be overcome by the preponderance of the evidence that the
24 post-traumatic stress disorder was caused by nonservice-connected risk
25 factors or nonservice-connected exposure.

1 AN ACT relating to workers' compensation for first responders.
2 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:
3 ïƒ¢Section 1. KRS 342.0011 is amended to read as follows:
4 As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires:
5 (1) (a) "Injury" means any work-related traumatic event or series of traumatic events,
6 including cumulative trauma, arising out of and in the course of employment which
7 is the proximate cause producing a harmful change in the human organism
8 evidenced by objective medical findings. "Injury" does not include the effects of the
9 natural aging process, and does not include any communicable disease unless the
10 risk of contracting the disease is increased by the nature of the employment.
11 "Injury" when used generally, unless the context indicates otherwise, shall include
12 an occupational disease and damage to a prosthetic appliance, but shall not include
13 a psychological, psychiatric, or stress-related change in the human organism, unless
14 it is a direct result of a physical injury.
15 (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, "injury" for a:
16 1. Police officer, firefighter, or emergency medical services personnel as
17 defined in KRS 61.315;
18 2. Front-line staff as defined in KRS 194A.065; or
19 3. Kentucky National Guard member on state active duty as defined in
20 KRS 38.010;

4 the nature of the employment and which can be fairly traced to the employment as
5 the proximate cause. The occupational disease shall be incidental to the character of
6 the business and not independent of the relationship of employer and employee. An
7 occupational disease need not have been foreseen or expected but, after its

5 an injury, has a permanent disability rating and has a complete and permanent
6 inability to perform any type of work as a result of an injury, except that total

19 charge is not made, shall be deemed to be engaged in the severance or
20 processing of coal only to the extent that the number of employees engaged in
21 the severance or processing of coal bears to the total number of employees.
22 Any employee who is involved in the business of severing or processing of
23 coal and business activities not related to coal shall be prorated based on the

1 the cost for coverage for insurance policies or other evidence of coverage

10 342.340(1) shall be the projected value of the employer's workers' compensation
11 claims for the next calendar year as calculated by the commissioner using
12 generally-accepted actuarial methods as follows:
13 (a) The base period shall be the earliest three (3) calendar years of the five (5)
14 calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year for which the
15 calculation is made. The commissioner shall identify each claim of the
16 employer which has an injury date or date of last injurious exposure to the
17 cause of an occupational disease during each one (1) of the three (3) calendar
18 years to be used as the base, and shall assign a value to each claim. The value
19 shall be the total of the indemnity benefits paid to date and projected to be
20 paid, adjusted to current benefit levels, plus the medical benefits paid to date
21 and projected to be paid for the life of the claim, plus the cost of medical and
22 vocational rehabilitation paid to date and projected to be paid. Adjustment to
23 current benefit levels shall be done by multiplying the weekly indemnity
24 benefit for each claim by the number obtained by dividing the statewide
25 average weekly wage which will be in effect for the year for which the
26 premium is being calculated by the statewide average weekly wage in effect
27 during the year in which the injury or date of the last exposure occurred. The
Page 9 of 14
XXXX 1/13/2025 3:26 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1228
1 total value of the claims using the adjusted weekly benefit shall then be
2 calculated by the commissioner. Values for claims in which awards have been
3 made or settlements reached because of findings of permanent partial or
4 permanent total disability shall be calculated using the mortality and interest
5 discount assumptions used in the latest available statistical plan of the
6 advisory rating organization defined in Subtitle 13 of KRS Chapter 304. The
7 sum of all calculated values shall be computed for all claims in the base
8 period;
9 (b) The commissioner shall obtain the annual payroll for each of the three (3)
10 years in the base period for each employer carrying his or her own risk from
11 records of the department and from the records of the Department of
12 Workforce Development, Education and Labor Cabinet. The commissioner
13 shall multiply each of the three (3) years of payroll by the number obtained by
14 dividing the statewide average weekly wage which will be in effect for the
15 year in which the premium is being calculated by the statewide average
16 weekly wage in effect in each of the years of the base period;
17 (c) The commissioner shall divide the total of the adjusted claim values for the
18 three (3) year base period by the total adjusted payroll for the same three (3)
19 year period. The value so calculated shall be multiplied by 1.25 and shall then
20 be multiplied by the employer's most recent annualized payroll, calculated
21 using records of the department and the Department of Workforce
22 Development data which shall be made available for this purpose on a
23 quarterly basis as reported, to obtain the premium for the next calendar year
24 for assessment purposes under KRS 342.122;
25 (d) For November 1, 1987, through December 31, 1988, premium for each
26 employer carrying its own risk shall be an amount calculated by the board
27 pursuant to the provisions contained in this subsection and such premium
Page 10 of 14
XXXX 1/13/2025 3:26 PM Jacketed

UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 1228
1 shall be provided to each employer carrying its own risk and to the funding
2 commission on or before January 1, 1988. Thereafter, the calculations set
3 forth in this subsection shall be performed annually, at the time each employer
4 applies or renews its application for certification to carry its own risk for the
5 next twelve (12) month period and submits payroll and other data in support
6 of the application. The employer and the funding commission shall be notified
7 at the time of the certification or recertification of the premium calculated by
8 the commissioner, which shall form the employer's basis for assessments
9 pursuant to KRS 342.122 for the calendar year beginning on January 1
10 following the date of certification or recertification;
11 (e) If an employer having fewer than five (5) years of doing business in this state
12 applies to carry its own risk and is so certified, its premium for the purposes
13 of KRS 342.122 shall be based on the lesser number of years of experience as
14 may be available including the two (2) most recent years if necessary to create
15 a three (3) year base period. If the employer has less than two (2) years of
16 operation in this state available for the premium calculation, then its premium
17 shall be the greater of the value obtained by the calculation called for in this
18 subsection or the amount of security required by the commissioner pursuant to
19 KRS 342.340(1);
20 (f) If an employer is certified to carry its own risk after having previously insured
21 the risk, its premium shall be calculated using values obtained from claims
22 incurred while insured for as many of the years of the base period as may be
23 necessary to create a full three (3) year base. After the employer is certified to
24 carry its own risk and has paid all amounts due for assessments upon
25 premiums paid while insured, the employer shall be assessed only upon the
26 premium calculated under this subsection;
27 (g) "Premium" for each employer defined in KRS 342.630(2) shall be calculated

1 as set forth in this subsection; and
2 (h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, the premium of any
3 employer authorized to carry its own risk for purposes of assessments due
4 under this chapter shall be no less than thirty cents ($0.30) per one hundred

6 covered by this chapter;

8 Code contained in the latest edition of the Standard Industrial Classification Manual
9 published by the Federal Office of Management and Budget;

12 (1) As used in this section:
13 (a) "Emergency medical services personnel" has the same meaning as in KRS
14 61.315;
15 (b) "Firefighter" has the same meaning as in KRS 61.315;
16 (c) "Front-line staff" has the same meaning as in KRS 194A.065;
17 (d) "Kentucky National Guard member" means a member on state active duty
18 as defined in KRS 38.010;
19 (e) "Police officer" has the same meaning as in KRS 61.315; and

1 is demonstrated by the preponderance of the evidence that:
2 (a) The work-related event or cumulative work-related stress was extraordinary
3 and unusual in comparison to pressures and tensions experienced by the
4 average employee across all occupations; and
5 (b) The work-related event or cumulative work-related stress, and not some
6 other event, was the proximate cause of the psychological, psychiatric, or
7 stress-related change in the human organism.
8 (3) A psychological, psychiatric, or stress-related change in the human organism
9 shall not be considered an injury arising out of and in the course of employment
10 if it results from any disciplinary action, work evaluation, job transfer, layoff,
11 demotion, termination, or similar action taken in good faith by the employer.
12 (4) (a) If a police officer, firefighter, emergency medical services personnel, front-
13 line staff member, or a Kentucky National Guard member is diagnosed with
14 post-traumatic stress disorder by a qualified mental health professional
15 within three (3) years of the last active date of employment as a police
16 officer, firefighter, emergency medical services personnel, front-line staff
17 member, or Kentucky National Guard member, then there shall be a
18 rebuttable presumption that the post-traumatic stress disorder is an injury
19 covered by this chapter, and the employer with whom the employee was last
20 injuriously exposed to the harmful stress shall be exclusively liable for
21 benefits.
22 (b) A presumption of a work-related injury under paragraph (a) of this
23 subsection may be overcome by the preponderance of the evidence that the
24 post-traumatic stress disorder was caused by nonservice-connected risk
25 factors or nonservice-connected exposure.
