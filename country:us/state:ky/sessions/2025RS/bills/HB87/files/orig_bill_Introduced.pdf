3 SECTION 1. A NEW SECTION OF KRS 335B.010 TO 335B.070 IS
4 CREATED TO READ AS FOLLOWS:
5 The General Assembly finds a compelling public interest in removing barriers to
6 employment opportunities and occupational licenses for citizens of the Commonwealth
7 who have been convicted of a crime. Employers can increase their hiring prospects by
8 offering positions to this historically untapped pool of workers who have taken
9 rehabilitative steps in preparation for participation in the workforce, and reenter
10 society as productive citizens, rather than being defined by a past crime.

17 position of public employment or an occupation for which a professional license
18 is required. A hiring or licensing authority shall display on its website its

20 background. The application instructions shall include the following:
21 (a) That the application process may include a background check by the

25 position of public employment or an occupational license; and
