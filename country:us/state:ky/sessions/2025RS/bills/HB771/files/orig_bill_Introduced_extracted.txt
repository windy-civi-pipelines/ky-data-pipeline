15 regulations shall:
16 1. Require the secretary to determine the appropriate number of job
17 categories to be evaluated and a method for rating each category;

19 which shall be documented on the evaluation form and pertinent
20 comments by either the employee or supervisor may be included;

17 regulations promulgated by the commissioner of the Department of Kentucky State
18 Police under authority granted in KRS Chapter 16 conflict with this section or any
