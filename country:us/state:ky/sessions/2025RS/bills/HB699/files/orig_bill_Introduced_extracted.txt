20 candidate or by an opposing candidate by summary proceedings consisting of a
21 motion before the Circuit Court of the judicial circuit in which the candidate whose
22 bona fides is questioned resides. An action regarding the bona fides of the nominee
23 of a political party or a nonpartisan or judicial nominee may be commenced at any
24 time prior to the primary. An action regarding the bona fides for election to an
25 office as a member of a political organization, political group, or as an independent

5 (4)[(3)] In any action or proceeding under this section the burden of proof as to the
6 bona fides of a candidate shall be on the person challenging the bona fides of a
