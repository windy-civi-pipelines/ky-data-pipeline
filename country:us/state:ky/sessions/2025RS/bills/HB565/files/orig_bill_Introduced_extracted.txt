6 Section 17. KRS 186.416 is amended to read as follows:

14 operator's license, upon the date of the license holder's twenty-first birthday,

4 having to take a written test or road test.
5 2. The spouse or dependent of a person identified in subparagraph 1. of

7 subparagraph regarding the renewal of an expired operator's license.
8 (b) A person who meets the criteria in paragraph (a) of this subsection shall not
9 be convicted or cited for driving on an expired license prior to license renewal
10 during the ninety (90) days after the person's return to the Commonwealth if
11 the person can provide proof of his or her out-of-state service and dates of
12 assignment.
13 (c) A person who meets the criteria in paragraph (a) of this subsection and who
14 does not renew his or her license within ninety (90) days of returning to the

16 chapter governing renewal of a license that has expired.

8 request that an operator's license or a personal identification card issued under
9 this chapter bear the word "veteran" on the face or the back of the license or
10 personal identification card.
11 (b) The designation shall be in a style and format considered appropriate by the
12 Transportation Cabinet. Prior to obtaining a designation requested under this
13 subsection, the applicant shall present to the cabinet as proof of eligibility, an
14 original or copy of his or her:
15 1. Unexpired Veteran Identification Card or Veteran Health Identification
16 Card issued by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs;
