( HCR 22 )
of providing baseload electricity to the residents and businesses of the Commonwealth.
WHEREAS, for decades, a moratorium on the construction of nuclear power facilities in Kentucky caused the
Commonwealth to fall behind the rest of the country in the development and deployment of nuclear power, including
the neighboring states of Illinois, Tennessee, Ohio, and Virginia; and
WHEREAS, in 2017, the General Assembly lifted the long-standing nuclear moratorium in the
Commonwealth with the passage of Senate Bill 11; and
WHEREAS, in 2023, the General Assembly passed Senate Joint Resolution 79 to convene a working group of
state officials and representatives of the utility and nuclear industries to advise the General Assembly on the
establishment of a permanent nuclear energy commission to provide for the education, coordination of resources, and
professional expertise necessary to foster the development of the nuclear industry in the Commonwealth; and
WHEREAS, as a result of the report produced by the Nuclear Energy Development Working Group, and with
the passage of Senate Bill 198 in 2024, the General Assembly established the Kentucky Nuclear Energy
Development Authority to serve as the nonregulatory, trusted state government agency on nuclear energy issues and
to support and facilitate the development of the nuclear energy ecosystem across the Commonwealth; and
WHEREAS, interest in developing the nuclear energy industry in Kentucky has never been greater for many
reasons, including the emergence of promising new nuclear technologies like small modular reactors that may be
useful in a range of applications in the Commonwealth and the need for new baseload energy generation to be sited in
the Commonwealth in order to maintain the resiliency and reliability of the electric grid; and
WHEREAS, nuclear power should be an important part of the Commonwealth's all of the above energy
approach; and
WHEREAS, nuclear power is an excellent option for generating large amounts of baseload electricity that is
reliable, dispatchable, and produces no emissions while in operation; and
WHEREAS, the practice of reprocessing spent nuclear fuel for reuse reduces the volume of high-level wastes
produced from the nuclear energy generation process and decreases demand for new fuel, both of which contribute to
the cleanliness of nuclear energy as a baseload electricity source; and
WHEREAS, the nuclear industry is among the most thoroughly tested and regulated industries in the world,
and nuclear power plants constructed in the United States are well designed to withstand natural disasters like floods,
droughts, earthquakes, and hurricanes, as well as man-made threats;
NOW, THEREFORE,
Be it resolved by the House of Representatives of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, the
Senate concurring therein:
Section 1. The General Assembly finds and declares that nuclear power generation is a clean and
dispatchable means of providing baseload electricity to the residents and businesses of the Commonwealth, and that
adding nuclear power to Kentucky's energy portfolio would result in a more resilient and reliable electric grid.
Section 2. The General Assembly further finds that adding nuclear power generation to Kentucky's energy
portfolio in a timely manner is more important than ever given the speed of ongoing retirements of fossil fuel-fired
generation resources in the Commonwealth, which have provided reliable and dispatchable baseload electricity for
decades but are being replaced with intermittent and less reliable generation resources that are not capable of
providing baseload power.
