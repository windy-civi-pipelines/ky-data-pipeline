UNOFFICIAL COPY 25 RS BR 292
1 A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION declaring that nuclear power generation is a
2 clean and dispatchable means of providing baseload electricity to the residents and
3 businesses of the Commonwealth.
4 WHEREAS, for decades, a moratorium on the construction of nuclear power
5 facilities in Kentucky caused the Commonwealth to fall behind the rest of the country in
6 the development and deployment of nuclear power, including the neighboring states of
7 Illinois, Tennessee, Ohio, and Virginia; and
8 WHEREAS, in 2017, the General Assembly lifted the long-standing nuclear
9 moratorium in the Commonwealth with the passage of Senate Bill 11; and
10 WHEREAS, in 2023, the General Assembly passed Senate Joint Resolution 79 to
11 convene a working group of state officials and representatives of the utility and nuclear
12 industries to advise the General Assembly on the establishment of a permanent nuclear
13 energy commission to provide for the education, coordination of resources, and
14 professional expertise necessary to foster the development of the nuclear industry in the
15 Commonwealth; and
16 WHEREAS, as a result of the report produced by the Nuclear Energy Development
17 Working Group, and with the passage of Senate Bill 198 in 2024, the General Assembly
18 established the Kentucky Nuclear Energy Development Authority to serve as the
19 nonregulatory, trusted state government agency on nuclear energy issues and to support
20 and facilitate the development of the nuclear energy ecosystem across the
21 Commonwealth; and
22 WHEREAS, interest in developing the nuclear energy industry in Kentucky has
23 never been greater for many reasons, including the emergence of promising new nuclear
24 technologies like small modular reactors that may be useful in a range of applications in
25 the Commonwealth and the need for new baseload energy generation to be sited in the
26 Commonwealth in order to maintain the resiliency and reliability of the electric grid; and
27 WHEREAS, nuclear power should be an important part of the Commonwealth's all

1 of the above energy approach; and
2 WHEREAS, nuclear power is an excellent option for generating large amounts of
3 baseload electricity that is reliable, dispatchable, and produces no emissions while in
4 operation; and
5 WHEREAS, the nuclear industry is among the most thoroughly tested and regulated
6 industries in the world, and nuclear power plants constructed in the United States are well
7 designed to withstand natural disasters like floods, droughts, earthquakes, and hurricanes,
8 as well as man-made threats;
9 NOW, THEREFORE,
10 Be it resolved by the House of Representatives of the General Assembly of the
11 Commonwealth of Kentucky, the Senate concurring therein:
12 Section 1. The General Assembly finds and declares that nuclear power
13 generation is a clean and dispatchable means of providing baseload electricity to the
14 residents and businesses of the Commonwealth, and that adding nuclear power to
15 Kentucky's energy portfolio would result in a more resilient and reliable electric grid.
16 Section 2. The General Assembly further finds that adding nuclear power
17 generation to Kentucky's energy portfolio in a timely manner is more important than ever
18 given the speed of ongoing retirements of fossil fuel-fired generation resources in the
19 Commonwealth, which have provided reliable and dispatchable baseload electricity for
20 decades but are being replaced with intermittent and less reliable generation resources
21 that are not capable of providing baseload power.
