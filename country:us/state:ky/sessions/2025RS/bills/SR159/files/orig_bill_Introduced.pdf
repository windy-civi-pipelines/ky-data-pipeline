2 Hamilton.

4 over 20 years; and
5 WHEREAS, until her passing in October 2024, Stephanie Hamilton was the owner
6 and operator of long-standing community business, Brooksville Child Care and Learning
7 Center, an educational center for children aged newborn to 11 years, where she left a
8 lasting impression on each child in her care; and
9 WHEREAS, not only was Stephanie Hamilton a local business owner and educator,
10 she was a very involved community volunteer. She spent many years as a member of the

12 County Schools Family Resources and Youth Services Center Advisory Council, the
13 Bracken County Schools Site-Based Decision Making Council, the Bracken County

22 much so that the Bracken County Chamber of Commerce recently named its annual
23 Community Impact Awards Citizen of the Year award in honor of her; and
